LCPD has no cure, and the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes the orthopedic nurse. LCPD is associated with high morbidity if the diagnosis is missed or delayed. For children with mild disease, non-surgical treatment is recommended with activity restriction and protective weight-bearing until ossification is complete. Clinicians should know that the current literature does not support the use of orthotics, braces, or casts. To improve patient outcomes, all cases should be referred to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon as soon as the diagnosis is made. AN orthopedic specialty nurse can help coordinate PT for the patient, along with palliative pharmaceutical care (NSAIDs), and monitor the case for the orthopedist in-between visits. The physical therapist should keep all members of the team informed regarding the progress, or any changes in status, reporting through the nurse to the orthopedist. These are a few examples of interprofessional collaboration that can lead to improved outcomes in these cases. [Level 5]
