# Continuing Education Activity

The hepatitis B vaccine is a medication used to prevent hepatitis B infection, which can lead to chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for the hepatitis B vaccine as a valuable agent in preventing hepatitis B infection. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other vital factors pertinent for healthcare team members in reducing the burden of hepatitis B on their patients and community.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism of action of the hepatitis B vaccine. 
- Describe the administration regimens of the hepatitis B vaccine. 
- Explain the monitoring for patients receiving the hepatitis B vaccine, including any toxicity.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst the healthcare team to enhance care delivery for patients receiving the hepatitis B vaccine.

# Indications

Public health officials have ranked the reduction in vaccine-preventable diseases as one of the top 10 public health achievements in the 21 century.

The first hepatitis B vaccine received FDA approval for use in the United States in 1981, with a recombinant version coming to market in 1986 that replaced the original blood-derived vaccine.

- Persons at risk for sexually transmitted disease

- Incarcerated persons

- Persons whose sex partner is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive

- HBsAg positive household contacts

- Men who have sex with men

- Intravenous drug users

- Healthcare workers, dialysis patients

- Persons with diabetes aged 19 to 59 years old

- Persons with hepatitis C

- Travelers to countries endemic for hepatitis B

- Persons with HIV

- Persons with chronic liver disease

- All persons seeking protection from hepatitis B

This strategy has been largely effective. The vaccination itself benefits not just the vaccinated but the entire community. The increasing immunization rate has shown to reduce morbidity and mortality from the virus.

# Mechanism of Action

The vaccine is a non-infectious subunit of the virus, which leads to an active immunity. Antibodies produced by vaccination target the outer protein coat or surface antigen. This leads to protection against all genotypes (A through H) of the virus and gives a broad immunity.

It is generally accepted that the hepatitis B vaccine confers lifelong protection; originally, it was thought to only last around eight years, but more recent research has confirmed ongoing immunity for at least 25 years in those individuals who demonstrated a good immune response from the vaccine series.

Patients who fail to develop a good response from the vaccine tend to be over 40 years of age, obese, have celiac disease, smoke tobacco, or misuse alcohol. This last group will especially be affected if they have progressed to liver disease.

# Administration

Intramuscular injection is the preferred administration method. The intradermal route is not recommended. The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle. A regimen of three doses of the recombinant vaccine over six months is the current preferred method. A new vaccine has received approval for adults in the United States, which requires just two doses in one month.

After completing the three vaccination series, patients may receive a blood test after one to four months to determine the immune response, which is defined as an anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-Hbs) antibody level exceeding 100mIU/mL. An antibody response falling between 10 and 100 mIU/mL demonstrates an inadequate response; these patients should get a single booster shot, but do not require a retest. Responses below 10 mIU/mL require additional testing to check for prior hepatitis B infection, and these patients should receive another three-dose regimen with testing again at the one to four-month mark. Continued failed response warrants may require more aggressive interventions, including intradermal administration, high-dose vaccine, or double dosing of combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine. Should this fail, the patient will need hepatitis B immunoglobulin upon any exposure to the hepatitis B virus.

# Adverse Effects

Research has demonstrated the hepatitis B vaccine to be safe for all age groups.

# Contraindications

Hepatitis B vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to any components of the vaccine or a yeast hypersensitivity.

# Monitoring

Hepatitis B surface antibody titers increase quickly following vaccination and then decrease over time.

Health care workers who completed the vaccine series and had a subsequent positive titer (≥10 mIU/mL anti-HBs) are considered hepatitis B immune and do not need any further routine testing for protection so long as they remain immune-competent.

# Toxicity

The vaccine is not known to have any dose-dependent toxicity, especially with newer nanoparticle formulations.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The interprofessional health care team faces many challenges when vaccinating patients for hepatitis B. While few medical interventions have as significant an impact on health as vaccinations, and the hepatitis B vaccination is generally safe, lack of knowledge about the vaccine by healthcare team members and patient concern about adverse events can decrease coverage. Challenges on knowledge of the vaccine for healthcare team members include staying current on evolving recommendations for whom the vaccine is indicated.

Nurses should always verify the patient's vaccination status regarding hepatitis B (as well as other vaccines) and report their findings to the clinician. Many states in the USA allow pharmacists to administer the vaccine, and pharmacists should reinforce the counsel from the provider and nursing staff and update the patient's record with each dose. In this manner, the entire interprofessional team can operate from the same data regarding vaccination status, leading to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Of note, there is a new adjuvanted vaccination in development, now approved for adults in the United States for adults, which would reduce the time for series completion from a six-month 3-dose series to a one-month 2-dose series.
