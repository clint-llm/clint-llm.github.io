Differential diagnoses may include cervical disc injuries, cervical spine sprain/strain injuries, atlantoaxial joint pain, cervical facet syndrome, cervical myofascial pain, fibromyalgia, or spondylosis.

Cervical discogenic pain syndrome is initially treated conservatively,Â so it is important to rule out the following clinical parameters promptly:

- Cancer (age over 50, history of cancer, unexplained weight loss)

- Infection (recent surgery, history of drug use, fever/chills)

- Trauma (motor vehicle accident, work-related injury, sports-related injury, previous neck surgery)

- Neurological deficits (weakness, loss of reflex, bowel/bladder issues)
