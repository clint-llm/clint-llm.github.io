- Junction of the posterior communicating artery with the internal carotid artery

- Bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery

**Common Sites in the Posterior Circulation**

- Top of the basilar artery called the basilar apex

- Junction of the basilar artery and the superior or anterior inferior cerebellar arteries
