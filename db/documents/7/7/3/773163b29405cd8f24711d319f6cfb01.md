Different products have differing lipase/protease/amylase ratios; pancrelipase products are not interchangeable; patients should not switch between products.

Patients should take this medication with meals; a general rule of thumb is to take half a dose of pancrelipase with snacks.

Adult dosing for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency:

- 500 to 2500 lipase units/kg/dose orally with each meal or snack.

Pediatric dosing for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency:

- Ages 1 to 3: 1000 to 2500 lipase units/kg/dose orally with each meal or snack; start with 1000 lipase units/kg with each meal or snack. The maximum dose is 6000 lipase units/kg/meal.

- Ages 4 to 11: 500 to 2500 lipase units/kg/dose orally with each meal or snack; start with 500 lipase units/kg/ with each meal or snack. The maximum dose is 6000 lipase units/kg/meal.

- Ages 12 and over: 500 to 2500 lipase units/kg/dose orally with each meal or snack; start with 500 lipase units/kg/meal.

Caps may be opened and sprinkled on soft food with a pH of 4.5 or lower, but patients must not crush or chew the contents. Doses exceeding 2500 lipase units/kg/meal, over 4000 lipase units per gram of fat ingested daily, or more than 10,000 lipase units/kg/day require objective evidence of improved therapeutic efficacy.

Most manufacturers recommend that patients not exceed 10,000 units of lipase/kg per day.
