**An Evidence-based Approach to Thiazide Diuretics**

Besides physicians, the use of thiazide diuretics is also monitored by pharmacists and nurses, collaborating with clinicians as an interprofessional team. In most cases, a thiazide is prescribed for long periods, and hence, patient electrolyte levels require monitoring. Also, polypharmacy must be avoided, especially in the elderly. Patients need education on the adverse effects of these agents and their presentation. For those patients with heart problems and susceptibility to arrhythmias, the levels of potassium must be closely followed. Also, the patient needs to be weighed at each visit to ensure that the fluid overload is resolving. Patients prone to hypokalemia must receive education on the consumption of foods that are rich in potassium. Finally, the clinical team needs to follow the patient's lipid levels need to be followed as thiazides c cause hyperlipidemia. By utilizing an interprofessional team approach, these adverse events can remain in check, and therapeutic benefit maximized.

**Outcomes**

Thiazide diuretics have been in use for over half a century and are relatively safe and effective drugs for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. These drugs are used in outpatients to manage chronic edema states. The majority of patients do respond to these agents, and the most common adverse effect reported is hypokalemia. To date, there are only a few reports of arrhythmias in patients taking thiazides.
