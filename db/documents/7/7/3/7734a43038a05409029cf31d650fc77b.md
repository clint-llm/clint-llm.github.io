The role of baroreceptors is to control the equilibrium of blood pressure and heart rate. The autonomic nervous system receives information via baroreceptors, which are distributed in the carotid sinus, aortic arch, and great blood vessels. This control forms an arc consisted of afferent limb; baroreceptors sense stretch and change of pressure, and send signals through the glossopharyngeal nerve (baroreceptors in the carotid sinus) and vagus nerve (baroreceptors in the aortic arch) to the solitary nucleus of the medulla, which sends signals through the efferent limb; consist of sympathetic (activated if there are a decreased blood pressure or wall stretch) and parasympathetic (activated if there is an increased blood pressure or wall stretch) effects causing:

- Hypotension and bradycardia (parasympathetic).

- Hypertension and tachycardia (sympathetic).

The exact mechanism behind CSH is not well understood and might be at any point in the previous pathways. However, what seems to be clear is that stretching or mechanical pressure over the carotid sinus overshoots signals resulting in hypotension or bradycardia or both.

Recent data suggests that the theory of decreased arterial compliance due to atherosclerosis of carotids with aging and the decreased afferent reflux resulting in compensatory upregulation of the postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoreceptor in the brainstem is not true because afferent limb of the carotid sinus reflex was normal in the CSH population, and the study on 18 patients with CSH failed to attenuate baroreflex in patients with CSH after the administration of Yohimbine (alpha-2-receptors antagonist), meaning the alpha-2 receptors upregulation have no role in CSH.
