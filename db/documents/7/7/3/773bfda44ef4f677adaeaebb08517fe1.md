Muscle energy techniques (METs) are attributed to an American osteopath, Fred Mitchell Senior. Employing complex neurological mechanisms, including the neuromuscular spindles and the Golgi tendon organs, following guided muscle contractions, a shortened muscle can be stretched until it reaches a new resting length.

METs represent a manual treatment modality that involves the voluntary contraction of some muscles of the patient in a very precise direction, with different levels of intensity, carried out towards a counterforce exerted specifically by the operator.These techniques classify as active or direct techniques.

Isometric and concentric isotonic contraction can be used in three different ways on the dysfunction:

- Isometric contraction opposed to the restriction.

- Isometric contraction towards the restriction

- Concentric isotonic contraction towards restriction

Indications:

- HypertonicÂ muscles

- Somatic dysfunction of muscle or joint

- Limited ROM of joint

- To decrease localized edema and reduce congestion (pumping of the venous and lymphatic systems)
