Rh-hemolytic disease develops due to the conception of an Rh-negative female with an Rh-positive fetus and can cause a broad range of symptoms in the fetus/neonate. Early diagnosis and prophylaxis are crucial in this condition, especially with known high rates of neonatal mortality if it remains undiagnosed. This activity outlines the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of Rh hemolytic disease, as well as the role of the interprofessional team in the care of these patients and improving health outcomes globally.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Rh-hemolytic disease.
- Review the clinical presentation of patients with Rh-hemolytic disease.
- Outline the management of patients with Rh-hemolytic disease.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care coordination of patients with Rh-hemolytic disease.
