Fifty percent of patients have a spontaneous mutation, and the other half have an inherited mutation. There is a 100% penetrance with variable expressivity. Neurofibromatosis type 2 makes up about 3% of all cases and has a prevalence between 1 in 33,000 births and 1 in 87,410. There is no gender or race predilection. Neurofibromatosis type 2 has variable presentations amongst different families. A more severe clinical presentation is associated with a frameshift or a nonsense mutation that results in a truncated protein.
