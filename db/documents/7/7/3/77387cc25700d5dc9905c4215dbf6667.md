Given that the area postrema plays a role in vomiting and impacts the systems of feeding, metabolism, and the heart, it has an indirect effect on the muscles involved. Â After it relays information to the nucleus tractus solitarius, distinct neural outputs are sent to coordinate effector responses of emesis including swallowing, salivation, cardiovascular, respiration, and gastrointestinal in a structured manner. Some of these results include contraction of the diaphragm via abdominal muscles, external intercostal muscles while internal intercostal muscles relax; esophageal contraction; relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter; gastric dysrhythmia; and duodenal retro-peristaltic activity in duodenum and stomach.
