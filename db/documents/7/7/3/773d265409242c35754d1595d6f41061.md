Blood pressure, blood glucose, electrolytes, weight, bone mineral density, HPA hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, and intraocular pressure all require monitoring in patients taking methylprednisolone. Growth and development monitoring should be in place for children.

Patients receiving methylprednisolone must be monitored carefully for the development of hyperglycemia, glycosuria, sodium retention with edema or hypertension, hypokalemia, peptic ulcers, osteoporosis, and hidden infections.

The dosage should be as low as possible. Even patients maintained on low doses of methylprednisolone may require supplementary therapy at times of stress, such as during surgery, intercurrent illness, or trauma occurs.
