The FDA approveD dobutamine for short-term use in patients with decreased contractility due to heart failure or cardiac surgical procedures leading to cardiac decompensation. The agent has not been shown to give positive outcomes in the hospitalized or outpatient setting for heart failure patients despite hemodynamically improving the patient's condition. Dobutamine can be used as temporary intravenous inotropic support until resolution of the acute inducing factors or the patient receives more definitive treatment, such as coronary revascularization, mechanical circulatory support, or heart transplant. Short-term intravenous inotropic support should be given to patients in cardiogenic shock to preserve systemic blood flow and protect from end-organ damage. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of dobutamine, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in treating patients with cardiac disorders that will respond to such therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various indications for dobutamine.
- Outline the adverse event profile for dobutamine.
- Review the mechanism of action of dobutamine that leads to its therapeutic effects.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance diabetes management and improve outcomes by using dobutamine.
