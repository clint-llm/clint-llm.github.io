Testing for low FXIII levels can be warranted when general hematology labs show no abnormality of PT, PTT, INR and bleeding time in the presence of hemorrhage, hematomas and/or delayed bleeding. These findings would indicate more of a workup for a defect in clot stabilization or fibrinolysis, particularly after trauma or surgical procedures.

First line detection of Factor XIII activity is obtainable by ammonia release assay, or a quantitative functional factor XIII assay.
