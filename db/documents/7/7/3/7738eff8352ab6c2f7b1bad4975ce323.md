Management of the acute scrotum is a surgical emergency until proven otherwise. As patients with this condition usually present to the emergency department, the first person to encounter the patient is a triage nurse who must be cognizant of the urgency potential testicular torsion demands and immediately contact the clinical interprofessional team. The patient should be placed in a room promptly, and the clinician alerted of the patient's presence and chief complaint. Early history and physical exam should give the clinician some guidance and direction, usually necessitating a color Doppler ultrasound to be promptly read by a radiologist.

Once testicular torsion can safely be ruled out, other potential causes of acute scrotal pain, including testicular appendage torsion, can come under consideration and the patient can be appropriately treated.

Management of pre-pubescent scrotal pain requires a coordinated interprofessional effort between clinicians, specialists, and nursing staff to lead to accurate and prompt diagnosis resulting in appropriately directed treatment. [Level 5]
