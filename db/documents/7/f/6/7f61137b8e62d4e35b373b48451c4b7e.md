Post intubation laryngeal edema is common after endotracheal intubation and clinically manifests after extubation. Though most cases of post-intubation laryngeal edema are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, it is a significant contributor to the development of post-extubation stridor. Almost half of the patients with post-extubation stridor get reintubated. Reintubation event increases the risk of morbidity and mortality of the patients. It is of paramount importance to identify and manage the patients at high risk for post-intubation (extubation) laryngeal edema and stridor, thereby preventing their progression into worsening respiratory failure requiring a reintubation. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in clinical evaluation and management of post-intubation laryngeal edema.

**Objectives:**
- Summarise the etiology of post-intubation laryngeal edema.
- Summarize the evaluation of post-intubation laryngeal edema.
- Review the management options available for post-intubation laryngeal edema.
