**Contact Lens Fitting Strategies in Presbyopia**

The presbyopic contact lenses must be disposable lenses. The trial period of the lenses must be extended and realistic and should be based on patient feedback. The trial lens power must be close to the required power. The manufacturer fitting suggestions should be followed during the trial period. The tinted lenses assist in handling. The near, intermediate, and distant visual performance should be reconciled with the patient's needs.
