CAR-T-related toxicity occurs with varying frequency depending on factors discussed later. CRS is the most common type of toxicity associated with CAR-T therapy, followed by ICANS.

**Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)**

CRS is considered a predominantly reversible complication of CAR-T therapy, with an incidence of occurrence in 42 to 100% of the patients. It presents with varying severity, with 0 to 46% of patients exhibiting features of severe CRS and from 0 to 9.1% of cases progressing to fatal outcomes.

**Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS)**

Similar to CRS, ICANS presents in most patients after CAR-T infusions as a reversible complication. It occurs less frequently and is often delayed compared to CRS, with the incidence ranging between 3 and 64% and 0 to 54% of cases exhibiting signs of severe illness.
