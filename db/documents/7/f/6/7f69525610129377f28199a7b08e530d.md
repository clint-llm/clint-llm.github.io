Pancytopenia can occur due to myelophthistic syndrome, a pathologic process that replaces normal bone marrow. Etiologies are solid tumor metastases (ex. lung, breast, and prostate malignancies), lymphoid or myeloid neoplasms (ex. acute myelogenous leukemia), myelofibrosis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, osteopetrosis, or Gaucher disease. The bone marrow biopsy will not be hypocellular and reflect the underlying disease.

Isolated failure of single hematopoietic lineage is common (ex. agranulocytosis, pure red cell aplasia). These share the same causes for aplastic anemia (ex. propylthiouracil and agranulocytosis, thymoma and pure red cell aplasia). Patients will have symptoms related to the cell line involved, not all three.
