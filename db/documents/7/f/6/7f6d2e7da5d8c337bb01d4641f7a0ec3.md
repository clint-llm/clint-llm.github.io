Clinical manifestations of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) may occur days or even years after GBCAs exposure but usually present within 2-10 weeks.

Many patients with NSF have calcium-related pathology. Traumatic calcinosis cutis has been observed in dialysis patients with NSF. Osseous metaplasia in the background of NSF has also been noted.

Patients may have tightening or thickening of the skin. Stiffening of hands and contractures can occur. Patients may also report that their skin looks shinier. This condition may develop slowly. In many patients, some prominent features can be pain or pruritus causing a great deal of distress to them. In some reports, dialysis-related NSF has been observed to involve skeletal muscle.

Further progression of the disease leads to thickened and hyperpigmented skin (as shown in the image). The disease may involve both the lower and upper extremities, progresses from the distal extremity to the proximal one, and always spares the face. The skin is shiny and hard to the touch. A woody consistency is typical. Papules and subcutaneous nodules can also be seen. The skin can have a peau d'orange appearance, and plaques may have an amoeboid advancing edge. Joint involvement usually results in disability and contractures. Yellow scleral plaques have been reported. The fibrosis may also involve the renal tubules, lungs, dura mater, ocular sclera, and skeletal and cardiac muscles.
