To date, there are no proven treatments that cure nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Restoration of renal function, if feasible, is essential to prevent further progression as it appears to slow or hold the progression.

New research documented that using steroids and methotrexate combined with ultraviolet A (UV-A) phototherapy may relieve cutaneous symptoms. UV-A phototherapy can decrease skin induration by suppressing the production of procollagen and TGF-β1.

Narcotic analgesics may be required to control pain secondary to contractures.

In 2005, photodynamic therapy was reported by Schmook et al as a successful treatment option for NSF.
