Medial medullary syndrome is caused by a lesion in the medial part of the medulla, which is due to an infraction of vertebral arteries and/or paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery. So, medial medullary structures, including the lateral corticospinal tract, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nerve, are commonly damaged in medial medullary syndrome.

The lateral corticospinal tract controls the voluntary movement of contralateral limbs of the body. The medial lemniscus receives sensory (vibration, fine touch, and proprioception) input from the contralateral nucleus cuneatus or nucleus gracilis and sends this signal to the sensory cortex of the brain.****Due to the involvement of the caudal medulla, hypoglossal nerve (twelfth cranial nerve) damage may occur. The hypoglossal nerve supplies the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue except for palatoglossus.

The function of each muscle supplied by the hypoglossal nerve are described below:

- Genioglossus- Protrude the tongue forward from the root

- Hyoglossus- Retracts and depresses the tongue

- Styloglossus- Draws the tongue upward

- Intrinsic muscles (transversus, verticalis, superior/inferior longitudinalis)- By curving, shortening, narrowing the tongue, they change the shape of the tongue.
