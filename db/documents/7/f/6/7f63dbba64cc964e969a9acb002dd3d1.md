Gastrulation occurs during week 3 of human development. The process of gastrulation generates the three primary germ layers ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. Gastrulation primes the system for organogenesis and is one of the most critical steps of development.

The endoderm is the innermost layer, which gives rise to the gastrointestinal tract, the lining of the gut, the liver, the pancreas, and portions of the lungs and glandular tissues. The mesoderm gives rise to the musculoskeletal system, including its connective tissue, the non-epidermal portions of the integumentary system, the circulatory system, the kidney, and the internal sex organs. The ectoderm is the outer layer of the embryo, which gives rise to the external ectoderm (epidermis, hair, nails) and the neuroectoderm (neural crest and neural tube), along with the lens of the eyes and the inner ear.

Another important function of gastrulation is to establish directionality within the developing embryo. Cranial/caudal directionality is established by the placement of the prechordal plate and the path of the primitive groove. The layering of the epiblast and hypoblast establishes the dorsal/ventral axis.
