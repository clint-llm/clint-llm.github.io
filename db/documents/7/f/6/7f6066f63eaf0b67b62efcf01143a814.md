Evaluation of patients with suspected Cowden disease consists of various tests. A skin biopsy can be very useful if skin lesions such as tricholemmomas or sclerotic fibromas are present. A complete blood count, thyroid function test, stool for occult blood, imaging, or urinalysis can be very useful for identifying possible malignancies. The International Cowden Syndrome Consortium has established diagnostic criteria.

**Major Criteria**

Patients need to have two major criteria to be diagnosed with Cowden disease. (*One of the two must be either Lhermitte-Duclos disease or macrocephaly.)

- Lhermitte-Duclos disease*

- Thyroid carcinoma

- Macrocephaly*

- Breast cancer

**Minor Criteria**

Patients with one major and three of the following minor criteria or four minor criteria may be diagnosed with Cowden disease.

- Genitourinary tumors or malformations

- Lipomas

- Fibromas

- Mental retardation

- Fibrocystic disease of the breast

- Gastrointestinal hamartomas,

- Other thyroid lesions such as goiter

Mucocutaneous lesions or palmoplantar keratosis can meet the criteria alone if 6 or more are present.
