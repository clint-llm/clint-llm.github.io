The classic presentation of a TOA includes abdominal pain, pelvic mass on examination, fever, and leukocytosis. However, Landers and Sweet (1983) found that 35% of women with a TOA were afebrile and 23% had a normal white blood cell count.. Thus, if clinical concern exists for this disease, a prompt diagnostic evaluation must be undertaken.

A complete physical examination, including a thorough pelvic exam, must be performed. The speculum and bimanual exam should assess the consistency, size, and mobility of the uterus and both adnexa.
