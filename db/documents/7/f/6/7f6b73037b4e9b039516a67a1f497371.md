**Diagnosis and Work Up**

Diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess is usually made clinically by any of the following features:

- Unilateral swelling of the peritonsillar area

- Non-resolving acute tonsillitis with persistent unilateral tonsillar enlargement

- A bulge on the unilateral soft palate with anterior displacement of the ipsilateral tonsil

**Laboratory Investigations**

- Complete blood count (CBC) and electrolytes

- Heterophile antibody test (to rule out suspicion of infectious mononucleosis)

- Pus culture sensitivity from needle aspirate of the abscess

- C-reactive protein blood culture might be required in patients presenting with features of sepsis

**Radiological Investigations**

- X-ray of the soft tissue of the neck

- Contrast-enhanced CT is required in a very young patient where clinical diagnosis or in cases with other complications like the development of parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal abscess is not feasible.

- Intraoral ultrasonography is a simple, non-invasive imaging modality proposed to differentiate peritonsillitis from a peritonsillar abscess. Another important use is in the exact localization of site for abscess drainage.
