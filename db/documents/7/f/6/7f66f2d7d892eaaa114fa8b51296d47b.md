The treatment of cyclothymia rests upon managing risk factors, recognizing early symptoms, and implementing appropriate interventions, including psychoeducation, pharmacotherapy, and counseling. The primary target of the aforementioned therapies should be focused on the pervasive underlying affective dysregulation. Psychoeducation is paramount and emphasizes the necessity of medication compliance, confidence in the doctor, acknowledging the interpersonal consequences of the maladaptive behavior patterns, and acceptance of the illness. To date, there are no approved FDA-recommended psychotropic medications for the treatment of cyclothymic disorder. In spite of this, there still remain viable alternatives in the management of this disorder. First-line psychotropic treatment of cyclothymia is the administration of a mood stabilizer--valproate if anxiety is dominant, lamotrigine if the anxious-depressive polarity is more prominent, and lithium for significant affective intensity. Some patients may benefit from the dual therapy of both lithium and lamotrigine.
