Symptoms of avascular necrosis of the femoral head overlap with other etiologies that are important to include in a differential diagnosis. One is bone marrow edema syndrome (BMES), aka transient osteoporosis, that usually occurs as a reactive response to an injury, increases in physical activity, or to osteoarthritis. This condition presents as rapid-onset, sometimes atraumatic, hip pain that is self-limited and typically resolves within one year. MRI is usually significant for widespread bone marrow edema, which gives the disease its eponymous title.

Problems to consider in the differential include the following:

- Complex regional pain syndrome

- Inflammatory synovitis

- Neoplastic bone conditions

- Osteomyelitis

- Osteoarthritis

- Osteoporosis

- Soft tissue trauma
