Different theories have been postulated regarding the etiology of floppy eyelid syndrome. Culbertson and Ostler hypothesized that the loss of tarsal elasticity combined with nocturnal lagophthalmos resulted in a spontaneous eversion of the upper eyelid overnight. Parunovic suggested that mechanical stress may cause the upregulation of elastolytic enzymes and cause elastic fiber degradation and subsequent tarsal laxity.

Meanwhile, Schwartz et al. theorized that a poor interface between the loose eyelids and the epi-bulbar surface could cause injury to the eyelid and laxity. Lastly, multiple studies have suggested that elastin is the main culprit in FES. Histopathologic studies have shown that not only is there a decrease in the amount of elastin in the tarsal plate, but the elastin fibers are also abnormal in these patients. The features of abnormal elastin have been documented in human connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and more.
