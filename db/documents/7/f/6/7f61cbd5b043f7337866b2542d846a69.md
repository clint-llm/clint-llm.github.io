Inherited bone marrow failure is a spectrum of conditions in which the body cannot make blood cells responsible for infection control, injury repair, and oxygen transport. The diseases run in families but may occur de novo. Patients may also have abnormalities in other organs such as their skeleton and present early in life. Diagnose via history, physical exam, and laboratory testing. Treatment includes bone marrow transplants and additional medications that suppress the immune system and provide blood products to the body. Complications are bleeding, cancers or infections. Inform physicians of any changes.
