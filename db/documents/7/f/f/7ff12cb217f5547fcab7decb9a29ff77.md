The presentation of myotonia can result from a diverse array of etiologies. The most common myotonic disorder is myotonic dystrophy type 1, resulting from a trinucleotide repeat on theÂ dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene that has varying protein consequences depending on the length of the repeat. The next most common disorders are the myotonic channelopathies, led by myotonia congenita in prevalence, which results from defects in electrolyte channels that cause resulting skeletal muscle overexcitability.

**1. Dystrophic Myotonias**

- Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (CTG trinucleotide repeat on DMPK gene)

- Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (CCTG tetranucleotide repeat on CNBP gene)

**2. Non-dystrophic Myotonias**

- Myotonia congenita (CLCN1 gene, chloride channelopathy)

- Paramyotonia congenita (SCN4A gene, sodium channelopathy)

- Sodium channel myotonias (SCN4A gene, sodium channelopathy)

**3. Periodic Paralyses**

- Hypokalemic periodic paralysis type 1 (CACNA1S gene, calcium channelopathy)

- Hypokalemic periodic paralysis type 2 (SCN4A gene, sodium channelopathy)

- Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (SCN4A gene, sodium channelopathy)

- Andersen-Tawil syndrome (KCNJ2 gene, potassium rectifying channelopathy)
