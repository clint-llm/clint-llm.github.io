Young fit athletes who develop symptoms of dyspnea, angina, syncope, and palpitations should go to a healthcare provider promptly for evaluation to prevent adverse outcomes like sudden cardiac death.Â Those with coronary artery anomalies should consult with an interprofessional team including interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, and congenital heart specialist for best options for evaluation and treatment. Avoid strenuous activity until correction of the anomaly is performed.
