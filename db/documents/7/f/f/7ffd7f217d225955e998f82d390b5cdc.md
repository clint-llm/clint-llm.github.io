Complications from primary polydipsia result from hyponatremia. Symptoms or presentations include nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, tremors, dizziness, ataxia, confusion, lethargy, and, most commonly, seizures. Care should be taken to prevent the rapid correction of sodium level in a patient with hyponatremia to avoid central pontine myelinolysis. Sodium should not be corrected more than 8-10 mmol/l in 24 hours. Water, along with dextrose, can be infused if there is an overcorrection.Â Central pontine myelinolysis can result in permanent severe neurological damage. Hyponatremia can result in death as well.
