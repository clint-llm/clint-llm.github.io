The iatrogenic pelvic inflammatory disease has been documented after a patient underwent an office hymenotomy under sterile conditions. The surgical site had spontaneously sealed within one day when the patient was evaluated by an adolescent gynecologist who scheduled a hymenectomy in the operating room two days later. However, on postoperative day 7, the patient had a high-grade fever and had lower abdominal pain with MRI demonstrating right pyosalpinx requiring CT-guided drainage. This account illustrates that even small incisions into an imperforate hymen for symptomatic relief or confirmation of diagnosis should not be undertaken due to the risk of iatrogenic infection from the inoculation of bacteria into the hematocolpos.

Hymen re-closure is a risk, thought to be increased in prepubertal patients due to a lack of estrogenization of genital tissue.

Another case report of a 16-year-old girl who required four hymen surgeries due to re-closure had a Foley catheter placed for 3Â to 4 days after the first three surgeries and, on her fourth presentation, underwent hymenectomy with continuous locked sutures and catheter placement for 14 days. No estrogen cream use was documented.

Postoperative infection risk is not globally studied, but individual case reports and series report their own outcomes. The decision to administer pre-operative antibiotics is surgeon-specific and depends on patient factors, such as concern for possible pyosalpinx.
