Surgery within the nasal cavity typically involves the turbinates for one of two reasons: either the turbinates are the targets, or they serve as landmarks for the dissection. The middle and superior turbinates represent important waypoints during endoscopic sinus surgery. The middle meatus houses the outflow tracts of the anterior ethmoid, maxillary, and frontal sinuses. The ethmoid bulla contains many of the anterior ethmoid cells and the uncinate cells process under which lies the lacrimal sac. The middle turbinate, therefore, serves to guide the surgeon planning to access any of these structures. Additionally, the basal lamella of the middle turbinate divides the anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses and itself serves as a milestone on the path to the sphenoid sinus. The sphenoid sinus can be accessed via a number of different approaches, but the superior turbinate represents a major landmark for locating the sphenoid ostium, which uniformly lies medial to the superior turbinate.

Removal of all or part of the inferior turbinate is common, however, because of its role in nasal obstruction. Inferior turbinate hypertrophy in the setting of allergic rhinitis is often managed with intranasal steroid and antihistamine sprays, but when medical management provides insufficient symptomatic relief, surgical reduction of the inferior turbinates is necessary, particularly in cases of compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy, which occurs in the setting of a deviated nasal septum. In many patients, when the nasal septum deviates significantly to one side, the inferior turbinate on the concave side of the deviation will hypertrophy markedly to provide airflow regulation through that side of the nasal passage. In these cases, not only is the soft tissue engorged with blood, but the bone itself gains significant volume.

Turbinoplasty, as the procedure to reduce the size of the turbinates is known, may be performed using many methods, ranging from lateralizing the turbinates by outfracturing them to removing them partially or in their entirety. Most surgeons currently perform some combination of debulking and outfracturing either under local or general anesthesia when combined with septoplasty and/or rhinoplasty. An effective turbinoplasty in the correct surgical candidate should improve the patient's nasal obstruction symptom evaluation score by 35 to 40 points on a 100 point scale, substantially relieving the obstruction.

While significant damage to the turbinates should generally be avoided when possible, some patients may require frank removal of the turbinates for oncological or reconstructive purposes. Common indications for resection of turbinates are the development of Schneiderian papillomas, specifically inverted papillomas, which often arise on the middle turbinates and require resection to prevent recurrence or malignant degeneration into squamous cell carcinoma. In cases of other sinonasal or orofacial malignancies, partial or total maxillectomy may be necessary, and these procedures will often also involve resection of one or more turbinates. Lastly, the turbinates themselves may be used as part of a reconstructive effort. The inferior turbinates are commonly used as regional flaps, based on the blood supply at the anterior face of the turbinate arising from the anterior lateral nasal and anterior ethmoidal arteries, and they are very effective for providing mucosal resurfacing during total or subtotal nasal reconstruction or for repairing large septal perforations.
