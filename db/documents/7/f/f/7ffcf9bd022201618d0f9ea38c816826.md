Orbital development begins in the third week of embryonic life. The optic pits appear first as an invagination of the diencephalon,Â eventually forming the orbit after contributions from many embryonic cell populations. The cranial neural crest cells are thought to be the fundamental cells of orbital embryogenesis, but the complex interactions between these cells have not been fully elucidated.
