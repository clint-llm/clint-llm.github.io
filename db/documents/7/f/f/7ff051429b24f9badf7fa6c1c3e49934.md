Alteplase (tPA) is a powerful thrombolytic agent used in the lysis of acute thromboembolism. FDA-approved indications for alteplase include pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI), ischemic stroke when given within 3 hours of the start of symptoms, and re-establishment of patency in occluded intravenous (IV) catheters. There are also off-label indications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of tPA therapy with agents like alteplase, so providers can direct patient therapy where they are indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for initiating therapy with a tPA agent such as alteplase. 
- Review the mechanism of action of tissue plasminogen activators such as alteplase. 
- Summarize the contraindications and adverse event profile of tPA medications such as alteplase.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use tPA agents like alteplase to improve patient outcomes in the varied scenarios where it can be effective.
