Epispadias is a rare urogenital malformation characterized by the failure of the urethral tube to tubularize on the dorsal aspect. Unlike in hypospadias, where the meatus is on the ventral aspect, children with epispadias have a wide-open urethral plate on the dorsum. It is commonly seen as a component in the spectrum of bladder exstrophy-epispadias-complex (BEEC). Isolated epispadias constitutes less than 10 percent of the total cases of epispadias.

Males have characteristic anatomic abnormalities, including a short-stubby phallus with a dorsally located meatus, upward-pointing phallus, and ventral hooding of the prepuce. Female epispadias is even rarer with an incidence ranging from at least 1 in 160,000 to 1 in 480,000 live births.
