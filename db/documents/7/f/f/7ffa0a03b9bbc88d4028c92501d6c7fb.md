EEG, similar to other tests, has its technical limitations. It relies heavily on skilled lab technicians for acquiring high-quality study with prompt artifact resolution. It also requires a well trained and experienced interpreter to minimize any chance of overcalling a normal phenomenon. The following are some abnormalities that pertain to those cortical rhythms. It is never acceptable for the PBR to drop below the normal range (i.e., less than 8 Hz),
