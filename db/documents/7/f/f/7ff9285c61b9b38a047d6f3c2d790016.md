A growing body of literature shows the positive impact that SPs have on the education of healthcare providers. The use of simulation enhanced by incorporating an SP supports adult learning theory, especially the principle of self-efficacy of motivation.

While many nursing and medical schools implement SPs into their curricular activities, associated costs of training and managing them can be prohibitive in some instances. As a result, other methodologies come under scrutiny; however, learner outcomes get enhanced when utilizing SPs.

SPs can be implemented in hybrid simulations. For example, an SP can play the family member of a mannequin, either adult or pediatric/neonatal. Wearable technology can also be donned by an SP to simulate abnormal findings; tabs that link SPs to software with abnormal ultrasound pathology or heart and lungs sounds that can indicate murmurs, crackles, or dysrhythmias.

Some SPs have the training to serve as models for procedures such as genitourinary exams and ultrasounds. These particular exams often pay more due to their invasive nature. Programs that utilize SPs for these psychomotor skills attribution should have policies and procedures in place should abnormal findings be discovered.  A faculty member should screen these SPs before a learner’s examination ensures that nothing abnormal is found incidentally by a learner. Any anatomical differences noted do not detract from learning.

**The Future**

There is the possibility that virtual SPs may become more prevalent over time; this is a trend that is continuing to receive coverage in the literature. Several studies have documented no significant difference between real and virtual SP encounters, especially those dealing with the assessment of communication skills.
