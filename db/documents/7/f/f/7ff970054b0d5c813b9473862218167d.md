**Patient Preparation**

Anesthesia

Topical anesthesia is administered, with 2% lidocaine jelly inserted into the anal canal at least 10 minutes before insertion of the anoscope. If necessary, intravenous (IV) medications such as opiates (eg, morphine sulfate) or benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam) may be administered for analgesia and light sedation.  In some situations, it may be reasonable to consider IV sedation with agents such as fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, ketamine, or etomidate.

Positioning

- The patient can be placed in multiple positions to facilitate the procedure. The most commonly adopted position is the lateral decubitus position with the contralateral leg flexed at the knee and the hip. The patient can also be placed in the knee-shoulder position or the prone position.
