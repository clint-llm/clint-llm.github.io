HSV-1 virus commonly causes Herpes simplex ophthalmicus. Rarely HSV-2 infection can occur in neonates from maternal infected genitalia during birth. Primary infection generally occurs through the oropharyngeal mucosa on exposure to secretions of an individual shedding HSV. At the primary site, the virus enters the epithelial cell, replicates, and transports retrogradely through neurons to the dorsal root ganglia of the Trigeminal nerve where it stays latent.

HSV infections incite an inconsistent antibody production, which offers only partial protection to recurrences or reinfections. Recurrent viral replication destroys sensory ganglion cells leading to corneal hypesthesia. Corneal hypesthesia or decreased corneal sensation is a hallmark of HSV keratitis. Rong et al. have shown that the cornea is capable of extraneuronal viral latency and later reactivation.

**Classification of Herpes Implex Ophthalmicus**

- Primary infection:

- Ophthalmia neonatorum
- Blepharoconjunctivitis (children, adults)

- Recurrent infection:

- Blepharoconjunctivitis (adults)
- Herpetic keratitis
- Marginal keratitis
- Necrotizing stromal keratitis
- Metaherpetic keratitis
- Immune-mediated: endotheliitis and keratouveitis.
- Acute retinal necrosis

- Miscellaneous associations: episcleritis, scleritis, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, erythema multiforme major, ICE syndrome, Possner-Schlossman syndrome, Fuch heterochromic iridocyclitis.
