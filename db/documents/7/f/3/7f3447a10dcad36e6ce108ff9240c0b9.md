The prevalence of myofascial pain syndrome in the United States is about 9 million, and it is estimated that the same percentage of patients is found in Canada. Myofascial pain syndrome affects men and women equally, while it is more prevalent in people greater than 6o years of age. There is no convincing data to suggest a relationship between myofascial pain and ethnicity or geographical location.
