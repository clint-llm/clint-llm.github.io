Chronic granulomatous diseases (CGD) are a group of recurrent life-threatening infections due to a hereditary defect in forming reactive oxygen species. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of chronic granulomatous disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the part played by defective NADPH oxidase in the pathophysiology of chronic granulomatous disease.
- Identify the common patient history associated with chronic granulomatous disease.
- Summarize the use of lifelong antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis in the management of patients affected with chronic granulomatous disease.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to decrease the chances of developing fulminant infections in those with chronic granulomatous disease.
