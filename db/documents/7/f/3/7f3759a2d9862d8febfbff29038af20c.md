As with any other component of the eye, the important contributions of neural crest, homeobox genes, and growth factors are key to the development of the accommodation reflex. While neuroectoderm contributes to the retina and optic nerve required of accommodation, it is neural crest cells that compose connective tissue of the orbit and the ciliary ganglion. The lens itself is a derivative of surface ectoderm. Unlike the structures mentioned above, the extraocular muscles are derivatives of mesodermal tissue.
