Patients with invasive lobular carcinoma present with a mass or vague, diffuse nodularity. They are also detectable by mammographic breast screening. The gross pathologic and clinical features of invasive lobular carcinoma are similar to other forms of invasive breast cancer.

Invasive lobular cancer tends to stay clinically silent and escapes detection on a mammogram or physical examination until the disease is detected at advanced stages. This is secondary to the indolent growth and to the pattern of infiltrative growth of this neoplasm, which makes early diagnosis difficult with a mammogram.

Patients in advanced stages have a palpable mass, sometimes with a slight thickening of the nipple or an exudative scab on the skin, other changes in the skin such as flushing, swelling, the probability of metastasis within the axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes. Therefore, the doctor should examine the patient very well so that nothing relevant is lost.

It is very important to note that patients with gastric symptoms and a medical history of mammary cancer, namely invasive lobular carcinoma, should undergo a regular check-up with upper digestive endoscopy to detect gastric metastases.
