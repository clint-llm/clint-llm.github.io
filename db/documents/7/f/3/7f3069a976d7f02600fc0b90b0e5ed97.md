Impairment in the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) or the potassium channel (ROMK) affect the transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TALH). This results in increased distal delivery of these ions, where only some sodium is reabsorbed, and potassium is secreted.

Types of Bartter syndrome:

- Type I results from mutations in the sodium chloride/potassium chloride cotransporter gene (NKCC2)

- Type II results from mutations in the ROMK gene

- Type III results from mutations in the chloride channel gene (CLC-Kb)

- Type IV results from the loss-of-function mutations in gene encoding barttin

- Type V results from mutations in extracellular calcium ion-sensing receptor and in the genes that encode the chloride channel subunits, ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb

Bartter syndrome can be secondary to aminoglycoside use. Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia commonly are seen with an aminoglycoside-induced Bartter-like syndrome.

An antenatal variant of Bartter syndrome presents with severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and profound systemic manifestations. Bartter syndrome III and V usually present later in life and have mild symptoms.
