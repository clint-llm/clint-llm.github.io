Cervical cancer is not a sexually transmitted infection, but it develops from precursor lesions (CIN) that are predisposed by a persistent infection with a common sexually transmitted pathogen, the HPV. There are over 200 species of human papillomavirus. Researchers have identified 13 hrHPV viral strains that cause human cancers, of which HPV 16 and HPV 18 cause about 70 percent of cervical cancers, and more so in HIV-infected women.

Other studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of hrHPV in patients with ASC-US; one study in Brazil analyzed 1,340 liquid-based cytology specimens and found out that 64% of ASC-US specimens harbored hrHPV.
