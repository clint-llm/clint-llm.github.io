Spinal cord ischemia and infarction occur less frequently than cerebral infarction but result in significant mortality, disability, and reduced quality of life in survivors. Modern imaging techniques and refined diagnostic criteria have increased awareness of spinal cord ischemia and enhanced our understanding of its pathophysiology. With prompt clinical recognition and judicious use of diagnostic tests including imaging studies, many patients can experience good functional outcomes with comprehensive clinical follow-up, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation.
