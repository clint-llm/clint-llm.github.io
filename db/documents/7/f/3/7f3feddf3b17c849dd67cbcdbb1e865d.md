Phlebotomy is a procedure that is often performed in clinical care settings. However ubiquitous the procedure may be, proper planning and execution are critical in drawing blood from the patient for its intended purpose. Whether it is for diagnosis or therapy, health care providers must work together to enhance patient outcomes.

Health care providers must be knowledgeable about the patient's medical history and any preexisting conditions. Any healthcare provider speaking with the patient, whether the nurse or the physician, should inform the patient of a blood draw occurring, explain its reasons, and answer any questions they may have to ease the patient into an often uncomfortable and frightening experience. Pharmacists should be consulted if the patient is on any blood thinners or other medications that might cause unwanted complications. For complex cases with difficult access points to veins, a certified phlebotomist should be consulted.

Health care providers should also be aware of the potential complications phlebotomy can present with and only perform when necessary. The entire healthcare team of nurses, physicians, lab technicians, and phlebotomists are equally responsible for complete sterility throughout the procedure.
