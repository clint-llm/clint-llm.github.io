The first diagnostic histopathologic criteria for OLP was proposed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Precancerous Lesions in 1978. They noted that OLP lesions might display the following microscopic features: orthokeratosis or parakeratosis, saw-tooth rete ridges, Civatte bodies, a narrow band of eosinophilic material in the basement membrane, a band-like zone of predominately lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial lamina propria and liquefaction degeneration in the basal cell layer.

It was subsequently highlighted that many of these features are not specific to OLP. As such, a recent position paper by the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology (AAOMP) proposed a new set of diagnostic histopathologic criteria in attempting to exclude several of the lichenoid mimics and to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The proposed criteria now include the following: a band-like zone of predominately lymphocytic infiltrate in the epithelium-lamina propria interface, liquefactive degeneration in the basal cell layer, lymphocytic exocytosis, and the absence of epithelial dysplasia and verrucous epithelial architectural changes.

When examined under direct immunofluorescence, samples from patients with OLP show fibrinogen deposition in a shaggy pattern along the basement membrane zone, without immunoglobulins and complements.

Since histologic findings are not specific to OLP, a detailed history taking with clinical correlation is necessary to arrive at a conclusive diagnosis.
