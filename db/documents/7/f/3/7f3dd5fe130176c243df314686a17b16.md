Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) is a complex disease process that overlaps with many other disorders.

- The physical impairments of PICS should be differentiated from other causes of weakness or neurological deficit, including stroke or disorders of the spine.

- Electrolyte, endocrine, or nutritional deficiencies giving rise to these symptoms should also be ruled out and addressed.

- While cognitive decline resulting from PICS should be differentiated from other causes of dementia, there may be overlap between the two, particularly in elderly populations. While the course of different forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer is typically progressive, cognitive impairments arising as part of PICS tend to be more stable over time. Additionally, memory deficits are usually less pronounced in PICS than in other dementia syndromes, while attention and processing speed are more significantly impacted.

- Severe depression, which may be a component of PICS, can also masquerade as cognitive decline with pronounced deficits in attention and concentration. It is essential to distinguish between the two as the former is amenable to antidepressants and psychotherapy while the latter is not.

- The mental health manifestations of PICS-f are similarly complex and may exist within the context of other life-long psychiatric diagnoses. Providers treating these patients should also entertain the possibility of organic sources of these problems and not merely ascribe them entirely to the experience of having had a loved one in intensive care.
