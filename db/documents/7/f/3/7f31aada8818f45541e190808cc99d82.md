H2 receptor antagonists are generally well-tolerated. Mild side effects may include headache, drowsiness, fatigue, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.

Drug interactions with H2 receptor antagonists may occur. As a result of the therapeutic increase in gastric pH, the absorption of drugs requiring an acidic environment for dissolution may become altered. Cimetidine is a potent cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme inhibitor and should be avoided with other medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes such as theophylline, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or warfarin. Prolonged, high doses of cimetidine have also been linked to gynecomastia, reduced sperm count, and impotence in men and galactorrhea in women. This condition typically resolves with drug discontinuation. Today, clinicians generally avoid cimetidine as a therapeutic recommendation for gastric symptoms.

Using H2 receptor antagonists on a scheduled basis may result in tachyphylaxis or tolerance, limiting their use as maintenance therapy for GERD symptoms. Tolerance to the effects of H2RAs can occur within 7 to 14 days of continued treatment. Intermittent, or as needed, H2RAs may help prevent the development of tachyphylaxis.

Compared to proton pump inhibitors, H2RAs pose a minor risk for developing bacterial overgrowth and infections.
