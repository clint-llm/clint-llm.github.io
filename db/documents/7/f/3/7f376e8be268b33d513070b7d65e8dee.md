The surgery is mostly performed under peribulbar anesthesia. A 50 to 50 mixture of lidocaine and bupivacaine, mixed with hyaluronidase, is administered to achieve excellent anesthesia and akinesia. General anesthesia can be used for young and uncooperative patients.

The patient’s head is placed with the neck slightly extended to achieve good surgical access. The skin in and around the orbit is cleaned with a 10% povidone-iodine solution. Topical 5% povidone-iodine drops are then instilled in the conjunctival sac. The skin is completely dried, and a sterile self-adhesive drape is placed.
