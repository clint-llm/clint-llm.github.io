The measurement of plasma zinc levels helps to confirm the diagnosis. A level of less than 70 microgram/L in fasting or less than 65 microgram/dL in non-fasting individuals is considered diagnostic. However, adequate care must be exercised while testing for zinc levels to obtain accurate values. The use of contaminated tubes, catheters, needles, or rubber stoppers may lead to erroneously high levels of zinc. The zinc levels may vary with the time of day, stress, or inflammation. The sample should be drawn in the morning using specially acid-washed glass bulbs or tubes. Low albumin levels may lead to a low zinc level; therefore, serum albumin also should be measured. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase, a zinc-dependent enzyme, also may be useful in some cases. In cases where the diagnosis is doubtful, histopathological examination of the affected skin may be helpful but is not diagnostic. The characteristic changes include a psoriasiform hyperplasia with necrolysis, a term used for describing cytoplasmic pallor, confluent parakeratosis, spongiosis, and focal dyskeratosis.
