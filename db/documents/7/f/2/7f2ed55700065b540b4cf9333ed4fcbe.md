Some patients on potassium citrate therapy will develop hyperkalemia, which limits their dosage. Potassium citrate therapy may also develop side effects from the treatment, including stomach upset, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Calcium phosphate stones can develop if the urine pH is consistently above 7.2. Patients with chronic renal failure are at higher risk of hyperkalemia and so should be monitored carefully. The citrate from liquid potassium citrate preparations is better and more quickly absorbed than from tablets, but some of the liquid forms have significantly more gastrointestinal side effects, and many patients object to the taste.
