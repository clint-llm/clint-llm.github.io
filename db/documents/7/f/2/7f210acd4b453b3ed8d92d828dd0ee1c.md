The lesions in tricuspid regurgitation may be categorized as primary where the intrinsic abnormalities in the tricuspid valvular apparatus are responsible or secondary where the right ventricular dilatation causes tricuspid regurgitation. Secondary disorders like tricuspid annular dilation and/or leaflet tethering in the setting of right ventricular pressure and/or volume overload are largely responsible for tricuspid regurgitation as compared to primary disorders involving the valve apparatus.

**Secondary Tricuspid Regurgitation**

In adults, tricuspid regurgitation is most commonly secondary with probable normal anatomical leaflets and chords. Dilatation of the right atrium, the right ventricle, along with dilatation of the tricuspid annulus

Conditions affecting the right ventricle that eventually cause tricuspid regurgitation include cardiomyopathies and ischemic heart diseases involving the right ventricular myocardium and tricuspid papillary muscles.

The conditions that induce pulmonary hypertension and secondary RV dilatation include the following:

- Left-sided heart failure

- Mitral stenosis or regurgitation

- Primary pulmonary disease: Cor pulmonale, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension of any cause

- Stenosis of the pulmonic valve or pulmonary artery

- Hyperthyroidism

**Primary Tricuspid Regurgitation**

In adolescents and young adults, the cause of tricuspid regurgitation is usually congenital, but in adults, conditions that directly affect the tricuspid valvular apparatus are rare.

Causes of primary TR include:

- Direct valve injury from a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead placement or removal or endomyocardial biopsy in cardiac transplant recipients

- Chest wall or deceleration injury trauma

- Infective endocarditis: Intravenous drug use, neoplasms, alcoholism, extensive burns, infected indwelling catheters, and immune deficiency causes infection of the valve. An annular abscess is common.

- Ebstein anomaly is the most common form of congenital disease affecting the tricuspid valve: The posterior and the septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve are displaced apically in the right ventricle resulting in its atrialization.

- Rheumatic valve disease is the most common cause of pure tricuspid regurgitation due to damage of the tricuspid leaflets. The valves undergo fibrous thickening without commissural fusion, fused chordae, or calcific deposits.

- Carcinoid syndrome: Isolated tricuspid regurgitation may occur. The valve leaflets adhere to the right ventricular wall owing to the fibrous plaques on the valve leaflets and the endocardium. Thus, the tricuspid cusps do not coapt appropriately during systole causing tricuspid regurgitation.

- Myxomatous degeneration associated with tricuspid valve prolapse, which occurs in as many as 40% of patients with prolapse of the mitral valve

- Connective tissue disorder, for example, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos: Pure tricuspid regurgitation is seen. It may be due to mildly dilated tricuspid annulus without floppy leaflets and floppy tricuspid valve leaflets.

- Marantic endocarditis in systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis

- Drug-induced disease: In some studies, there is an association between tricuspid regurgitation and the combined use of the anorectic drugs, fenfluramine, and phentermine. The dopamine agonist pergolide may induce tricuspid regurgitation.
