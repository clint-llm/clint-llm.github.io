Mechanical aortic valves are more prone to thromboembolic complications compared to bioprosthetic valves (1% to 2% vs 0.7%) and bleeding complications due to the requirement of long-term anticoagulation to avoid thromboembolic events e.g. stroke, acute leg ischemia, or visceral embolization. If the INR is high, the patient is at risk of bleeding complications.

Endocarditis is a known complication of prosthetic heart valves and may occur early or late. The hallmark of prosthetic valve endocarditis with mechanical aortic valves is a ring abscess, which gradually leads to a perivalvular leak and valve dehiscence. If the abscess extends inferiorly, it can cause a conduction block.

The mechanical aortic valve has a finite life span of 15 to 20 years. Hence, these patients sometimes need a second aortic valve replacement, especially if done at a younger age.

Patients with malfunctioning mechanical valves may present with dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or heart block.

Patients with acute valvular failure due to breakage of the components usually are hemodynamically unstable and need emergent replacement.
