Mesenchyme (an early mesoderm-derived connective tissue) condenses into sets of dermatomes and myotome complexes. Myotomes migrate into the developing limb buds and give rise to myoblasts. Elongation of the limb buds, along with muscle formation from myoblasts, compartmentalizes the muscles into their respective muscle groups, including the forearm flexor group containing the palmaris longus.
