Initial clinical presentation is typically due to either precocious puberty or symptoms related to fibrous dysplasia.  Females can present with vaginal bleeding and development of breast tissue. Males can present with testicular enlargement, appearance pubic and axillary hair, and increased body odor. Café-au-lait spots may be appreciated in retrospect unless they are prominent.  These spots are typically midline and described as having “coast of Maine” jagged borders.

Fibrous dysplastic lesions can present as a pathologic fracture or pain.  Lesions of the calvarium and facial bones are common and can present as painless facial asymmetry. Radiographs reveal a characteristic lesion of thinning cortex and intramedullary “ground glass.”

Symptoms of endocrinopathies are specific to the affected organ. Hyperthyroidism is common. Growth hormone and prolactin secretion present as acromegaly and disruption of normal gonadal function. Cushing syndrome is typically adrenal, presents in the neonatal period and is most commonly transient.
