An important skill to acquire in high acuity situations like pediatric resuscitation is the ability to communicate well within a team. A desire for more standard measures to evaluate communication skills has led to validated performance checklists to assist in pediatric resuscitation leadership evaluation.

Good communication skills can lead to improved teamwork in a healthcare setting. Teamwork has demonstrated to result in improved clinical performance after a simulation education intervention.

In addition to communication with interdisciplinary teams, it is equally important for a pediatrician to communicate with patients and families. Standardized patients have shown to be an effective communication teaching tool for palliative care training in pediatric critical care fellows.
