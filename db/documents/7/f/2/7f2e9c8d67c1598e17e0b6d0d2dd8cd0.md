Splenic abscesses are relatively uncommon conditions that usually result from bacteremia. The diagnosis of a splenic abscess is a clinical challenge. This entity presents with the triad of fever, left upper quadrant tenderness, and leukocytosis (this is present only in one-third of the cases). This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of splenic abscess and explains the interprofessional team's role in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the evaluation of a patient with a splenic abscess.
- Summarize the treatment options for splenic abscess.
- Describe the pathophysiology a splenic abscess.
- Explain the value of cooperation among the interprofessional team members in educating the patients on the possibility of post-splenectomy sepsis and the need for vaccination, which will improve outcomes for those with splenic abscess.
