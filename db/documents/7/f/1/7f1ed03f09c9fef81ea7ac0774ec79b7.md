There are two morphological forms of thymic hyperplasia:

**True thymic hyperplasia:**It is characterized by an increase in the size and weight of thymus due to an increase in the number of thymic epithelial cells. The normal histology of the thymic cells is preserved. This form of thymic hyperplasia is more prevalent among children and young male patients. It is not associated with autoimmune diseases. The most common presentation of this type is usually respiratory distress or peripheral blood lymphocytosis.

**Lymphofollicular****hyperplasia:**It is caused due to hyperplastic lymph follicles within the thymus. The follicles stem in the medulla and interlobular septal space that shifts the parenchyma of the thymus.
