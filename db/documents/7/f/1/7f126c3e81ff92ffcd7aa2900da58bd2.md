The highly vascular stalk of the island pedicle flap resists ischemia but is also the reason for suboptimal cosmetic outcomes. The resulting scar will likely have a raised kite-shaped appearance from epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous tissue advancing into a defect. The raised appearance of the scar is known as a “trapdoor” or “pincushion” deformity.

Additionally, as for all advancement flaps, consideration must be given to the type of tissue at the primary defect and the type of tissue being advanced. For example, advancing a hair-bearing area such as the cheek onto a non–hair-bearing site like the lateral nasal sidewall would be disfiguring for a patient.
