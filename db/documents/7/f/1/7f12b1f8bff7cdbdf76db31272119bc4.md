Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital anomaly resulting in pulmonary stenosis, an interventricular defect, biventricular aortal origin, and right ventricular hypertrophy. It is the most common cyanotic heart condition in children that have survived beyond the neonatal time period without treatment, accounting for 7 to 10 percent of congenital defects. Intervention should occur within the first year of life. This activity explains when tetralogy of Fallot should be considered on differential diagnosis and reviews the proper evaluation and management of this condition. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients and families affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**

- Describe the evaluation of tetralogy of Fallot.
- Summarize the treatment options available for tetralogy of Fallot.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of tetralogy of Fallot and improve patient outcomes.
