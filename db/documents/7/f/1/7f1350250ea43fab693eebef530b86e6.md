Chronic pelvic pain accounts for almost 10%-20% of gynecologic consultations. Out of these, nearly 40% are referred to specialists for evaluation. The diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome requires a high clinical suspicion on the clinicianâ€™s part. After diagnosis, medical or surgical management may be deemed necessary. The radiological approach for embolization is also considered. Therefore, the coordination between an interprofessional team that includes primary clinicians, gynecologists, and interventional radiologists is an important aspect of maintaining good outcomes in the management of patients with pelvic congestion syndrome.
