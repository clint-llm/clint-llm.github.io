Nocturnal cough is aÂ common and distressing symptom. It is important to identify and treat the underlying cause for appropriate management.

In the case of cigarette smoking or the use of tobacco products, patients should be encouraged to quit in order to improve their symptoms and prevent other complications. They should be educated on the importance of smoking cessation and how nocturnal cough could be caused or exacerbated by smoking.

Patients who develop a cough after the use of ACEI should be switched to another medication.

An empiric approach is needed to evaluate and effectively treat patients with chronic cough.
