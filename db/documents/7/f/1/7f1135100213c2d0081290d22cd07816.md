Patients with cancer-associated retinopathy need proper guidance and in-depth evaluation. They need to be enlightened about this condition and the various available treatment options. The patients need to understand that CAR is a potentially blinding and devastating condition, and the features of the same may develop even before the neoplasm is clinically evident. The patient must understand that although there is no standard treatment protocol for this entity, proper compliance to the treatment is needed to stall or rarely reverse this condition.
