The etiology of macroglossia is multifactorial. It can be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait and present as isolated true macroglossia or could be one of the features in inherited genetic syndromes. In true macroglossia, enlargement of the tongue occurs due to tissue overgrowth from lingual muscular hypertrophy or glandular hyperplasia, tissue infiltration, infectious or inflammatory causes. It is seen in both congenital and acquired conditions.

It can be categorized into congenital or acquired. In congenital macroglossia, the important causes include Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, Mucopolysaccharodoses (Hunter syndrome and Hurler syndrome), Down syndrome, Pompe disease, Robinow syndrome, Maroteux - Lamy syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, idiopathic muscular hypertrophy, adenoid hyperplasia, hemangioma, and lymphangioma among others.

Macroglossia seen in acquired disorders is generally due to chronic infectious or inflammatory diseases, malignancies, endocrine, and metabolic disorders. They include hypothyroidism, amyloidosis, acromegaly, cretinism, diabetes mellitus and inflammatory conditions such as syphilis, tuberculosis, glossitis, benign and malignant tumors such as lymphoma, neurofibromatosis, allergic reactions, radiation, surgery, polymyositis, head and neck infections, trauma, hemorrhage, lymphangioma, hemangioma, lipoma, venous congestion, etc.

Macroglossia is an unusual but potentially lethal postoperative complication that may follow neurosurgical procedures in the posterior cranial fossa done in the sitting position. This is attributed to compression of arteries and veins during excessive neck flexion as well as mechanical compression of the tongue by endotracheal tube or an oral airway. Complete airway obstruction may occur immediately or after 30 minutes in cases of reperfusion injury after relief of obstruction. The incidence of this complication is estimated at 1%

Macroglossia is the most frequent oral manifestation of amyloidosis and maybe the only presenting symptom of the disease. One should have a high level of suspicion for amyloidosis when a patient presents with macroglossia and tongue ulcerations.

Acromegaly is a rare endocrinologic condition due to excessive secretion of growth hormone resulting in a syndrome of coarsened facial features and overgrowth of the jaw, tongue, hands, and feet. Macroglossia is a classical finding in patients with acromegaly. Other notable features include prognathism, prominent mandible, limited mouth opening, obstructive sleep apnea, large hands and feet, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Airway obstruction due to macroglossia and hypertrophy of laryngeal/pharyngeal mucosal tissues leads to upper airway obstruction, snoring, and obstructive sleep apnea in approximately half of the patients with acromegaly and this can complicate tracheal intubation during anesthesia.

Macroglossia is a common feature in patients with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. BWS is an overgrowth disorder characterized by macroglossia, gigantism, midline abdominal wall defects, neonatal hypoglycemia, and visceromegaly. Babies and children with this syndrome are larger than normal, usually until age eight, after which growth shuts down, and they attain average height. They have features of asymmetric growth, crease, or pits in the skin near ears, among many other features. BWS falls into a clinical spectrum and that some features that are considered classical are not present in every patient, and the diagnosis should not be missed. Of children diagnosed with classical BWS, 90% have macroglossia, and BWS spectrum is the most common cause of macroglossia in childhood.

Hypothyroidism is a common cause of macroglossia in children. In hypothyroidism, along with macroglossia affected children also suffer from short stature, delayed puberty, dry skin, and brittle hair. Patients with Down syndrome present with a short neck, hypotonia, a tongue that tends to stick out more, small ears, and has distinctive facial features. The tongue may appear enlarged due to hypotonia seen with this condition.
