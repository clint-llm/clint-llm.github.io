Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia results from HPV infection within cervical cells. These changes, especially in young women, commonly revert to normal cells due to an intact immune response and rapid turnover of cells on the cervix. About 60% of CIN-1 will regress to normal after 1 year. Women with CIN-2 and CIN-3 are at high risk for developing invasive cancer, although the average time for progression is still several years. Therefore, women with CIN-2/3 should receive treatment. Exceptions to this recommendation are women in the 20 to 24 year age group and pregnant women.  Since a significant percentage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) on Pap smear will have CIN-2 or 3, it makes sense that these pap smears still require colposcopy and biopsy in most cases. The same holds for older women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) pap smears who also have a high-risk HPV. Cytology is the screening test, but histologic characteristics of a tissue biopsy make the diagnosis.
