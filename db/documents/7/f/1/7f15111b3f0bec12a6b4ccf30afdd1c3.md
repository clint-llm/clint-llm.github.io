Primary lymphedema is rare, affecting 1 in 100,000 individuals. Secondary lymphedema is the most common cause of the disease and affects approximately 1 in 1000 Americans.

The identification of the incidence and prevalence of lymphedema is complex. Lymphedema is remarkably prevalent, but the population implications of lymphatic dysfunction are not well studied. Prevalence estimates for lymphedema are relatively high, yet its prevalence is likely underestimated. There is an absence of prospectively designed and rigorously performed relevant epidemiologic studies that limit the true prevalence of the disease.

The incidence of lymphedema is most widely studied in the oncologic population. One in 5 women who survive breast cancer will develop lymphedema.
