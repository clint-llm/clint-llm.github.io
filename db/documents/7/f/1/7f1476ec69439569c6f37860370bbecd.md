A thorough history is important to elicit information regarding prior scarring and wound healing, recent isotretinoin use, history of gold salt ingestion for rheumatoid arthritis (can result in blue-grey skin discoloration, or chrysiasis in laser treatment areas), or history of infectious disease. It is also important to inquire about “double tattoos” which can lead to a greater risk of scarring with laser removal.
