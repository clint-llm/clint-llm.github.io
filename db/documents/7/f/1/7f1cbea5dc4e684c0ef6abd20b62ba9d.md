The peptic ulcer disease (PUD) mechanism results from anÂ imbalance between gastric mucosal protective and destructive factors. Risk factors predisposing to the development of PUD:

- H. pylori infection

- NSAID use

- First-degree relative with PUD

- Emigrant from a developed nation

- African American/Hispanic ethnicity

With peptic ulcers, there is usually a defect in the mucosa that extends to the muscularis mucosa. Once the protective superficial mucosal layer is damaged, the inner layers are susceptible to acidity. Further, the ability of the mucosal cells to secrete bicarbonate is compromised.

H. pylori is known to colonize the gastric mucosa and causes inflammation. The H. pylori also impairs the secretion of bicarbonate, promoting the development of acidity and gastric metaplasia.
