An auricular hematoma is a collection of blood underneath the perichondrium of the ear and typically occurs secondary to trauma. Auricular deformity, commonly known as "cauliflower ear" is the result of untreated or inadequately treated auricular hematoma. It is important to recognize and drain auricular hematomas since persistent hematomas can induce cartilage destruction with subsequent deformity of the ear. Treatment involves drainage and evacuation of the hematoma. This activity describes the evaluation and management of auricular hematomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for developing "cauliflower ear" after an auricular hematoma. 
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with auricular hematomas.
- Describe the management considerations for patients with auricular hematomas.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by auricular hematomas.
