Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Breast cancer treatment has progressively improved with advances in endocrine therapy, early detection, and breast conservation surgical techniques. However, for patients undergoing mastectomy, the concerns of a potentially disfiguring surgery after a cancer diagnosis significantly affect the patient’s treatment and overall psychosocial recovery.

The goal of the plastic surgeon, along with the patient and their breast surgeon, is to develop a plan to restore body image after successful oncologic treatment. Breast reconstruction is multifaceted, and discussing all options with the patient is crucial to provide optimal results. The use of chemoradiation, procedure choice, timing, and the entire scope of the cancer treatment must be considered before proceeding with reconstruction.
