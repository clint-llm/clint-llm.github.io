The presentation of a newborn in the postnatal period often involves the presence of a sac extending from the vertebral column, covered with meninges, filled with cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissue.

Children can exhibit delays in developmental milestones, especially in motor function. The absence of leg movements is usually a result of lower motor neuron dysfunction caudal to the lesion. However, children may show spontaneous leg movements, which is due to functional neuronal conduction. These movements can be preserved with therapeutic strategies and physiotherapy.
