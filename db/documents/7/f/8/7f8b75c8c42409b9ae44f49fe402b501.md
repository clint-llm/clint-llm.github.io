Technetium 99m sestamibi is a cationic radiotracer with FDA approval as a nuclear myocardial perfusion agent to visualize the blood flow through the heart. Also, sestamibi allows simultaneous assessment of exertional and resting left ventricular ejection fraction. Myocardial perfusion imaging using sestamibi is less invasive than coronary angiography and shows strong evidence for testing for irreversible or reversible ischemia. The American College of Cardiology recommends stress testing using myocardial perfusion imaging for patients with negative biomarkers, nondiagnostic electrocardiography, and chest pain that is not recurrent.

Another FDA-approved indication for sestamibi is in the setting of scintimammography, a complimentary second-line agent in breast imaging for breast cancer when the breasts are mammographically dense or mammography is inconclusive.

Additionally, sestamibi is frequently used in the noninvasive intraoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissues and adenomas in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Finally, a non-FDA-approved use of sestamibi is in the detection of multidrug resistance in cancer that is mediated by P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-related protein-1.
