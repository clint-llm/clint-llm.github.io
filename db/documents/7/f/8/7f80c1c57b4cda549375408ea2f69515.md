The masseter muscle primarily gets its vascular supply from the masseteric artery, a branch of the maxillary artery (formerly the internal maxillary artery). The maxillary artery comes off the external carotid artery behind the neck of the mandible. The maxillary artery divides into the mandibular, pterygoid, and pterygopalatine portions. The pterygoid portion (muscular portion, the second portion) has four main branches including the masseteric artery, pterygoid branches, deep temporal arteries, and the buccal artery. The masseteric artery is a small branch that passes through the mandibular notch of the mandible into the deep surface of the masseter muscle. The masseteric artery anastomoses with branches of the facial artery (formerly the external maxillary artery) and the transverse facial artery.
