Asthma prevalence varies significantly based on community development, region, and climate. According to the 2017 asthma data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6.2 million children (0 to 17 years) have asthma in the United States. Children aged 0 to 17 years have a higher prevalence of asthma and higher visit rates to primary care physicians and emergency departments than adults, yet lower mortality.

Bronchiolitis most frequently presents in the winter season due to the plethora of viral pathogens--the most common of which is Respiratory syncytial virus. Bronchiolitis is more common in males, non-breastfed infants, and children who have crowded living conditions. On average, over 130000 children less than two years of age are hospitalized each year for bronchiolitis in the United States, with estimated annual healthcare costs of $1.73 billion.

In developed countries, estimates are that there is a lifetime prevalence of anaphylaxis of 0.5 to 2%.
