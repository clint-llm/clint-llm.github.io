Subclavian steal syndrome is a relatively benign condition. As it is a marker of atherosclerosis, it can indicate the risk for future events like myocardial ischemia or stroke. Hence, secondary preventive measures in patients can help in a good prognosis.Â Symptomatic patients who undergo surgical intervention with angioplasty and stenting or open surgical bypass, also have a good prognosis. Most patients (over 95%) have sustained resolution of ischemic symptoms and do not require reintervention of the target vessel.
