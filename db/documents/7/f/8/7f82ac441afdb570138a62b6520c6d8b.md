Hypogammaglobulinemias may be primary or secondary and secondary causes need to be excluded prior to the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies.

Patients with secondary immunodeficiencies often produce antibodies normally even though the serum IgG is low. Hence it is important to determine the antibody titers to specific antigens before treating with IV immunoglobulins to differentiate between inadequate production vs. protein loss. High serum concentrations of 1 or more Ig classes point towards HIV infection, chronic granulomatous disease, chronic inflammation, or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.

Children with congenital immunodeficiency present with chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive secondary to malabsorption, also complicated by micronutrient deficiencies including vitamin A, E, B12, calcium, zinc, & iron.

Viral infections are handled well because of intact T-cell function with few exceptions suggesting the role of secretory IgA in host defense against viruses especially the enteroviruses and hepatitis viruses.
