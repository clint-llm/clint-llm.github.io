Priapism is defined as prolonged and sustained penile erection usually lasting more than three to four hours without the presence of a stimulus.

The body of the penis is formed of three parts: the corpora cavernosa, the corpus spongiosum, and the urethra. The penile corpora are vascular beds and sinusoidal spaces supported by smooth muscles, nerves, and capillaries. Blood is supplied from the common penile artery and cavernosal arteries which are branches of the internal pudendal artery. Venous drainage is through the superficial, intermediate, and deep venous systems which drain into the cavernous and the deep dorsal veins. The parasympathetic nerve supply to the penis is through the cavernosal nerves which arise from the pelvic ganglionic plexus. When sexual excitement occurs, the parasympathetic nerves stimulate the release of vasodilating neurotransmitters which relax the intracorporal trabecular smooth muscles which increase sinusoidal compliance resulting in substantial dilation of the arterioles and arteries. This dramatic and substantial increase in blood flow expands the corpora cavernosa until pressure and compression of the subtonic venular plexus decreases venous outflow trapping the blood at maximum capacity inside.  The venous outflow stops as the compression builds. The increased hydrostatic pressure inside the inelastic corporal space results in rigidity and a full erection.
