The post-operative rehabilitation protocol will vary based on the surgeon, but the following is a general guideline.

**Weeks 0 through 2**

- Goal – protect surgical repair of the tendon

- Weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches and knee brace locked in full extension

- The operating surgeon determines ROM allowances based on the quality of repair

**Weeks 2 through 6**

- Goal – continue protecting surgical repair of tendon, normalize gait with crutches and knee brace

- Continue weight bearing as tolerated with crutches and knee brace locked in full extension

- Begin passive ROM from 0 to 90 degrees of knee flexion, no active quadriceps extension

- The operating surgeon determines ROM allowances based on the quality of repair

**Weeks 6 through 12**

- Goal – normalize gait on a flat surface, wean crutches, the knee brace may be opened to allow flexion, begin active quadriceps contraction

- Gradual progression of weight bearing with knee flexion, avoid weight-bearing in knee flexed past 70 degrees

- Active ROM of knee

- Progressive light squat, leg press, core strengthening, and other physical therapy exercises and modalities

**Weeks 12 through****16**

- Goal – normalize gait on all surfaces without a brace, full ROM, single-leg stance with good control, and squat to 70 degrees of flexion with good control

- Begin non-impact balance and proprioceptive drills

- Continue with physical therapy exercises, quad, and core strengthening

**Weeks 16 and Longer**

- Goal – good quad control, no pain with sport or work specific movement, including impact activity

**Return to Sport Criteria**

- Dynamic neuromuscular control with multiplane activities, without pain or swelling
