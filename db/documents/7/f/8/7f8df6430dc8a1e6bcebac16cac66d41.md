Enteroglucagon was once implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes after pancreatectomy. These have also been described in a rare functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, which may be located in the pancreas itself or in the small intestine, where they correlate with slight intestinal hypertrophy. A case report exists describing trophic effects of enteroglucagon (now known to be due to GLP-2) in a patient with an endocrine tumor in the kidney.
