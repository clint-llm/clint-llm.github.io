The typical presentation of the patient with obesity hypoventilation syndrome may occur in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) with acute exacerbation of chronic hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure needing ventilatory support in the form of non-invasive or invasive positive pressure ventilation. A sleep specialist or pulmonologist may also see the patient with OHS in the outpatient setting. The typical patient is obese, with BMI over 35 kg/m^2 is considered at high riskÂ with hypersomnolence and daytime sleepiness. Other classic signs of OSA like snoring, nocturnal choking, apneas witnessed by the partner, early morning headaches, daytime fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, and dyspnea may also be reported by patients.

The physical exam may reveal an obese individual with a short and wide neck, crowded oropharynx, and low-lying uvula. Signs of right heart failure from pulmonary hypertension, including elevated jugular venous pressure, a prominent pulmonic component of the second heart sound, hepatomegaly, and lower extremity edema, may be present.
