The care and management of patients with amniotic fluid disorders rely on interprofessional communication among several providers to ensure adequate screening, diagnosis, and management of these conditions in the antepartum, partum, and postpartum periods. Obstetricians or clinically trained midwives often detect oligohydramnios during routine prenatal care visits.

Following diagnosis, it is often necessary to consult maternal-fetal medicine specialists and neonatologists who can help to develop an optimal care plan to limit the risk of complications for both the mother and the fetus. The care plans include antepartum management, the timing of delivery, and postpartum care that are each catered to the underlying etiology of oligohydramnios.
