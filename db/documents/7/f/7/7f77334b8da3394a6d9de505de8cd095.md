It has become necessary to develop medicine as a cooperative science; the clinician, the specialist, and the laboratory workers uniting for the good of the patient, each assisting in the elucidation of the problem at hand, and each dependent upon the other for support. â€“William J. Mayo, Commencement speech at Rush Medical College, 1910

Patients receive safer, higher quality care when a network of providers work as an effective healthcare team.

Simulation and classroom-based team-training can improve teamwork processes such as communication, coordination, and cooperation, and correlates with improvements in patient safety outcomes. Team training interventions are a practical approach that organizations can take to enhance team, and therefore patient, outcomes. These exercises are shown to improve cognitive and affective outcomes, teamwork processes, and performance outcomes. The most effective healthcare team training interventions were those that were reported to have included organizational changes to support the teamwork environment and the transfer of such competencies into daily practice.
