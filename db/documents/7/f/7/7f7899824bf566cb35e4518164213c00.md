Patients typically complain of irritation, itching, and burning. Symptoms are often prominent just before the patient's menstrual period. Many patients will have a history of similar symptoms, and some will have attempted over the counter treatment with topical agents or alternative therapies. On exam, the clinician will often encounter vulvar and vaginal erythema, excoriations, thick white adherent discharge, and swelling. Some patients will have little to no discharge. The provider should notÂ encounter ulcers, asymmetric swelling/masses, or foreign bodies. The degree of irritation is typically severe in patients with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Patients with infection with Candida glabrata usually have less severe symptoms. There is much overlap in the presentation of patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis versus other forms of vaginitis or cervicitis, and therefore ancillary testing, including wet mount, whiff testing, and pH testing, should be performed to make this diagnosis.
