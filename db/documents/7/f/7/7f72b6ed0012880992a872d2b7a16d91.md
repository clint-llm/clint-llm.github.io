Differential diagnosis may include other cerebral vascular malformations such as arteriovenous malformations, venous angiomas, capillary telangiectasias, dural arteriovenous fistulas, aneurysm, and vein of Galen malformations. MRI is the best study to diagnose cerebral cavernous malformations due to characteristic imaging findings, although angiography for the exclusion of other cerebrovascular pathologies under consideration may be helpful in certain clinical settings (such as spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage).
