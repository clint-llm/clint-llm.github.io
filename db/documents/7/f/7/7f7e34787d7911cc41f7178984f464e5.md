The prognosis for both male and female patients is excellent with appropriate glucocorticoid and sex hormone replacement therapy. Unlike other types of CAH, these patients very rarely have serious problems, especially without the adrenal crisis and associated morbidity related to difficulty with stress, infections, and surgery. There is no virilization, as seen in other forms of CAH, and the patient typically achieves appropriate secondary sexual characteristics with therapy. Furthermore, individuals with 17-hydroxylase deficiency do not have the risk of some cognitive impairment as those affected by the classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Potential psychosocial difficulty due to a lack of sexual maturation and ambiguous genitalia is a significant concern in the long term for patients if the condition is not identified and treated with appropriate medical or potentially surgical intervention. Additionally, fertility is a major long-term issue for these patients as, depending on the severity of the disease, they may be unable to conceive. They may require extensive reproductive health consults if they desire children. Furthermore, in the long term and with appropriate management, there is normal development and health otherwise.
