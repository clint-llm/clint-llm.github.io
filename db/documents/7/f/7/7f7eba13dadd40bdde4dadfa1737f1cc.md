Anteroposterior and lateral roentgenogram in the neutral position of the foot should be done for infants and standing views for weight-bearing children.

The metatarsals, calcaneus, tibia, and talus are usually ossified at the time of birth. The ossification of the cuboid bone occurs in the first month of life, whereas the ossification of the cuneiforms and the navicular bone usually happens around the ages of 2 and 3 years, respectively.

As most cases of congenital vertical talus are presented in the newborn period, the relationship of the ossified talus and calcaneum relative to the tibia and the relationship of the metatarsals with regard to the hindfoot becomes important while evaluating the radiographs.

Classical radiological findings are increased in talocalcaneal angle. The long axis of the talus lies vertically and looks parallel on the lateral roentgenogram with the longitudinal axis of the tibia. To establish the diagnosis of vertical talus, forced dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion, roentgenograms are required, which is also helpful in opting out of the diagnosis of calcaneovalgus and oblique talus.

On lateral views of the roentgenogram, forced dorsiflexion shows decreased tibiocalcaneal angle and malalignment of the long axis of the talus bone with respect to the navicular bone, whereas forced plantar flexion shows malalignment of the long axis of the talus with respect to the first metatarsal.
