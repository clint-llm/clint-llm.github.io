The incidence of Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH) in the United States is 35-40 cases/year/million. The incidence increases with age as CSH is found in the elderly population. It is virtually unknown in the younger population. CSH predominates in males more than females (the ratio is 4Â to 1).

The prevalence of CSH increases with age as it is 2.4% in the sixth decade and increased to 9.1% in the seventh reaching 40% in people above the age of 80-years.

The worldwide prevalence of CSH is near 30% of unexplained syncope in elderly, and 14% of nursing home residents, it is worthy to say that there is an overlap between CSH and vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and other causes of syncope, this makes a margin of error estimating the incidence rate of each condition by its own presenting as a syncope (i.e., multiple etiologies beyond syncope).

The subtypes of CSH occurrence rates are 70% cardioinhibitory, 10% vasopressor, and 20% for mixed type.
