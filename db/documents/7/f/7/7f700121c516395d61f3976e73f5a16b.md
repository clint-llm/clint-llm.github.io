The Poison Prevention Packaging Act has effectively reduced the number of deaths in children of the age of five and under. Before enacting the PPPA, unintentional deaths resulting from the consumption of pharmaceuticals and household products were among the leading causes of death in infants and young children. Once the Poison Prevention Packaging Act was successfully put into place in 1940, the accidental deaths related to unintentional poisoning in children 5 and under fell by a rate of 1.4 per million. The reduction in mortality rate among this population has been projected to be between 40-45 percent as a direct effect of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act.
