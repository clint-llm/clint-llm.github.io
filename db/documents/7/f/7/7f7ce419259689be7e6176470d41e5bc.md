Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is a rare, abnormal pathology that occurs more commonly in neonates but can be seen in adults as well. The increased air pressure within the alveoli and alveolar airspaces can disrupt the adjacent lung interstitial tissue, damaging the lung structure and causing linear and cystic spaces that can be complicated with air leaks.

PIE is a diagnosis based on imaging and histopathology.
