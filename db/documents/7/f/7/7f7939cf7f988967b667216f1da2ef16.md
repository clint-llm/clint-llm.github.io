The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 7% of the worldâ€™s population are carriers of hemoglobinopathies and about 300,000 to 400,000 babies are born every year with a severe form of these disorders. Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy is considered the most serious vision-threatening complication of sickle cell disease and is reportedly seen in 0.5% of patients with HbSS disease and about 2.5% of patients with HbSC disease. The frequency of ocular involvement in beta-thalassemia was found to be 41.3% to 85% in various studies.
