Patients with acne usually present to their primary care provider. But these clinicians should be aware that there are types of acne that are very serious and need an appropriate consult with a dermatologist. Acne conglobata is best managed by a dermatologist leading an interprofessional team that also includes nurses and pharmacists, as it requires more aggressive therapy with close follow-up.

In patients with acne conglobata, significant disfigurement is common, and the scarring often results in psychological impairment and social isolation. Many people with acne conglobata develop depression and anxiety. Once the diagnosis is made, these individuals should receive psychological counseling. The tendency is for these patients to hide the body disfigurement and skin lesions with garments, often leading to excess warmth and humidity, which worsens the skin condition. Hence, clinicians and nurses should educate the patient on skin hygiene and recommend counseling. In more severe cases, starting these patients on antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can also be helpful.
