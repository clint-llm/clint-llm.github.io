Histopathologic evaluation of cutaneous adnexal tumors, such as TE/TB, is essential when determining diagnosis and further patient management. As with many conditions, the clinicopathologic correlation of biopsy findings with patient presentation is critical when choosing the most likely diagnoses and the best next management steps.

Given that TE/TB is a frequent mimicker of BCC (both clinically and histologically), a single biopsy may not be enough in some instances. If a patient presents with more extensive or multiple skin tumors that may be concerning for BCC versus TE/TB versus other entities, obtaining several biopsies (either from the same or various tumors) may be best. Given the potential for malignant transformation of TE and TB, complete excision of benign lesions with negative margins is recommended.

Obtaining accurate diagnoses is also essential for decreasing the risk of over-treatment, either by surgical, medical, other invasive, or non-invasive means. As noted in the section on histopathology, the depth of skin lesions is essential for providers to consider. Unnecessary treatment complications are crucial to avoid, and some patients may require skin grafting after lesion excision.
