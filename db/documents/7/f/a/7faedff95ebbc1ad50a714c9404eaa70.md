If there is excessive cholesterol in the blood circulation, some of the excesses can become trapped in arterial walls, over time, this builds up and forms plaques. These plaques can narrow blood vessels and make them less flexible; this process is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis of the coronary circulation results in coronary arterial disease (CAD), and atherosclerosis of the carotid and vertebral arteries results in stroke manifestations. CAD causing ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, followed by stroke-related deaths. Together, both of these pathologies remained as the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years, accounting for 15.2 million deaths in 2016.

There is enough evidence showing that the buildup of plaque in arteries begins in early childhood and correlates to adult atherosclerotic disease. Therefore, regardless of risk factors, all children should be encouraged to follow a healthy diet and lifestyle. Hence, inculcating the habits of healthy eating early on can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease over time. All children two years and over should be encouraged to consume foods rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fish. We need to limit sugar-rich foods and drinks. Childhood obesity is another growing health menace in the current day lifestyles associated with the intake of foods high in cholesterol.
