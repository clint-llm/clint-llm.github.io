Breast cancer management is best managed in an interprofessional setting that involves the patient, nurse specialists, oncologists, radiologists, and surgeons. The patient should pursue NAC reconstruction once a stable breast reconstruction has been reached and after adjuvant therapies have been completed. The interprofessional team for NAC will include a surgeon, OR nurses, and surgical assistants. The patient's family clinician should also be kept inÂ the information loop for subsequent monitoring between post-surgical follow-ups. With this type of interprofessional coordination, patients will have a better chance at a positive outcome. [Level 5]
