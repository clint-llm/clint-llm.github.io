Congenital deformities of the fifth toe do not require routine laboratory or radiographic evaluation. X-rays may demonstrate an observed deformity, but physical examination is the most important tool in assessing such deformities. The weight-bearing radiograph reveals an increased intermetatarsal angle (>12 degrees) and metatarsophalangeal angle (>14 degrees) inÂ Bunionette Deformity.
