Alcohol misuse is a significant risk factor for groove pancreatitis.

In addition, pancreatic ductal stones can obstruct the dorsal accessory duct (Santorini duct) as it emerges into the minor papilla.

Other anatomical and functional conditions lead to altered pancreatic secretions. The anatomical conditions involve pancreatic divisum, annular pancreas, and ectopic pancreas, and the functional pathologies include duodenal wall thickening.
