Prescribers need to pay attention to the metabolism and processing of the mood-stabilizing agents as their accumulation in the body can lead to their toxicities and adverse effects.

Lithium clearance is through the kidneys. As renal function decreases with age, prescribers should exercise caution in patients over the age of 60 and those with renal failure.

Valproic acid should be avoided in pregnancy and harbors a serious adverse effect of fatal hepatotoxicity. It may also cause pancreatitis, SIADH, hyponatremia, headache, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

Lamotrigine and carbamazepine are both capable of causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome; therefore, patients should learn to monitor themselves for any skin changes or new rashes after initiation of a mood stabilizer regimen with either of these drugs.
