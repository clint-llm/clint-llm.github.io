Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries and is the underlying cause of about 50% of all deaths in westernized society. It is principally a lipid-driven process initiated by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein and remnant Â lipoprotein particles and an active inflammatory process in focal areas of arteries particularly at regions of disturbed non-laminar flow at branch points in the arteries and is considered a primary cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) resulting in heart attacks, stroke and peripheral arterial disease. In this review, we outline the vascular biology, sequelae and potential management.
