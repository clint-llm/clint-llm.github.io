The neuronal mechanism of the quadriceps muscle (including the rectus femoris muscle) movement begins at the apex of the precentral gyrus. The neuronal signal travels down the corticospinal tract, which decussates in the medullary pyramid. After decussation, the corticospinal tract continues as the lateral corticospinal tract. Once the neuronal signal reaches spinal nerve L4, upper motor neurons synapse to lower motor neurons. The neuronal signal propagates through the anterior root of L4 until it reaches the anterior rami of L4, where it exits the spinal cord by way of the lumbar plexus. The posterior division of the L4 root, also known as the femoral nerve, supplies the quadriceps muscles. The lumbar nerves L2 and L3 also contribute to the femoral nerve. Once the signal reaches the quadriceps muscle via the femoral nerve, the quadriceps muscles work together to extend the knee and flex the thigh at the hip.
