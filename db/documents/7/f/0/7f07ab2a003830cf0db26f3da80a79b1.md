Normocytic normochromic anemia is the type of anemia in which the circulating red blood cells (RBCs) are the same size (normocytic) and have a normal red color (normochromic). Most of the normochromic, normocytic anemias are a consequence of other diseases; a minority reflects a primary disorder of the blood. Management depends primarily on treating the underlying cause of anemia. This activity will focus on the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of normocytic normochromic anemia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of normocytic normochromic anemia.
- Explain the pathophysiology of normocytic normochromic anemia.
- Summarize the management of the normocytic normochromic anemia-related disease.
- Outline the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of normocytic normochromic anemia to ensure the best patient outcomes.
