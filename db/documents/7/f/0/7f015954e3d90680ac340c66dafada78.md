Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is a destructive autoimmuneÂ disease occurring in the first year after delivery in women without a history of thyroid disease prior to pregnancy. Postpartum thyroiditis could cause transient or permanent thyroid disease. Three clinical presentations have been suggested for postpartum thyroiditis are as follows: (1) transient hyperthyroidism (32% of patients), (2) transient hypothyroidism (43% of patients), and (3) transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and then recovery, which is the classic form of PPT (25% of patients). Postpartum thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease and associated with the presence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Chances of developing postpartum thyroiditis in pregnant women who have positive TPO antibodies early in pregnancy are 30% to 52%.
