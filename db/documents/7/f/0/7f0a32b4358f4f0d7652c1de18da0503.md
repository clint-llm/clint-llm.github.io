The right gastroepiploic artery (GEA) is an excellent conduit for CABG. Extensive studies have shown that this artery undergoes minimal atherosclerotic changes and does not increase surgical complications, either cardiac or abdominal. It also does not induce gastric ischemic after mobilization and has survival and patency rates comparable to the internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts. Hence the GEA graft is considered to be safe and a technically sound arterial conduit for CABG.
