The most common cause of shock post-AMI within one day to three weeks isÂ the myocardial rupture, out of which most occur in the first 3 to 5 days. They usually present as circulatory collapse or cardiogenic shock post- uncomplicated, small, first AMIs. Patients with systemic hypertension, older women, and patients with recurrent post-infarction angina are more prone to the myocardial rupture post-AMI.

Cardiogenic shock or hypovolemic shock is the presentation in traumatic myocardial rupture patients. Symptoms include dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension, cold extremities, and occasionally mental status changes. Some patients may manifest cerebral or systemic embolic events from pseudoaneurysms. As a consequence, ventriculopulmonary fistulas formation occurs, presenting as hemoptysis. Some patients present with pericarditis symptoms before the LV rupture post-AMI, such as pleuritic chest pain and friction rub. Tamponade presents with sudden onset bradycardia, clear lung fields, and distended neck veins. Kussmaul sign, muffled heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus can be observed on physical examination. Hypovolemic shock may occur and manifests as hypotension, tachycardia, cool extremities, and pallor. Friction rubs may be heard in pseudoaneurysms.
