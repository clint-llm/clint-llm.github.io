Radiation therapy is often used for local control and management of the micrometastatic disease. Radiation is administered to the craniospinal axis. To maximize the response, it should be given within four weeks after surgery. Reducing the dose of radiation to minimize the complications is associated with higher relapse rates and poor outcomes. For those who relapse, the prognosis is dismal. At this stage, additional radiation may not help.
