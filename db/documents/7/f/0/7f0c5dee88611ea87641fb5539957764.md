The use of moulage consistently appears in the literature as an aid in evaluating, diagnosing, and treating burns and dermatologic conditions.

Moulage application should work in a manner that contributes to realism. Thus accuracy and authenticity are important facets to consider when using this technique; if used incorrectly, learners can become confused as to what the real diagnosis of their simulated patient is, leading to a disintegration of the simulation scenario.

**The Future**

As technology advances, one particular method can supplement and perhaps replace moulage over time. Three-dimensional (3D) printing has become increasingly prevalent in simulation. Models, once composed of wax, are now composed of various polymers and resin. Moulage items, such as skin lesions, have successfully been printed for teaching purposes. Not only does the printed lesion look realistic, but it also feels realistic.
