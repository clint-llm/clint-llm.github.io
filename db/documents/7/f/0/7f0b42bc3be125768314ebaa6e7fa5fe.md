High-flow nasal cannula therapy is a relatively new treatment, and not everyone is familiar with the equipment. Educational sessions should be held for nurses, respiratory therapists, and other clinicians before the treatment is introduced in the hospital. A collaborative interprofessional team comprised of a respiratory therapist, the clinical or critical care nurse, and a medical provider can greatly improve patient outcomes when undergoing high-flow nasal cannula therapy. The bedside nurse can assist the medical team by monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory effort while on high-flow therapy to ensure there is no risk of impending respiratory compromise. The respiratory therapist can titrate the flow and oxygen percentage to meet the patient's needs and decrease the risk of over oxygenation or barotrauma. Communicating the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula with the medical provider or the need for a higher level of respiratory support when needed, the nurses and respiratory therapists can enhance healthcare outcomes by notification of the medical team leading to timely adjustments for the patient.
