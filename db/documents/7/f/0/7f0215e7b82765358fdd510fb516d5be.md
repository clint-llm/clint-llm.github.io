Patients with congenital aniridia should be referred to an ophthalmologist promptly. The broad scope of potential ocular complications in aniridia requires a team of ophthalmic subspecialists to provide optimal ocular care, as well as other providers, forming an interprofessional team. It has been recommended that only the best surgeons operate on the eyes of aniridic patients due to the potential complication of aniridic fibrosis syndrome.
