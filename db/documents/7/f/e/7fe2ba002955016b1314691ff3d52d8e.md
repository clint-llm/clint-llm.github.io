Hyperbilirubinemia is a condition defined as elevated serum or plasma bilirubin levels above the reference range of the laboratory, and it is due to disorders of bilirubin metabolism. Depending on the form of bilirubin present in serum, hyperbilirubinemia can be further classified as unconjugated (indirect) or conjugated (direct). Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (albumin-bound) usually results from increased production, impaired hepatic uptake, and decreased conjugation of bilirubin.
