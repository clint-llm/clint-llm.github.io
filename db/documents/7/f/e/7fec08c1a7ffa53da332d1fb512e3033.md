Most people infected with pertussis will fully recover, albeit usually after a prolonged illness of months. Infants and older adults tend to have the highest mortality and morbidity, respectively. The infant death rate is about 2% of cases and accounts for 96% of deaths related to pertussis. Older adults tend to have increased morbidity due to other chronic medical conditions, as well as an increased rate of complications, such as pneumonia.

Secondary complications like pneumonia, seizures, and encephalopathy may occur in some patients.
