The patients presenting with significant toe deformities associated with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva should be promptly identified and evaluated for the disease. As this disorder causes significant morbidity and early mortality, early identification can help prolong the survival of such patients. Once the disorder is diagnosed, the patients should avoid invasive procedures like injections or surgery, which may trigger the new bone formation. Also, proper rehabilitation for joint deformities and stiffness can help in getting the best functional outcomes.
