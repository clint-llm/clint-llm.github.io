The human body is mostly comprised of water, which is minimally compressible, thus pressure changes do not typically directly affect these portions of the body. However, the areas of the body that are air-filled (lungs, sinuses, middle ear, gas in bowels, and cavities in teeth) are the structures affected by barotrauma. Usually, these structures are usually connected to the outside world to allow for free air exchange, but if they are blocked the high-pressure air will push on tissues surrounding the low-pressure area and this can cause tissue damage when the pressure gradient exceeds the tensile strength of the tissues involved.

In the example of an undersea diver, the ambient pressure increases by 1 atm for every 10 meters (33 feet) of depth. According to Boyle’s Law, if the temperature is constant, the volume of a gas varies inversely with pressure. Boyle’s law can explain pulmonary barotrauma and AGE. The lung volume is cut in half while the pressure doubles when a diver reaches a depth of 10 meters. Divers who hold their breath as they ascend (or those with obstructive airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) can suffer an overexpansion injury and alveolar rupture. This can cause pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or AGE. AGE happens when lung tissue tears and gas bubbles enter the systemic circulation. Gas bubbles in the systemic vasculature usually lodge in small vessels, producing ischemia distal to the blockage and local activation of the inflammatory cascade. Some physiological effects of gas bubbles include protein denaturation, leukocyte activation, and endothelial damage which lead to microvascular leak and edema, hemorrhage, infarct, and cell death. Even a small amount of air (0.5 mL) can be fatal, especially if it reaches the cerebral or coronary vasculature.

Sinus or middle ear barotrauma (also known as “squeeze” injuries) can occur when a diver has sinus or nasal congestion or a nasal polyp that blocks the openings to the sinuses or the Eustachian tubes. This leads to a failure to equalize pressure. This phenomenon can also occur in teeth. It is then called barodentalgia. It is seen in aviation and diving. It occurs more commonly during ascent when flying but can occur during descent. There are several theories as to the etiology. If there are gas pockets from dental surgery, a loose crown, or bacterial degradation. In the ear, this can lead to transudate or bleeding into the middle ear and trauma to the tympanic membrane. Middle ear barotrauma may rarely be associated with inner ear barotrauma when there is a sudden pressure differential between the inner ear and the middle ear, leading to round or oval window rupture. This may result in a labyrinthine fistula or perilymph leakage. The most common scenario is when the Eustachian tube is blocked, and a person performs an “explosive” Valsalva maneuver. This “block and lock” scenario leads to no change in middle ear pressure because of the blockage but increases the perilymph pressure in the cochlea and leads to rupture of the round or oval window.

DCS (also called “the bends”) happens when divers ascend too quickly and do not take proper “decompression stops.” Dissolved inert gas (nitrogen) comes out of solution and forms bubbles in the blood and tissues (most commonly in the spine, nerves, joints, and skin). According to Henry’s Law, if the temperature is constant, the amount of gas that dissolves into liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas. When diving, the higher partial pressure causes more nitrogen to be dissolved in tissue over time, and the increased undersea pressure keeps the gas in solution. Similar to when you open a soda bottle quickly and the rapid reduction in pressure leads to bubble formation; a similar phenomenon occurs when a diver’s nitrogen comes out of solution and forms bubbles if the diver surfaces too quickly.

Nitrogen narcosis (also known as the “rapture of the deep”) occurs when the partial pressure of nitrogen exceeds that experienced breathing compressed air at 100 feet of seawater (fsw). The increased nitrogen partial pressure in nervous tissue causes signs and symptoms similar to drunkenness including, intellectual and neuromuscular impairment, anesthesia, disorientation, impaired vision, changes in behavior/personality, etc. The greater the depth, the worse the symptoms become, often leading to hallucinations and loss of consciousness when divers go deeper than 300 fsw. Divers that are hypothermic, fatigued, hypercarbic, or who recently ingested alcohol are more susceptible. Symptoms resolve rapidly on ascent to a shallower depth. Divers can build tolerance by repeated exposure.

Lastly, HPNS (also known as helium tremors) is a dysbarism that occurs below 500 fsw when a diver is breathing a helium-oxygen mixture. It’s characterized by neurological, psychological, and EEG abnormalities including tremors, somnolence, myoclonic jerking, nausea, dizziness, visual disturbances, and decreased mental performance. The exact mechanism is unclear, but it appears to be related to the compression effect of pressure on the lipid component of cell membranes of the CNS and its influences on transmembrane proteins, membrane surface receptors, and ion channels. There also appears to be a role of neurotransmitters (such as GABA, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and NMDA), anesthetic gases, neuronal calcium ions, and genetics in HPNS pathophysiology.
