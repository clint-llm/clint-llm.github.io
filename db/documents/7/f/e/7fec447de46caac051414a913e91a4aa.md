Typically, the need for open cardiac massage manifests during emergencies, and thus, health care professionals are exempted from informed consent in these situations. However, these health care professionals must pay careful attention and document the patient’s code status.

The patient is positioned in the supine position. The anesthesiologist or other intensive care providers should secure the airway and obtain adequate vascular access for fluid and pharmacologic administration. Due to the urgency, a complete aseptic technique is often omitted, or a rapid application of skin preparation (chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine) may suffice.
