The adverse effects of methohexital include respiratory depression, apnea, hiccoughs, cardiovascular depression, and laryngospasm.

It is important to note that when given in conjunction with other medications like opioids, the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of methohexital are additive. In some cases, adverse effects like restlessness, excitement, and delirium are possible. However, these are treatable with intravenous caffeine.
