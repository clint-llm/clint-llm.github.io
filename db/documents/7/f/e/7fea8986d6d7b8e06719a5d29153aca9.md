The prevalence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis seems to be increasing worldwide. The exact incidence and prevalence data of FSGS are difficult to ascertain due to significant racial and geographical differences.

Australia has reported one of the highest incidences of FSGS, attributable to increased disease recognition due to a liberal kidney biopsy policy.

In one international literature review, the annual incidence of FSGS was observed between 0.2 and 1.8/100,000 population.

**Mortality/Morbidity**

The natural history of FSGS varies greatly. It involves edema, proteinuria refractory to steroids and other immunosuppressive agents, worsening hypertension, and progressively declining renal function.
