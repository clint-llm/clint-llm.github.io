**Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**is an immune-mediated multisystem inflammatory disease that predominantly affects the synovial joints. It was first described by Alfred Baring Garrod in the year 1800. The disease can lead to inflammation, joint destruction, deformity, and disability, and may also present with extra-articular manifestations. Inflammatory arthritis involving the small joints of the hands is the most common initial presentation in rheumatoid arthritis. Hand joints commonly involved are the metacarpophalangeal joints, the proximal interphalangeal joints, and the wrist joints. In RA, the arthritis is typically bilateral and symmetrical. Other joints that can be affected in RA are the knees, ankles, elbows, shoulders, metatarsophalangeal joints, the cervical spine, and the temporomandibular joints.
