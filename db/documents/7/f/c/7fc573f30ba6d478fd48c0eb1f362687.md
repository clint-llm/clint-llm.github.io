At the onset of this pandemic, there was an urgency to mitigate this new viral illness with experimental therapies and drug repurposing. Since then, significant progress has been made in the management of COVID-19 due to the intense clinical research efforts globally that have resulted in novel therapeutics and vaccine development at an unprecedented speed. Currently, a variety of therapeutic options are available that include antiviral medications (e.g., molnupiravir, ritonavir in combination with nirmatrelvir, remdesivir), anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., bamlanivimab/etesevimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, sotrovimab, bebtelovimab), anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., dexamethasone), immunomodulators agents (e.g., baricitinib, tocilizumab) are available under EUA for the management of COVID-19.

However, not every patient with COVID-19 qualifies for treatment with any of these medications. The utility of these treatments is specific and based on the severity of the illness or certain risk factors. The clinical course of the COVID-19 illness occurs in 2 phases, an early phase when SARS-CoV-2 replication is greatest before or soon after the onset of symptoms. Antiviral medications and antibody-based treatments are likely to be more effective during this stage of viral replication. The later phase of the illness is driven by a hyperinflammatory state induced by the release of cytokines and the coagulation system's activation that induces a prothrombotic state. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, immunomodulating therapies, or a combination of these therapies may help combat this hyperinflammatory state more than antiviral therapy.

**Antiviral Agents**

- **Molnupiravir**(named after the Norse god Thor's hammer Mjölnir) is a directly acting broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent acting on the RdRp enzyme was initially developed as a possible antiviral treatment for influenza, alphaviruses including Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan equine encephalitic viruses. Based on a meta-analysis of available phase 1-3 studies, molnupiravir demonstrated a significant reduction in hospitalization and death in mild COVID-19 disease.****Results from a phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial reported that early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in at-risk unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

- **Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir******is an oral combination pill of two antiviral agents which, on an interim analysis of phase 2-3 data (reported via press release), which included 1219 patients, found that the risk of COVID-19-related hospital admission or all-cause mortality was 89% lower in the ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir group when compared to placebo when started within three days of symptom onset. Further studies are ongoing to establish the efficacy reported.

- **Remdesivir**is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that previously demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

- **Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine**were proposed as antiviral treatments for COVID-19 during the early onset of the pandemic. However, data from randomized control trials evaluating the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin in hospitalized patients did not improve the clinical status or overall mortality compared to placebo.

- **Lopinavir/ritonavir**is FDA approved combo therapy for treating HIV and was proposed as antiviral therapy against COVID-19 during the early onset of the pandemic. Data from a randomized control trial that reported no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment compared to the standard of care in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.****Lopinavir/ritonavir is currently not indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients.

- **Ivermectin**is****an FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug used worldwide to treat COVID-19 based on an in vitro study that showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

A recent study evaluating the effect of remdesivir, nirmatrelvir, and molnupiravir reported that these three antiviral drugs might have therapeutic value against the Omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5.

**Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Products**

Individuals recovering from COVID-19 develop neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and the duration of how long this immunity lasts is unclear. Nevertheless, their role as therapeutic agents in managing COVID-19 is extensively being pursued in clinical trials.

- **Convalescent plasma**therapy was evaluated during the SARS, MERS, and Ebola epidemics; however, it lacked randomized control trials to back its actual efficacy. The FDA approved convalescent plasma therapy under EUA for patients with severe life-threatening COVID-19.****Although it appeared promising, data from multiple studies evaluating the use of convalescent plasma in life-threatening COVID-19 has generated mixed results. One retrospective study based on a US national registry reported that among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, not on mechanical ventilation, there was a lower risk of death in patients who received a transfusion of convalescent plasma with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody than patients who received a transfusion of convalescent plasma with low antibody levels. Data from three small randomized control trials showed no significant differences in clinical improvement or overall mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma versus standard therapy.

- Previously, multiple monoclonal antibodies suggest B**amlanivimab/Etesevimab, Sotrovimab, Casirivimab/Imdevimab and Beptelovimab**had received FDA authorization for in the clinical management of COVID-19.  However, due to the emergence and dominance of Omicron subvariants, there are currently no monoclonal antibodies authorized to treat COVID-19.

- **Tixagevimab and Cilgavimab(AZD7442)**are potent anti-spike neutralizing monoclonal antibodies obtained from antibodies isolated from B cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that have demonstrated neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to nonoverlapping epitopes of the viral spike-protein RBD.**preexposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric population**(12 years of age and older being at least 40 kg in weight) with no current evidence of SARS-CoV-2  infection and no recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals**AND**who have moderate or severe immunocompromised due to several types of conditions and treatments**OR**are on immunosuppressive medications and may not mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination**OR**in individuals in whom COVID-19 vaccination is contraindicated due to history of severe adverse reaction to the vaccine or vaccine components.

**Immunomodulatory Agents**

- **Corticosteroids:**Severe COVID-19 is associated with inflammation-related lung injury driven by the release of cytokines characterized by an elevation in inflammatory markers. During the pandemic's early course, glucocorticoids' efficacy in patients with COVID-19 was not well described. It was a debate and uncertainty topic purely due to the lack of scientific data from large-scale randomized clinical trials. The Randomized Evaluation of the Covid-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial, which included hospitalized patients with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (n=2104) or usual care (n=4321), showed that the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality in patients who were on invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen support but not in patients who were not receiving any respiratory support.

- **Interferon-β-1a (IFN-****β-1a):**Interferons are cytokines that are essential in mounting an immune response to a viral infection, and SARS-CoV-2 suppresses its release in vitro.

- **Interleukin (IL)-1 Antagonists:**Anakinra is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that is FDA-approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Its off-label use in severe COVID-19 was assessed in a small case-control study trial based on the rationale that severe COVID-19 is driven by cytokine production, including interleukin (IL)-1β. This trial revealed that of the 52 patients who received anakinra and 44 patients who received standard of care, anakinra reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in patients with severe COVID-19.****There is no data available regarding the efficacy of interleukin-1 receptor antagonists on the three new SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7; B.1.351, and P.1). Given the insufficient data regarding this treatment based on case series only, this is not currently recommended to treat COVID-19 infection.

- **Anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies:**Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine considered the key driver of the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID-19. Targeting this cytokine with an IL-6 receptor inhibitor could slow down the process of inflammation based on case reports that showed favorable outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.****The FDA approved three different types of IL-6 receptor inhibitors for various rheumatological conditions (Tocilizumab, Sarilumab) and a rare disorder called Castleman's syndrome (siltuximab).
- **Tocilizumab**is an anti-interleukin-6 receptor alpha receptor monoclonal antibody indicated for various rheumatological diseases. The data regarding the use of this agent is mixed. A randomized control trial involving 438 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, among which 294 were randomized to receive tocilizumab and 144 to placebo, showed that tocilizumab did not translate into a significant improvement in clinical status or lower the 28-day mortality compared to placebo.
- **Sarilumab and Siltuximab**are IL-6 receptor antagonists that may potentially have a similar effect on the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID-19 as tocilizumab. Currently, no known published clinical trials support the use of siltuximab in severe COVID-19. Conversely, a 60-day randomized, double-blind placebo control multinational phase 3 trial that evaluated the clinical efficacy, mortality, and safety of sarilumab in 431 patients showed no significant improvement in clinical status or mortality rate.**(NCT04315298**).

- **Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors**
- **Baricitinib**is an oral selective inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK 2 currently indicated for moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis patients. Baricitinib was considered a potential treatment for COVID-19 based on its inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 endocytosisin vitro and on the intracellular signaling pathway of cytokines that cause the late-onset hyperinflammatory state that results in severe illness.
- **Ruxolitinib**is another oral selective inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2 indicated for myeloproliferative disorders, polycythemia vera, and steroid-resistant GVHD. Similar to baricitinib, it has been hypothesized to have an inhibitory effect on cytokines' intracellular signaling pathway, making it a potential treatment against COVID-19. Results from a small prospective multicenter randomized controlled phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib reported no statistical difference from the standard of care. However, most patients demonstrated significant chest CT improvement and faster recovery from lymphopenia.**(NCT04362137)**is ongoing to assess ruxolitinib's efficacy and safety in patients with severe COVID-19.
- **Tofacitinib**is another oral selective inhibitor of JAK 1 and JAK3 that is indicated for moderate to severe RA, psoriatic arthritis, and moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Given its inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cascade, it was hypothesized that its use could ameliorate the viral inflammation-mediated lung injury in patients with severe COVID-19. Results from a small randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy involving 289 patients who were randomized to receive tofacitinib or placebo showed that tofacitinib led to a lower risk of respiratory failure or death (PMID:34133856).

- **Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors,**such as**acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, and rilzabrutinib,**are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that regulate macrophage signaling and activation currently FDA-approved for some hematologic malignancies. It is proposed that macrophage activation occurs during the hyperinflammatory immune response seen in severe COVID-19. Results from a small off-label study of 19 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who received acalabrutinib highlighted the potential clinical benefit of BTK inhibition.****Clinical trials are in progress to validate the efficacy in severe COVID-19 illness.

**Management of COVID-19 Based on the Severity of Illness**

- 
**Asymptomatic or Presymptomatic Infection**

- Individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test without any clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should be advised to isolate themselves and monitor clinical symptoms.

- 
**Mild Illness**

- Based on the NIH guidelines, individuals with mild illness can be managed in the ambulatory setting with supportive care and isolation. 
- Laboratory and radiographic evaluations are routinely not indicated.
- Elderly patients and those with pre-existing conditions should be monitored closely until clinical recovery is achieved.  
- The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Covid-19 treatment guidelines panel recommends the use of**Paxlovid or Remdesivir**in order of preference****as preferred therapies for outpatients at high risk of disease progression with a low threshold to consider hospitalization for closer monitoring. The panel recommends clinical use of alternative therapies such as**Molnupiravir**ONLY if there is non-availability of preferred therapies, not feasible to use, or clinically inappropriate.
- The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends against dexamethasone in mild illness.

- 
**Moderate Illness**

- Patients with moderate COVID-19 illness should be hospitalized for close monitoring.
- Clinicians and healthcare staff should don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while interacting with or taking care of the patient. 
- All hospitalized patients should receive supportive care with isotonic fluid resuscitation if volume-depleted, and supplemental oxygen therapy must be initiated if SpO2 and be maintained no higher than 96%. Patients should be monitored by continuous pulse oximetry.
- Empirical antibacterial therapy should be started only if there is a suspicion of bacterial infection and should be discontinued as early as possible if not indicated.
- Patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing venous and thromboembolic events. Thus all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should receive thromboembolic prophylaxis with appropriate anticoagulation.
- **Remdesivir**and**dexamethasone**can be considered for hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen.
- The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Covid-19 treatment guidelines panel recommends the use of either **remdesivir alone**or**dexamethasone plus remdesivir**or**dexamethasone alone**if combination therapy (remdesivir and dexamethasone) is not available in hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen provided they are not on high flow oxygen delivery or require non-invasive ventilation or receive invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO

- 
**Severe/Critical Illness******

- Patients with severe/critical COVID-19 illness require hospitalization.
- Considering that patients with severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of prolonged critical illness and death, discussions regarding care goals, reviewing advanced directives, and identifying surrogate medical decision-makers must be made.
- All patients should be maintained on prophylactic anticoagulation, considering COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic state.
- Clinicians and other healthcare staff must wear appropriate PPE that includes gowns, gloves, N95 masks, and eye protection when performing aerosol-generating procedures on patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, such as endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, manual ventilation before intubation, physical proning of the patient or providing critical patient care such as nebulization, upper airway suctioning, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation that may potentially lead to the aerosol generation.
- Renal replacement therapy should be considered in renal failure when indicated.
- High-flow nasal cannula oxygen or non-invasive ventilation can be considered in patients who do not require intubation.
- Having awake patients self-prone while receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen can improve oxygenation if endotracheal intubation is not indicated. However, the efficacy of performing this maneuver on awake patients is not clear and more data from clinical trials is needed.
- The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel strongly recommends using **dexamethasone**in hospitalized patients who require oxygen via non-invasive or invasive ventilation. Combination therapy with**dexamethasone plus****baricitinib or tocilizumab in combination with dexamethasone alone**can also be considered.
- Impending respiratory failure should be recognized as early as possible, and a skilled operator must promptly perform endotracheal intubation to maximize first-pass success.
- Vasopressors should be started to maintain mean arterial pressure between 60 mmHg and 65 mmHg. Norepinephrine is the preferred initial vasopressor. 
- Empiric antibacterial therapy should be considered if there is a concern for a secondary bacterial infection. Antibiotic use must be reassessed daily for de-escalation, and the duration of the treatment must be evaluated for appropriateness based on the diagnosis.
- Management of COVID-19 patients with ARDS should be similar to classical ARDS management from other causes that include prone positioning as per The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for managing COVID-19.
- ECMO should be considered in patients with refractory respiratory failure.

**Prevention of COVID-19**

**Vaccination to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection**

Besides the importance of imposing public health and infection control measures to prevent or decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the key to containing this global pandemic is vaccination to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in communities across the world. Extraordinary efforts in global research during this pandemic have resulted in the development of novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at an unprecedented speed to contain this viral illness that has devastated communities worldwide and has had a downward spiraling effect on the global economy. Vaccination triggers the immune system leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. As per the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard, more than 2.4 billion doses of vaccine doses have been administered as of 22 June 2021, with approximately 22% of the world's population receiving at least one dose of the vaccine.

Vaccination triggers the immune system leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Results of an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial reported that individuals 16 years of age or older receiving a two-dose regimen of the trial vaccine **BNT162b2**(mRNA-based, BioNTech/Pfizer), when given 21 days apart, conferred 95% protection against COVID-19 with a safety profile similar to other viral vaccines.**mRNA-1273**(mRNA-based, Moderna) vaccine given 28 days apart showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing COVID-19 illness and no safety concerns were noted besides transient local and systemic reactions.

After granting an initial EUA, FDA approved the clinical use of the BNT162b2 vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in August 2021 and subsequently approved the mRNA-1273  vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in January 2022. A third vaccine, **Ad26.COV2.S**for the prevention of COVID-19 received EUA by the FDA on 27 February 2021, based on a multicenter, placebo control phase trial that showed a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine conferred 66.3% efficacy in the US in preventing COVID-19.**NVX-CoV2373,**which is an adjuvanted, recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine, demonstrated 92.6% (95% CI, 83.6 to 96.7) vaccine efficacy against any variant of concern based on results from a randomized observer-blinded placebo-controlled trial in the United States and Mexico involving more than 29,000 participants.**NVX-CoV2373**received a EUA****to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 12 years of age and older.

Interim analysis of an ongoing multicenter randomized control trial demonstrated that **ChAdOx1 nCoV-19**demonstrated clinical efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 and had an acceptable safety profile.

A third dose (booster dose) has been included in the vaccination schedule of various nations, with studies showing some amount of waning of immunity after two doses and a third dose offering higher protection levels.

- 
**Preexposure Prophylaxis(PrEP) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection**

Although vaccination is considered the most effective and crucial step to prevent this viral infection, some individuals may not develop an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination OR in individuals in whom COVID-19 vaccination is contraindicated due to a history of severe adverse reaction to the vaccine or vaccine component. In such individuals, the US Food and drug administration showed a EUA for the emergency use of this **tixagevimab**in combination with**cilgavimab**for use in preexposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric population (12 years of age and older being at least 40 kg in weight) with no current evidence of SARS-CoV-2  infection and no recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals**AND**who have moderate or severe immunocompromised due to several types of conditions and treatments**OR**are on immunosuppressive medications and may not mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination**OR**in individuals in whom COVID-19 vaccination is contraindicated due to history of severe adverse reaction to the vaccine or vaccine components.
