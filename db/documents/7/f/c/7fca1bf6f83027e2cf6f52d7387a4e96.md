Levetiracetam is a novel antiepileptic drug used to treat partial, myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. In 2000, the FDA approved the use of the oral formulation as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of focal seizures, myoclonic seizures, and primary generalized seizures. In addition, the FDA approved intravenous levetiracetam in 2006 for use in patients older than 15 years as adjunctive anticonvulsant therapy when the oral formulation is not tolerated. This activity covers levetiracetam, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, and monitoring. In addition, it highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing conditions where levetiracetam therapy is helpful.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of levetiracetam.
- Review the indications, both approved and off-label, for therapy with levetiracetam.
- Describe the adverse events with levetiracetam.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving levetiracetam.
