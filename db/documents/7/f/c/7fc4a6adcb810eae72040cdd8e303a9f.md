Putative neurotoxins include ammonia, short-chain fatty acids, mercaptans, false neurotransmitters (e.g., tyramine, octopamine, beta-phenylethanolamines), manganese, and GABA - though ammonia is the most widely recognized.

Under normal conditions, ammonia is produced by bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., breakdown product of amines, amino acids, purines, and urea) followed by metabolism and clearance by the liver. In the case of cirrhosis or advanced liver dysfunction, however, there is either a decrease in the number of functioning hepatocytes, portosystemic shunting, or both, resulting in decreased ammonia clearance and hyperammonemia.

Once ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier, it has multiple neurotoxic effects. These include alterations in molecular transport (e.g., amino acids, electrolytes, water) in astrocytes and neurons, increased synthesis of glutamine from glutamate by astrocytes, inhibition of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potential generation, impaired amino acid metabolism, and impaired energy utilization as a result of increased GABA activity.
