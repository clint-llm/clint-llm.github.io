Failure of the cervix to dilate an appropriate amount in a certain amount of time can lead to protracted or arrested labor. The definitions of what is termed protracted vs. arrested labor are listed below.

Abnormal labor patterns

- First stage

- Protracted latent phase (dilation < 6 cm)

- > 20 hours (primigravida)
- > 14 hours (multigravida)


- Protracted active phase (dilation 6+ cm)

- Dilation progresses less than 1 cm/hour


- Arrested active phase

- No cervical change for 4+ hours with adequate contractions
- No cervical change for 6+ hours with inadequate contractions

The absence of cervical change for greater than 4 hours in the presence of adequate contractions or six hours with inadequate contractions is considered an arrest of labor and may warrant clinical intervention.
