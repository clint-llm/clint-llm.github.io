Enteral nutrition is nutrition delivered using the gut. This can refer to oral, gastric, or postpyloric feeds. There are many indications requiring a feeding tube to deliver nutrition or hydration. This is known as tube feeding, enteral feeding, or gavage. Advantages of enteral nutrition over parenteral nutrition include: safety, effectiveness, decreased risk of infection, decreased cost, prevents gut atrophy, and preserving the barrier function of the gut. Enteral tube feeding is indicated in patients who cannot main adequate oral intake of food or nutrition to meet their metabolic demands. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and methodology of enteral feedings and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients requiring enteral nutrition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical importance of enteric feeding.
- Describe the equipment required for enteric feeding.
- Summarize the potential complications of enteric feeding.
- Review a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care and appropriate surveillance for patients requiring enteral nutrition.
