Cardio-selective beta-blockers can be administered either intravenously or by mouth, depending on the desired medication. The acuteness and severity of the disease symptoms affect this decision. Intravenous administration allows for the immediate onset of action and complete bioavailability, while oral administration with most beta-1 blockers allows for maximal absorption between 1 to 4 hours post-ingestion. Extended-release formulations are also available for oral use, allowing for less frequent dosing. Esmolol is a beta-1 blocker strictly administered intravenously due to its short half-life of approximately 9 minutes.

Doses of cardioselective beta-blockers may require adjustments in patients with renal disease. For example, atenolol is a hydrophilic agent primarily excreted by the kidneys. The dose needs to be reduced by one-half to three-quarters in patients with diminished renal clearance. Lipophilic beta-blockers like metoprolol do not need to be adjusted. Conversely, metoprolol is extensively metabolized by the liver. Hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. There is a prolongation of the elimination half-life of metoprolol in patients with hepatic failure.
