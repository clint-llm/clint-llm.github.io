- Parental education is useful in allaying anxiety associated with ISD, and well-informed adults can learn to be confident at managing their condition

- For ASD, it requires emphasizing to the patient that there is no cure, but it can be well controlled and managed primarily at home.

- Many of the treatments for SD are available without a prescription, over the counter at the pharmacy, or increasingly on supermarket shelves. Directing the patient to the selection of such products may save consultation time and associated costs.
