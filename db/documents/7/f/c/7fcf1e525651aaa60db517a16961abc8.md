Several muscle energy techniques address dysfunction at the OA joint, AA joint, and within the remaining cervicals.

**Occipitoatlantal Dysfunction Muscle Energy**

- Diagnose dysfunction of the OA joint (i.e., OA flexed, rotated left, side bent right (F RlSr)).

- Using one hand to hold the patient's head, place the other hand at the OA junction to monitor articulation of the joint.

- Place the patients head towards the barrier, or in opposition to the diagnosis. (i.e., If the patient is OA F RlSr,  Rotate the patient to the right, side bend to the left, and extend).

- Instruct the patient to attempt to move their head back into a neutral position and provide an isometric force for 3 to 5 seconds.

- Reposition the patient further in the direction of the barrier, and repeat step 4.

- Repeat steps 4 through 5, three to five times, and reevaluate the dysfunction.

**Atlantoaxial Dysfunction Muscle Energy**

- Diagnose dysfunction of the AA joint (i.e., AA Rotated Left (Rl)).

- Holding the head of the patient with both hands, flex the neck to lock out the joints below the level of the AA joint.

- Rotate the patient's head toward the barrier (i.e., If AA Rl, rotate the patient to the right).

- Instruct the patient to attempt to move their head back into a neutral position and provide an isometric force for 3 to 5 seconds.

- Reposition the patient further in the direction of the barrier, and repeat step 4.

- Repeat steps 4 through 5, three to five times, and reevaluate the dysfunction.

**C2-C7 Dysfunction Muscle Energy**

- Diagnose dysfunction of a vertebra (i.e., C4 Flexed, Rotated Right, Sidebent Right (C4 F RrSr)).

- While holding the patient's head with one hand, palpate the articular pillars with the other hand at the level of the dysfunctional vertebrae.

- Place the patients head towards the barrier, or in opposition to the diagnosis. (i.e., If the patient is C4 F RrSr, Rotate the patient to the left, side bend to the left, and extend).

- Instruct the patient to attempt to move their head back into a neutral position and provide an isometric force for 3-5 seconds.

- Reposition the patient further in the direction of the barrier, and repeat step 4.

- Repeat steps 4 through 5, three to five times, and reevaluate the dysfunction.
