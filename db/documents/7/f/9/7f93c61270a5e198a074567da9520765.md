Differential diagnosis of congenital corneal opacity includes **S**clerocornea,**T**rauma,**U**lcer,**M**ucopolysaccharides,**P**eters anomaly, the Congenital Hereditary**E**ndothelial Dystrophy, and corneal**D**ermoid. This can be remembered by the**STUMPED**acronym.

**Sclerocornea**

It is not a very common disorder of anterior segment dysgenesis. Sclerocornea clinically presents as peripheral or complete corneal scleralization with loss of an identifiable limbus. If the entire cornea is involved, the central cornea is relatively clearer than the periphery. A 1 to 2 mm of the peripheral cornea is vascularized.

**Tear in Descemet Membrane**

Forceps-assisted delivery leads to birth trauma and causes clouding of the cornea due to rupture of the Descemet membrane. Rupture in the Descemet membrane due to forceps causes vertical Descemet tears, whereas, in congenital glaucoma, Horizontal or circumferential Haab's striae are present.

Amniocentesis injury: This is an extremely rare condition that presents as unilateral angular or linear corneal opacity due to perforation by the needle. Along with corneal opacity, newborns may present with hyphema, corneal blood staining, raised intraocular pressure, iris and pupil deformity, and cataracts.

**Keratitis**

Infectious cause like herpes simplex keratitis and bacterial keratitis is responsible for corneal opacity in newborns. Viral keratitis often presents within two weeks of birth. It is evident as cloudy cornea with the corneal epithelial defect.

Corneal opacity is extremely rarely caused by congenital rubella. This infection is acquired in the first trimester of gestation. In rubella infection, corneal opacity occurs due to endotheliitis, raised intraocular pressure, or corneo-lenticular adhesion.

**Mucopolysaccharidosis**

It is a lysosomal storage disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Clouding of the cornea occurs in the first year of life due to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.

Other metabolic disorders like cystinosis and mucolipidosis IV are also responsible for corneal opacity in newborns.

**Mucolipidosis IV:**This condition is an extremely rare metabolic disorder that presents within a few weeks of birth. Corneal opacity and squint may be the first signs noted. Hospitalization is required due to severe psychomotor delay.

**Cystinosis:**In cystinosis patients, elongated cystine crystals are deposited in the cornea due to a high cystine level. Crystals first deposit in the peripheral part of the cornea and the anterior stroma. Crystals deposits can be seen on the iris and ciliary body. Glaucoma can occur due to the deposition of crystals in the ciliary body. Other ophthalmic findings included astigmatism and bilateral hypopigmented retinopathy.

**Congenital Hereditary Endothelial Dystrophy (CHED)**

CHED presents as diffuse corneal edema due to dysfunction of the corneal endothelium.CHED has a symmetrical thickening of the Descemet membrane in both eyes. CHED is autosomal recessive. In the 'IC3D Classification of Corneal Dystrophies—Edition 2', the so-called autosomal dominant CHED (previously called CHED1) has been reclassified under posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy.

**Dermoid**

It is a choristoma, mainly present in the epibulbar part, but sometimes it may involve the cornea and cover the visual axis.

**Congenital Glaucoma**

It can present as corneal haziness with raised intraocular pressure. Differentiating features of congenital glaucoma are buphthalmos, curvilinear Haab's striae, megalocornea, and optic disc cupping.

**Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD)**

It is an autosomal dominant disorder, usually reported in the second or third decade of life. In this disease, endothelium behaves like epithelial cells.

**Posterior Keratoconus**

It is a rare corneal abnormality presenting as a local anterior bulging of posterior corneal curvature associated with stromal thinning.
