Atypical ductalÂ hyperplasia is most often found after biopsy in the setting of calcifications found on mammography or imaging. ADH can also be found incidentally on other breast tissue that is sent to pathology for any number of reasons, including oncologic resections, plastic surgery resections, excisional biopsies, etc. There are no physical findings on the exam, such as a lump, breast discoloration, or breast distortion grossly.
