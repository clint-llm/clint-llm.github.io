The proposed mechanism for Torsades de Pointes involves inhibition of the delayed rectifier potassium current. This leads to an excess of positive ions within the cellular membrane causing a prolonged repolarization phase. If an ectopic beat is generated during this prolonged repolarization phase, known as an R on T phenomenon, this can result in Torsades de Pointes. Both congenital and drug-induced QT prolongation affect the cellular membrane in similar fashions by blocking the potassium channel. Torsades de Pointes is slightly different from ventricular fibrillation in that it can spontaneously resolve. However, Torsades de Pointes can ultimately progress into venticular fibrillation if left untreated.
