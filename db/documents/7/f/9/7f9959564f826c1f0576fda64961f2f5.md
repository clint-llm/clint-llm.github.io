Eyelashes are important anatomical structures that protect the eye by stopping the particulate matter from getting to the eye and also by diverting water and wind. Lashes also have a strong sensory innervation making them capable of detecting noxious agents with appropriate protective responses by the eyelids and the periorbital muscles. A large number of congenital and acquired diseases and conditions can affect eyelashes. It is important to identify the cause where possible and recognize how the lashes behave differently from the normal before corrective measures are undertaken. A comprehensive overview of all diseases and conditions that directly affect eyelashes is presented. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of diseases of the eyelid and the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.
