It has been found that akinesia in clinically observed parkinsonism is more commonly associated with the motor variant of frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), rather than PD related frontal degeneration. Around 30% of patients with clinically confirmed FTLD showed parkinsonian features, notably, rigidity or akinesia.

In the pediatric population, akinesia is often associated with the fetal akinetic syndrome. This is associated with high intrauterine mortality. However, the incidence in live births is 1 in 3,000 cases, with over 320 genes implicated in its pathology.
