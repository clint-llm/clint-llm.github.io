Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is one of the leading causes of glomerulonephritis and renal failure.

Recent international collaborative efforts have made important discoveries leading to a better understanding of some of the key features of the immunopathogenesis of IgA nephropathy. Furthermore, establishing multicenter networks has helped in the holistic design and execution of clinical trials providing important insights about immunotherapy in IgA nephropathy.
