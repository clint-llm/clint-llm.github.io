The pterional craniotomy, also known as a frontotemporal craniotomy, is a widely used neurosurgical approach. This approach allows access to critical intracranial spaces, including the anterior and middle fossa, suprasellar space, and cavernous sinus. The pterional approach is the standard approach for most lesions of the anterior and middle cranial fossa. Skull base tumors such as meningiomas, schwannomas, epidermoids, and surgeons commonly remove brain malignancies using the pterional approach. This approach requires some degree of frontal lobe retraction, which may result in olfactory damage because of nerve shearing or mechanical compression. Retractors used during surgery have the potential to damage the microvasculature on the dorsal surface of the olfactory nerve and should be carefully applied. Dissection near the olfactory artery and medial orbitofrontal arteries lying underneath the olfactory tract in the olfactory sulcus should be done with great care because damage to the terminal branches of these arteries may cause bleeding during surgery.
