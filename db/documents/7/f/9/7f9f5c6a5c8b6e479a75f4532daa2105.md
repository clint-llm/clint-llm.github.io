Back pain is widespread in the adult population. Some studies have shown that up to 23% of the worldâ€™s adults suffer from chronic low back pain. This population has also shown a one-year recurrence rate of 24% to 80%

However, the prevalence is much less apparent in the pediatric literature. One Scandinavian study demonstrated that the point prevalence of back pain was approximately 1% for 12-year-olds and 5% for 15-year-olds, with a cumulative incidence of 50% by age 18 for females and age 20 for males
