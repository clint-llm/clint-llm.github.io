First described in 1919 by Hess and Meyers, carotenemia is the medical terminology describing yellow-orange skin pigmentation due to high carotene levels in the blood. Excessive consumption of fruits and vegetables high in carotene content is often the culprit. Historically, carotenemia is a relatively old condition mentioned in a few old medical case reports. This condition was also reported during World War 1 and World War 2, when people mostly consumed a plant-based diet due to food shortages and famine. This activity describes the presentation of carotenemia and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of carotenemia.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with carotenemia.
- Explain the differential diagnosis of carotenemia.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by carotenemia.
