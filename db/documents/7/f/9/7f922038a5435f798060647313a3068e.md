Anti-GM1 antibodies are proposed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of MMNCB. GM1 is present in greater concentration in peripheral motor nerves as compared to the sensory nerves. Even in peripheral motor nerves, the greater concentration of GM1 is present around the nodes of Ranvier. Although the exact function of GM1 is unknown, they are considered to stabilize and cluster the ion channels around the nodes of Ranvier that are important for the propagation of action potential. The disruption of these ion-channels resulting in decreased action potential propagation manifests as conduction block and decreased conduction velocity on the electrophysiologic studies.

Anti-GM1 antibodies, although common, are not present in all cases of MMNCB. In the absence of anti-GM1 antibodies, the pathophysiology of motor nerve dysfunction is controversial. These patients may either have low undetectable titers of anti-GM1 or probably different antibodies are present that are directed against different antigens. However, the clinical characteristics are the same in MMNCB patients with or without anti-GM1 antibodies.
