Although the consequences of iodine deficiency have been recognized for years, there has not been much emphasis on the prevalence or the consequences of iodine excess. Acute iodine toxicity is rare and is often difficult to recognize. Clinical manifestations may range from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to delirium, stupor, and shock. This activity reviews the diagnosis and evaluation of iodine toxicity and explains the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of iodine toxicity.
- Review the steps for the evaluation of iodine toxicity.
- Outline the management options available for iodine toxicity.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes.
