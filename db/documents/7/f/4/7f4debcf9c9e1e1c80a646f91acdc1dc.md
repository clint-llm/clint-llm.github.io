The deposition of amyloid can lead to heart diseases in multiple ways. Direct interstitial infiltration leads to increased ventricular wall thickness, ventricular stiffness, and consequent ventricular diastolic dysfunction. In AL amyloidosis, amyloid can get deposited in arterioles leading to angina or, rarely, myocardial infarction. Amyloid infiltration in atria can lead to atrial interstitial changes, establishing a structural substrate for atrial fibrillation. Even in the absence of atrial fibrillation, atrial amyloidosis increases the risk of atrial thrombosis and thromboembolism. Light chains can also cause direct injury to the myocardial cells via reactive oxygen species.

In AL amyloidosis, amyloid fibrils are made from abnormal light chains produced by plasma cells. Transthyretin amyloidosis is caused by the deposition of oligomers and monomers produced by damage to transthyretin tetramer, either due to aging or by a mutation.
