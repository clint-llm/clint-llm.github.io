Patients with MERRF present with predominant progressive myoclonic epilepsy, a characteristic feature that separates MERRF from other mitochondrial diseases. The onset of MERRF is usually in childhood. Affected children have normal early development. Myoclonus may be intermittent or continuous. It is often photosensitive and aggravated by action and stimuli. Most of these patients also experience other types of seizures in addition to myoclonus. The seizures may be of generalized tonic-clonic, atonic or absence types.

In addition to seizures, patients with MERRF commonly develop cerebellar ataxia, sensorineural deafness, short stature, cutaneous lipomas, and a clinical myopathy that may be indistinguishable from limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and cardiomyopathy are also frequently seen. Cognitive decline and dementia also occur but late in the disease.

Clinical symptoms of MERRF are highly variable among patients, even within the same family. The degree of mitochondrial heteroplasmy (proportion of normal and abnormal mtDNA in each tissue) is one of the reasons for this variability. Occasionally, patients with MERRF also have strokes (MERRF/MELAS overlap) or progressive external ophthalmoplegia and retinopathy ( MERRF/Kearns-Sayre syndrome overlap) making it difficult to diagnose clinically.
