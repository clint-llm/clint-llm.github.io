Anatomically the duodenum is part of the gastrointestinal tract between the stomach and small intestine. It includes four segments:

- The proximal segment is known as a duodenal bulb, which connects to the liver via hepatoduodenal ligament containing the hepatic artery, the portal vein, and the common bile duct.

- The second or descending segment is surrounding the pancreatic head.

- The third segment is the horizontal part. The superior mesenteric vessels are ventral to this segment.

- The fourth segment follows the jejunum.

Duodenal perforation is a rare but lethal condition.
