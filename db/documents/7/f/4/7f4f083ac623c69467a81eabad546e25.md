Oseltamivir is appropriate for treating acute, uncomplicated influenza A or B illness in adults and pediatric patients, including neonates older than two weeks of age.

Neonates less than two weeks of age may also receive oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza, but safety and efficacy in this population have not been established.

The American academy of pediatrics guidelines recommends using oseltamivir for treating influenza in preterm infants, but it is not recommended for chemoprophylaxis for preterm infants. Consultation with a pediatric infectious disease physician is recommended in preterm infants < 28 weeks.

Oseltamivir is also useful for influenza prophylaxis within 48 hours of contact with an infected individual in adults and children greater than one year of age. Recommendations endorsing oseltamivir as the drug of choice for treatment and prophylaxis of illness caused by avian influenza strains, including the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1), come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO).

Empiric treatment with oseltamivir can shorten the duration of illness and is thus recommended for healthy individuals with symptoms suggestive of influenza, even before confirmation testing if treatment can commence within 48 hours of symptoms. Multiple national advisory bodies have endorsed the use of oseltamivir as soon as possible (ideally less than 48 hours after symptom onset) for patients hospitalized with influenza or with significant comorbidities making them at high risk for complications.

There is evidence in hospitalized patients that oseltamivir can have efficacy up to 4 to 5 days after symptoms onset. Hence, recommendations endorse ordering oseltamivir for hospitalized patients with severe or progressive influenza illness or those at high risk of developing complications, regardless of symptom onset.
