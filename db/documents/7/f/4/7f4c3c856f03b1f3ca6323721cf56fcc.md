For patients suspected of having catheter-related bloodstream infections, blood cultures are necessary before starting antibiotics. The recommendation is to draw cultures from both the peripheral vein and the catheter site for the most reliable results.

Patients suspected of having endocarditis based on a clinical picture will also require blood cultures and echocardiogram. At least three blood culture sets are recommended from separate venipuncture sites.

An echocardiogram is imperative in the diagnosis of endocarditis. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the initial step, which has a high sensitivity to 75% and specificity of about 100%.
