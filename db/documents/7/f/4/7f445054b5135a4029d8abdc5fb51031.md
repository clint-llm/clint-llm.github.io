The effects of gastrin are primarily mediated via binding of the cholecystokinin (CCKB) receptor. The CCKB receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor which, upon activation by gastrin, starts downstream signaling via the phospholipase C - diacylglycerol + inositol trisphosphate - calcium - protein kinase C cascade.

The CCKB receptor is primarily found in the central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal (GI) system but is also expressed on endothelial cells and some white blood cells (WBC). CCK receptors can also induce signaling pathways through tyrosine kinase receptors to a more limited degree and have been demonstrated in the transactivation of EGFR.
