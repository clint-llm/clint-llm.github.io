In almost all patients, the atrioventricular septal defect is caused by genetic mutations, and most of the time, it is associated with syndromes. Every six patients with Down syndrome have associated atrioventricular septal defect,Â and Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) gene has been described to be associated with an atrioventricular septal defect and other congenital heart diseases in these patients.

The other syndromes associated with the atrioventricular septal defect may include CHARGE, Ellis-van-Creveld, Smith-Lemli-Opitz, and 3p. Other than its association with syndromes, gene mutations associated with the atrioventricular septal defect can also be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Gestational diabetes and maternal obesity have also been reported to increase the risk of non-syndromic atrioventricular septal defects.
