Fortunately, complications associated with fine-needle aspiration are relatively rare. Bleeding, damage to surrounding structures, and fistula creation are all minimized by the small size of the needle. The greatest risk is for bleeding in patients that are coagulopathic for any reason. In these patients, manual compression is typically enough to stop the bleeding. The other major potential complication is to seed tissue planes with infection or neoplastic cells while passing the needle through them to reach the area to be aspirated. This is why it is essential to consider whether a fine-needle aspiration is necessary to guide treatment or whether definitive treatment should be pursued in the absence of fine-needle aspiration.
