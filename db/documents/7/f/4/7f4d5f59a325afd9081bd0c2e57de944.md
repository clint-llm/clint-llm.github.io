The IOM report published in 2015 discusses the importance of interprofessional teamwork for providing efficient and productive healthcare to patients.

The 2015 report further describes a vision of “informal education” that helps form a collaborative practice identity early on in the education continuum. Therefore, it is vital that faculty model working in interprofessional teams throughout the curriculum and especially in Sim-IPE design and implementation. This demonstration, in and of itself, is a learning opportunity for the students as part of a positive hidden curriculum. It is crucial for faculty to be mindful of this during their interactions with other members of the planning committee. Additionally, debriefing of the faculty after the event ensures continued collaboration.

Another benefit of Sim-IPE is that faculty gain insight into students’ ability to apply course material. Examinations provide limited information about the medical knowledge and critical thinking, even if they are written as higher-order questions.  Simulation provides students with the opportunity to apply knowledge in a time-sensitive matter, convey urgency in a professional setting, communicate effectively, seek input from and expertise of others, distribute workload, and function in a team.  Faculty members can use Sim-IPE as an assessment for these vital patient care skills.
