Clinical presentation can vary depending on the extent and location of the thrombus within the IVC. Typically, patients complain of leg heaviness, pain, swelling, and cramping. Symptoms can also be nonspecific, such as abdominal, flank, or back pain. Men may present with scrotal swelling. The vague nature of symptoms may delay diagnosis until clot migration to the lungs and renal veins occur, which leads to shortness of breath and oliguria, respectively. The presence of bilateral lower extremity edema and dilated superficial abdominal veins suggests the possibility of an IVC thrombus. Overall, given the ambiguous presentation, there are no pathognomonic history and physical exam findings to diagnose IVC thrombosis consistently across all patients.
