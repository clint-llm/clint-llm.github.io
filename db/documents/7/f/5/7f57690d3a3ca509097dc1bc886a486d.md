Pontine infarction treatment is akin to other types of ischemic stroke with some variability considering the lack of strong clinical evidence in posterior circulation stroke treatment compared to anterior circulation. This is especially true in patients with a large vessel occlusion, causing a pontine stroke. In general, as with any patient with ischemic stroke, immediately after identifying the subtype of stroke, treatment should be targeted to:

- Reverse the extent of ischemic penumbra tissue adjacent to the infarcted region

- Prevent complications

- Facilitate early improvement in functional status

However, this comes secondary to the initial stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Intravenous alteplase is the thrombolytic of choice for those presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and without any absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy is the procedure of choice for those with large artery occlusion presenting within 24 hours of symptoms onset.
