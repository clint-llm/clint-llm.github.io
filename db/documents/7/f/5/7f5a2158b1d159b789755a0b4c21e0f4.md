Cerebral salt wasting (CSW) is a potential cause of hyponatremia in the setting of disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebral salt wasting is characterized by hyponatremia with elevated urine sodium and hypovolemia. In the current literature, professionals debate if cerebral salt wasting is a distinct condition or a special form of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). This activity describes the cause and pathophysiology of cerebral salt wasting syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cerebral salt wasting syndrome.
- Review the history of cerebral salt wasting syndrome.
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with cerebral salt wasting syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cerebral salt wasting syndrome.
