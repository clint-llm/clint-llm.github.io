Foscarnet is an analog of pyrophosphate, a phosphorous oxyanion found in the DNA molecule. This analog acts like the pyrophosphate molecule by binding selectively and reversibly to the binding site on the DNA polymerase enzyme of the virus and inhibiting the DNA chain from elongating further. The role of the DNA polymerase enzyme is to cleave the pyrophosphate molecule from the DNA chain to add further nucleotides to the growing chain. Foscarnet binds and blocks that cleaving process. While foscarnet has selectivity for the viral DNA polymerase, it can also inhibit human DNA polymerase in much larger drug concentrations. However, such high concentrations are seldom necessary to treat these viral pathogens.
