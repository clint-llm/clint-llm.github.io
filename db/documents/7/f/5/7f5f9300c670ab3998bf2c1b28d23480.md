**Underlying Pathophysiology**

The underlying pathophysiology of this phenomenon remains unclear.

**Classification and Subtypes of the Koebner Phenomenon**

Boyd and Nelder classified clinical entities with reported Koebnerization into four categories: true Koebnerization, pseudo-Koebnerization, occasional traumatic localization of lesions, and poor or questionable trauma-induced processes.

The**first group [category I]**referred to astrue koebnerization, includes psoriasis, lichen planus, and vitiligo. In these three conditions, the Koebner phenomenon is reproducible in all patients by a variety of insults. Boyd and Nelder argued that the term Koebner phenomenon should be typically reserved for this group of diseases.

The **second group [category II]**, referred to aspseudo-koebnerization, includes diseases such as molluscum contagiosum and verruca vulgaris, whereby the Koebner phenomenon gets produced by the seeding of infectious agents along with sites subjected to trauma, usually from scratching.

The **third group [category IIII]**,occasional lesions, includes Darier disease and erythema multiforme, which meet some criteria for the Koebner phenomenon but not all. Finally, the fourth group [category IV], questionable trauma-induced process, includes all disorders with a dubious association with trauma, such as pemphigus vulgaris and lupus erythematosus.

Since this publication in 1990, other conditions have demonstrated the Koebner phenomenon, such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, mycosis fungoides, and eruptive xanthomas, among others mentioned in this article.

**Type and Severity of Trauma Inducing Koebner Phenomenon**

Different types of cutaneous injury may trigger this phenomenon, including excoriations, tattoos, friction, trauma, surgical instrumentation, burns, and ultraviolet or irradiation.

Time from skin insult to the appearance of new skin lesions varies. In psoriasis, new lesions typically arise within 10 to 20 days after a skin injury; however, this ranges from 3 days to 20 years.
