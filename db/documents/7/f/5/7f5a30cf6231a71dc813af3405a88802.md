Diffuse or segmental spasm in the coronary arteries causes Printzmetal angina. There is a decrease in blood supply to the myocardium generating symptoms like chest pain. The coronary arteries may develop spasm as a result of exposure to cold weather, exercise, or a substance that promotes vasoconstriction as alpha-agonists (pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline). Recreational drug use, for example, cocaine use, is associated with the development of vasospastic angina, especially when used concurrently with cigarette smoking.
