The incidence of neonatal lupus erythematosus approximates to 2% in offspring of mothers with autoantibodies of Sjogren syndrome autoantigen type A (Ro/SSA) or B (La/SSB) with an 18% to 20% recurrence rate in the following pregnancies. It affects equally males and females, and less than 5% of infants with this condition will develop systemic lupus erythematosus in late adolescence or early adulthood. Neonatal lupus erythematosus causesÂ 80% to 95% of the cases of severe atrioventricular block in the neonatal period (younger than 28 days of life), after this period it is a less frequent cause of AV block (5% of the cases). Presentation of cutaneous manifestations ranges between 7% to 16% of mothers with positive autoantibodies type A (Ro/SSA) or B (La/SSB). These autoantibodies are present in 0.1% to 1.5% of healthy pregnant women, 90% of patients with Sjogren, 20% to 30% with systemic lupus erythematosus and 3% with rheumatoid arthritis. Approximately 25% of the mothers of neonates with neonatal lupus are asymptomatic at the time of delivery, of which 50% will become symptomatic within three years. Another 25% have an undifferentiated autoimmune syndrome, 20% Sjogren syndrome, 15% systemic lupus erythematosus, 15% systemic lupus erythematosus associated with Sjogren syndrome and 1% Rheumatoid arthritis.
