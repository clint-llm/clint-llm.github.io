HTN is considered the most significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. HTN contributes to the highest global burden of disease. Measurement of blood pressure is one of the most important of all medial and clinical tests. Thus it is critical that blood pressure monitoring devices should be accurate. According to a study published in the journal of human HTN, showed evidence from a meta-analysis that many BP monitoring devices do not accurately represent the BP with the arteries of the upper arm. Inaccurate BP measurements can lead to confusion around the optimal HTN guideline thresholds. Also, inaccurate BP (underestimation of true BP) can be a missed opportunity to lower cardiovascular risk. On the other hand, the overestimation of BP can lead to overmedication. So there is a need to improve the accuracy of BP readings with better BP monitoring devices.
