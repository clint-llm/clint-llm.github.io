The hamstring muscle complex occupies the posterior compartment of the thigh and is comprised of three individual muscles. Together, they play a critical role in human activities ranging from standing to explosive actions such as sprinting and jumping. Hamstring injuries are common in elite and amateur sportspeople, and the treatment of such injuries ranges from conservative management to operative fixation. Uninjured hamstring tendons can be used as autografts in knee ligament reconstruction surgery.
