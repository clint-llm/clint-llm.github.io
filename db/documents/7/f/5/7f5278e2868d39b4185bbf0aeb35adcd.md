Untreated pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. Most patients will present with dyspnea and hypoxemia. However, potentially severe complications have been reported in approximately 2.0% of patients. They include cerebral abscess and stroke likely from blood bypassing filtration in the lung capillary bed and paradoxical emboli, respectively.

The local pulmonary complications may include pulmonary AVM arterial rupture leading to severe hemoptysis or hemothorax, which can be life-threatening.

Collateralization and recanalization of pulmonary AVM can appear following treatment. Hence it is imperative to have long-term, regular clinical and imaging follow-ups to evaluate pulmonary AVM enlargement and reperfusion.
