Most isolated rib fractures are diagnosable through a clinical exam. Typically, patients will provide a history of recent blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma and pain at that site. They may also exhibit decreased ability to perform full inspiration due to pain. The physical exam may reveal chest wall bruising, along with bony tenderness to palpitation or crepitus. Any vital sign abnormalities such as hypoxia, tachypnea, or significant respiratory distress should undergo further evaluation of other possible injuries such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac and pulmonary contusions. Lower rib segment injuries should undergo assessment for kidney, liver, and spleen. Any patient with paradoxical chest wall movement or suspicion for multiple rib fractures should be evaluated for flail chest and managed accordingly.
