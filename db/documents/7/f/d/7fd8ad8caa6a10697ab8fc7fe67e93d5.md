The Ross procedure, also known as the switch procedure, is a cardiac surgery procedure in which the diseased aortic valve is replaced with the patient's own pulmonary valve, followed by replacement of the pulmonary valve with a pulmonary homograft. In some children and infants, sometimes and aortic valve replacement is necessary for a variety of reasons. However, inserting a prosthetic valve is not a good option; firstly there are no small-sized aortic valves available and secondly, since the child will grow in size, the prosthetic valve will remain the same size and lead to symptoms of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. In addition, there are some people who do not want to take oral anticoagulant medications for life and hence a Ross procedure would be ideal for them. Unlike a prosthetic valve, the ross procedure has excellent hemodynamics and the risk of embolic complications is almost zero. Finally, as the child grows, so does the valve. Unfortunately, it is now realized that the Ross procedure also has limitations; the pulmonary homograft will develop regurgitation or stenosis after 15-20 years, necessitating another procedure.

The Ross procedure was first developed in the late 1960s and has been performed many times since then. It remains to be the only operation that allows for an aortic valve replacement with a living valve substitute.
