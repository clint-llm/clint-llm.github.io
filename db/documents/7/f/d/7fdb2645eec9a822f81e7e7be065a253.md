PG is a rare disease and does not pose a major health burden. When suspected clinically, the diagnosis must be established, and treatment should be started early as the disease responds well to steroids. A an interprofessional approach between gynecologist and dermatologist is required to ensure coordinated monitoring (search for signs of prematurity, abnormalities of fetal growth, detect possible systemic and local side effects of topical and systemic corticosteroid). The association with hydatiform mole, trophoblastic tumors, or choriocarcinoma must not be forgotten. The pharmacist should encourage medication compliance to help ease the intense pruritus.
