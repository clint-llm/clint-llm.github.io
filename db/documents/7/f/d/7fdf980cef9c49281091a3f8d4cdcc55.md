Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody typically used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, moderate to severe Crohn disease, or moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (inflammatory bowel disease). Ustekinumab mediates the body's T-cell response by acting as an antagonist against interleukin-12 (IL12) and interleukin-23 (IL23). The drug is FDA approved for use in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Ps), particularly in those patients who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, aged 6 or older. Patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) may use ustekinumab as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.

More recently, ustekinumab has been approved for moderate to severely active Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). While ustekinumab has not received FDA approval for many other inflammatory mediated diseases, it has been used off label for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa, Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, pyoderma grangrenosum, pityriasis rubra pilaris, synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, Lichen planus, atopic dermatitis as well as systemic lupus erythematosus.
