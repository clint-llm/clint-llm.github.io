The causative organisms of pertussis are Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. Bordetella is spread by airborne droplets and is highly contagious. Pertussis often affects 100% of non-immune household contacts. Immunity wanes to 50% 12 years after completing a vaccination series. Immunocompromised persons can also contract Bordetella bronchiseptica, which typically affects animals and is commonly known as “a kennel cough.”

Humans are the sole reservoir for Bordetella; the organism is spread via aerosolized droplets produced during a cough. The organism is highly contagious, with the majority of cases occurring during summer.

Risk factors for acquiring pertussis include:

- Pregnancy

- Epidemic exposure

- Lack of immunization

- Close contact with an infected individual
