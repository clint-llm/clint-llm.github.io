**Scapholunate Dissociation**

Injury to the scapholunate ligament complex most commonly occurs after a fall onto an outstretched, ulnar-deviated hand. When the carpus is axially loaded in hyperextension, the proximal pole of the scaphoid will shift dorsally.

Complete injury to all three components of the scapholunate ligament will not result in radiographically significant scapholunate diastasis.

**Lunotriquetral Dissociation**

Injury to the lunotriquetral ligamentous complex may occur after a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in radial deviation. Upon impact with the ground, the force is concentrated onto the hypothenar eminence driving the pisiform into the triquetrum. This causes the triquetrum to translate dorsally while the lunate remains constrained within the lunate fossa by the radiolunate ligaments. The result is the rupture of the lunotriquetral ligamentous complex.

Disruption of all three components of the lunotriquetral ligament may result in slight gapping between the lunate and triquetrum.Â Over time, the secondary stabilizers of the lunotriquetral joint will fail. This can result in a rotational deformity, as described below in the complications section.
