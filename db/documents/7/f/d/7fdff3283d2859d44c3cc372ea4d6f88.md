The conidia, which can become aerosolized when the fungal colony is disturbed, are the main infectious particles produced by Blastomyces dermatitidis. After conidia are inhaled, they pass into the lower respiratory tract. The conidia can be phagocytized by bronchopulmonary mononuclear cells and killed by neutrophils and macrophages, explaining the asymptomatic infection in some individuals. Blastomyces dermatitidis converts to the yeast form, the thick wall provides resistance to phagocytosis and killing, which can result in symptomatic pulmonary infection. In addition, the immune-modulating glycoprotein BAD-1 facilitates its binding to macrophages, allowing dissemination through the blood and lymphatics to other areas of the body. The pyogranulomatous inflammatory response is a unique feature of blastomycosis and is caused by an influx of neutrophils, macrophages, and eventual granuloma formation.
