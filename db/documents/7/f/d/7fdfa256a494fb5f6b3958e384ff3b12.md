Cardioselective beta-1-adrenergic antagonists such as atenolol work by selectively binding to the beta-1 adrenergic receptors found in vascular smooth muscle and the heart, blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of endogenous catecholamines such as isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, thereby inhibiting sympathetic stimulation.

It also exerts its effects in higher doses by competitively blocking beta-2-adrenoreceptors, primarily located in the bronchial and vascular musculature. It has no membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Atenolol has low lipid solubility, resulting in reduced brain penetrance, resulting in fewer CNS side effects.

Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists also increase the AV node's refractory period. Therefore, it may also be used off-license to treat supraventricular tachycardia and prevent paroxysmal attacks of atrial fibrillation.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: The bioavailability of orally administered atenolol is approximately 50%. Peak blood levels are attained between two and four hours after oral administration and within 5 minutes following intravenous administration.

Distribution: As discussed above, atenolol has low lipid solubility (hydrophilic beta blocker); hence there is low diffusion across the intestinal membrane and blood-brain barrier (BBB). Plasma protein binding is approximately 10%.

Metabolism: The hepatic metabolism of atenolol is minimal, and the parent drug appears to be the major radiolabelled component in blood.

Excretion: Atenolol is primarily excreted by the renal route by glomerular filtration and active secretion. The half-life elimination is approximately 6 to 7 hours.
