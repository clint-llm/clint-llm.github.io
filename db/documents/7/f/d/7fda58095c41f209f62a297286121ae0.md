Multiple antibiotic classes are recommended for use in preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The antibiotics utilized are bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic. This means that any of the targeted organisms are killed instead of just preventing the multiplication of further growth.Â It should be noted that certain antibiotics can exhibit bacteriostatic or bactericidal properties depending on bacterial sensitivity and antibiotic concentration. For example, clindamycin is bacteriostatic at lower doses, but at higher doses, it can exhibit bactericidal properties. In most surgeries, the intent is to ensure the bactericidal concentration has been reached in the blood and tissues before incision.
