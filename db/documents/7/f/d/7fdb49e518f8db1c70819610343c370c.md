There are many known causes of chronic bronchitis, but the most important causative factor is exposure to cigarette smoke, either due to active smoking or passive inhalation. Many inhaled irritants to the respiratory tract, such as smog, industrial pollutants, and toxic chemicals, can cause chronic bronchitis. Although bacterial and viral infections usually cause acute bronchitis, repeated exposure to infections can cause chronic bronchitis. The predominant viruses that are causative are Influenza types A and B, and the dominant bacterial agents are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Mycoplasma pneumonia. People who have an associated background in respiratory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis have a higher predisposition to develop chronic bronchitis. People who have repeated exposure to environmental pollutants such as dust or airborne chemicals such as ammonia and sulfur dioxide have a higher risk of developing chronic bronchitis. Chronic gastroesophageal reflux is a well-documented but less frequent cause of chronic bronchitis.
