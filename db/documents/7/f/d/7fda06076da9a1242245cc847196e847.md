In infants with primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH), hypofunction of the thyroid gland typically causes low T4 and T3 levels, with elevated TSH and TRH levels due to feedback mechanism to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. In compensated or subclinical hypothyroidism, serum T4 remains normal, while the TSH level is elevated. Infants with central hypothyroidism have low T4 or free T4, with low or low-normal TSH levels. TSH is the most sensitive indicator of thyroid dysfunction and the HPT axis. Additionally, patients with TBG deficiency present with a low total T4 and normal TSH. They are likely euthyroid. However, a free T4 and a TBG level should be added to confirm their thyroid status.
