Pinguecula is a benign lesion. It is a grey white-yellow elevated round mass on the bulbar conjunctiva. It usually occurs within the interpalpebral conjunctiva, para-limbal zone at 3 o'clock, or 9 o'clock position. But, it has a predilection for the nasal part of the bulbar conjunctiva. It appears to be a precursor of pterygium, which may encroach onto the cornea. However, the relation of pinguecula and pterygium is controversial, and the progression of pinguecula to pterygium has come into question.

Pinguecula does not affect visual acuity. Though it is asymptomatic, it causes cosmetic complaints. However, if it is inflamed, it is known as pingueculitis. When a  pinguecula is inflamed,  the dilated blood vessels release histamine,  serotonin,  bradykinin, and prostaglandins to result in the symptoms of pingueculitis. The surface of the conjunctiva overlying the pinguecula will interfere with the normal spreading of the tear film. Thus dry eye symptoms such as burning sensation, itching, and foreign body sensation occur. Dellen may appear near the pinguecula. Tear break-up time may diminish in patients with pinguecula.
