Trauma is the most common etiology of compartment syndrome. Other causes of anterior leg compartment syndrome can vary wildly. Some examples include trauma (blunt or penetrating trauma, fracture, hemorrhage, burns), infectious (tetany, myositis), neurogenic (seizures), toxicology (envenomation, drug or alcohol abuse resulting in coma, androgenic steroid abuse), renal (decreased serum osmolarity), musculoskeletal (tear of the muscles of the anterior compartment, everyday activity, muscle hypertrophy, vigorous exercise, chronic repetitive exercise), autoimmune (vasculitis), vascular (deep vein thrombosis, hemorrhage), rhabdomyolysis, and postischemic swelling.

Compartment syndrome can occur during routine medical or surgical care. Causes include dressings, splints or casts which are too tight, lying in the lithotomy position, malfunctioning sequential compression devices, intramuscular or intracompartmental injections, intraosseous line or infusion of hypertonic intravenous (IV) fluid or contrast agent, bleeding into compartments from attempted cannulation of vein or artery, intraoperative use of pressurized pulsatile irrigation, and military antishock trousers. Compartment syndrome can occur as the sequelae of orthopedic procedures and may be the result of post-operative bleeding, muscle edema, or tight closure of fascial layers.
