Detailed history taking and meticulous examination are required to minimize the chances of missing a laryngeal fracture in a clinical setting. As laryngeal trauma is a matter of airway emergency, inter-departmental teamwork is needed. Proper communication between different teams managing laryngeal trauma is important to avoid delay or missing diagnosis. If there is any clinical suspicion, further evaluation with endoscopy and imaging is warranted to prevent delay in treatment and to avoid complications.

Patients surgically treated for laryngeal fractures need multidisciplinary input and long-term rehabilitation with follow up to achieve optimum laryngeal functions like swallowing and phonation.
