Blood transfusions are often necessary in medicine, and all healthcare workers have to be familiar with transfusion reactions. Patient on any ward can receive a blood transfusion and similarly all nurses have to know the potential complications and how to manage them. The majority of blood transfusion reactions occur because of a clerical/nursing error. While some reactions can be severe and lead to death, many transfusion reactions are benign. Anaphylactic reactions from a blood transfusion are very rare but often result in a fatality. Other reactions include TRALI which ranges from 1-9% and often requires intensive pulmonary support to prevent a fatal outcome. The incidence of bacterial contamination is rare but can occur from both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The key to reducing the morbidity is vigilance on the part of the nurse. During the patient medical history, one should ask about prior transfusions and any complications. If there is ever any doubt about the patient's blood group or the blood type being administered, the laboratory should be asked to reconfirm the status.
