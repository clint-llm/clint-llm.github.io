Ziconotide is first cleaved by endopeptidases and exopeptidases. After systemic absorption, ziconotide also undergoes proteolytic cleavage by a multitude of peptidases and proteases found in most organs.Â  Although there are no formal studies regarding medication administration in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction, ziconotide is a peptide that does not undergo phase I biotransformation or phase II conjugation reactions. Also, there are likely no significant drug-drug interactions. Ziconotide shows linear kinetics with a half-life of 4.5 hours. No development of tolerance has been seen with intrathecal ziconotide infusion.
