The Banff grading system is a classification of the severity of chronic renal allograft nephropathy. This was originally implemented in 1997 and updated subsequently in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2017.

- Grade I: Mild fibrosis of the interstitium and mild atrophy of the tubules, either with or without specific glomerular or vascular findings that can suggest chronic allograft nephropathy.

- Grade II: Moderate interstitial fibrosis (affecting 25% to 50% of the cortical area) and moderate tubular atrophy (involving 26% to 50% of the area of the cortical tubules).

- Grade III: Severe interstitial fibrosis (affecting greater than 50 percent of the cortical area) and tubular atrophy (involving greater than 50% of the area of the cortical tubules).
