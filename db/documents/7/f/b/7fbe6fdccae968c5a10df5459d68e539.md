Opioids have relative contraindications, and each patient should have an appropriate assessment before discerning whether to administer opioids. For example, opioids are known to cause respiratory depression. Administration of opioids to patients with head trauma requires great care, as the increased pCO2 from hypoventilation can induce vasodilation and increased intracranial pressure. As previously noted, patients with pulmonary dysfunction may not be able to compensate for opioid-induced respiratory depression. Opioids are also not the first analgesic of choice when patients are experiencing liver or kidney dysfunction, as poor excretion and metabolism may result in the accumulation of byproducts. Individuals with adrenal and thyroid deficiencies may be more sensitive to opioids.

Pregnancy is another relative contraindication as the fetus may show signs of dependency. Approximately 50% of babies develop neonatal abstinence syndrome when exposed to opioids while in the womb. Infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome may develop diarrhea, sweating, sneezing, crying, tachypnea, and irritability.
