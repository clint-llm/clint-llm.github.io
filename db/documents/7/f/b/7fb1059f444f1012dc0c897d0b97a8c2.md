Various conditions have correlations with gastroparesis; the majority of cases are idiopathic, diabetic, medication-induced, or postsurgical. One of the studies done at a tertiary care center categorized the etiologies in 146 patients: 36% idiopathic, 29% diabetic, 13% postgastric surgery, 7.5% Parkinson disease, 4.8% collagen vascular disorders, 4.1% intestinal pseudoobstruction, and 6% miscellaneous causes.

- Idiopathic - most common cause present in about half of patients

- Diabetes mellitus (DM) - most common and severe in type 1 diabetics

- Rheumatological diseases - amyloidosis, scleroderma

- Autoimmune - autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility causing delayed emptying

- Neurological conditions - stress, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, brainstem CVA and tumors, autonomic neuropathy

- Postsurgical -  vagal nerve injury during fundoplication and partial gastric resection

- Trauma - spinal cord injury

- Viral infections including Norwalk virus and rotavirus

- Medications - narcotics, cyclosporine, phenothiazines, dopamine agonists, octreotide, alpha-2-adrenergic agonists (e.g. clonidine), tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, GLP-1 agonists exenatide or analogs liraglutide, lithium, progesterone

Diabetic patients at risk of developing gastroparesis include type 1 diabetes, long duration of the disease, poorly controlled blood sugars with higher fluctuations, and associated other autonomic neuropathic complications. As noted in other diabetes-related complications, oxidative damage of these tissues is the prominent mechanism in gastroparesis.

Post-surgical etiology: Any surgery involving the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and pancreas could pose a risk of injury to the vagal nerve. Vagus nerve controls contraction and smooth muscles of the stomach and sensory pathways that coordinate forward propulsion of gastric contents. Hence, injury of the vagus nerve delays gastric emptying. Postsurgical gastroparesis may develop immediately after the surgery or months to years after the surgery occurred. Common surgical procedures associated with this complication include Nissen fundoplication, gastrectomy, pancreatic cancer cryoablation, pancreatoduodenectomy. Rarely gastroparesis has been reported in gynecological surgeries involving the lower abdomen.
