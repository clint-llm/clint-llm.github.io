The diagnosis and management of G6PD deficiency are best done with an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, pediatrician, internist, laboratory professional, pediatric nurses, and a hematologist. In newborns, the treatment focuses on managing jaundice and preventing kernicterus. In older patients, management depends primarily on the overall clinical picture. Less severe presentations may be managed with supportive care and discontinuation and avoidance of the offending agents. Treat any infections as indicated by history and exam. More severe cases may require transfusions.

The primary caregiver, nurse practitioner, and pharmacist must regularly evaluate the patient's medications to ensure that none is associated with this disorder.
