HPS is most commonly associated with portal hypertension due toÂ chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. However, portal hypertension without underlying liver disease can also cause HPS. Acute liver disease, like acute hepatitis resulting in acute liver failure, is a rare cause of HPS. The presence and severity of HPS do not correlate with the severity of liver disease.
