Current indications for saphenous vein grafting in the setting of coronary artery disease include indications for coronary artery bypass grafting as outlined by the American College of Cardiology and the AHA. Given its high maintained patency rate, LIMA has been considered the bypass vessel of choice, especially to the LAD. Historically saphenous vein grafts have been used asÂ additional grafts beyond the LIMA or have been utilized in circumstances that the LIMA is unavailable, however recent data has led to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons recommending a radial artery (RA) graft as the vessels of choice over saphenous vein grafts given the significant increase in arterial graft patency over vein.

In addition, saphenous vein grafts are often used for peripheral bypass surgeries particularly in the lower extremities. For example, a saphenous vein may be mobilized and utilized for a femoral to the popliteal artery for occluded vessels not amenable to conservative treatment or angioplasty. The saphenous veins (both GSV and lesser saphenous vein) can also be used to increase vascular pedicle length in free tissue transfer reconstruction, especially of the head and neck.
