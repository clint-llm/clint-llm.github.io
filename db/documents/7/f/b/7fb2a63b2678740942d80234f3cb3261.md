Important differential diagnosis for syncope include

1. Seizure disorder: SeizuresÂ associated with aura, tonic-clonic activity, prolonged duration of unconsciousness, urinary and/or bowel incontinence, tongue biting and confusion after regaining consciousness. These differentiate syncope from seizures.

2. Hypoglycemia.

3. Panic attacks: Feeling impending doom, palpitations, air hunger and tingling of perioral region and tips of fingers.
