The space in which the MPFL inserts onto the patella is variable.

While the length of the MPFL is rather consistent, averaging 55 mm, its width can vary between 3 to 33 mm. With such a highly variable width, identifying this ligament may be challenging. Additionally, there has also been variability in the literature regarding the origin of the MPFL. Common sites include the medial femoral epicondyle, the adductor tubercle, and the space in between the two. Schottle’s point is a radiographic landmark used to identify the origin of the MPFL. During MPFL reconstruction surgery, fluoroscopy is used intraoperatively to locate this point.
