The majority of patients have normal lab parameters, possibly reflecting minor bleeding into the adrenals. Leukocytosis and anemia may be present. Biochemical markers of adrenal insufficiency such as hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia may also be detected. Other important derangements include excess cortisol and elevated catecholamine levels, which may reflect the transient release from the gland destruction. Low cortisol with elevated ACTH is also an important diagnostic clue signifying extensive cortical involvement.

Imaging remains the most important diagnostic tool, with computed tomography (CT) scan being an important modality. The appearance of imaging varies with the age of the hematoma.****Fresh hematomas demonstrate high attenuation, which decreases over time**.**Ultrasonography is the modality of choice in infants due to their small body size and relatively large adrenal size.
