Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a rare cause of stroke in the general population, but one of the more common causes of stroke in patients younger than 45 years of age. Its signs and symptoms can be vague, making diagnosis difficult. Spontaneous dissections have been reported, but incidental minor trauma typically precipitates this potentially dangerous condition. Often neck distortion caused by chiropractic manipulation, bending of the neck, or blunt trauma causes the dissection. The dissection of the artery may ultimately lead to a stroke which is often delayed for days following the acute dissection. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with vertebral artery dissection and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of vertebral artery dissection.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with vertebral artery dissection.
- Summarize the treatment options for vertebral artery dissection.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by vertebral artery dissection.
