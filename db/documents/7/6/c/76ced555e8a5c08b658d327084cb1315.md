The evaluation for Apert syndrome in the setting of known family history is a clinical one, as the characteristic physical examination findings confirm the diagnosis. In cases where the clinical presentation is not clear and no family history to support the diagnosis, additional tests such as advanced imaging techniques can help. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the brain are used to detect craniosynostosis or other skeletal abnormalities (peri sutural sclerosis, reduced serration, and bony bridging and/or the absence of the suture altogether). These same imaging techniques can be helpful in detecting complications related to the syndrome, such as increased intracranial pressure.

Much like that discussed with Crouzon syndrome, in which there is an unclear diagnosis or the syndrome has atypical features, genetic and molecular testing can be pursued. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanism of multiple craniosynostosis syndromes is related to FGFR mutations and abnormal signaling. Prenatal genetic testing, MRI, and ultrasounds can be utilized to confirm the diagnosis before the birth of the child.

As described above, the history, physical, and imaging findings are used to confirm the specific craniosynostosis but can be difficult due to significant overlap amongst the syndromes (Pfeiffer, Apert, Saether-Chotzen, Carpenter, and Jackson-Weiss syndromes).
