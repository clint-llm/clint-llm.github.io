Patients with acute bronchitis should be made aware of the importance of lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation and the avoidance of allergens and pollutants to lower their risk of recurrence and complications. Influenza and pneumonia immunizations are especially recommended in special groups including adults older than 65, children younger than two years (older than six months), pregnant women, and residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Patients should also be provided education regarding the risks of prescribing antibiotics when they are not indicated including antibiotic resistance, cost, and potential side effects.
