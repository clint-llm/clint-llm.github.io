Respiratory failure is a frequently encountered condition in the practice of critical care. In conditions where ineffective gaseous exchange occurs, as in severe respiratory insufficiency, life-saving strategies such as mechanical ventilation are considerations.

ECMO devices come in various forms according to the circuit configured and the components forming it. Configurations involving draining the deoxygenated blood from the venous compartment and returning oxygenated-decarboxylated blood to a vein is called venovenous ECMO (VV-ECMO). Similarly, when the blood is configured to return to the artery, it is veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO). Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) devices are specialized ECMO devices that predominantly focus on CO2 removal — thus reducing the PaCO2 and, eventually, the work of breathing and MV support. The potential advantage of ECCO2R devices is the reduced blood flow through the circuit. The membrane in action is composed of polymethylpentene (PMP) or siloxane.

The basis for optional components such as the pump system in the configuration depends on the chosen circuit. Arterio-venous ECCO2R circuits do not need the pump in the configuration for functioning, whereas veno-venous ECCO2R requires its need as of the low-pressure system. The use of anticoagulants is necessary to prevent thrombus formation within the circuit.
