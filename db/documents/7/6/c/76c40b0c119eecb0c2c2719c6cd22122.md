The refractive status assessment of the eye is labeled as refraction. It is classified as objective and subjective refraction. Subjective refraction is the assessment of refractive status by a combination of spherical and cylindrical lenses to determine the best-corrected visual acuity with accommodation relaxed. The various instruments necessary for subjective refraction are a manual refraction unit with a phoropter, trail frame, trial lenses, Snellen's visual acuity chart, pinhole, occluder, and Jackson's cross-cylinder and duo-chrome test. The various steps of subjective refraction include monocular subjective refraction, binocular balancing, and near vision correction. The fogging technique and duo-chrome test are necessary to achieve binocular single vision using spherical lenses. This activity describes the technique of subjective refraction, the methodology, potential diagnosis, and the clinical significance of subjective refraction.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of subjective refraction.
- Summarize the instruments needed for subjective refraction.

- Outline the methodology of subjective refraction.
- Explain how to make a potential diagnosis and advice subjective refractive correction.
