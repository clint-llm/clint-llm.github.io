Dacarbazine had been the mainstay of metastatic melanoma chemotherapy, until the recent advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors and mutation-driven therapy; however, it never showed a clear survival benefit.

Metastatic ALM has been shown to be less susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors owing to a poor immune response to the tumor.

While other types of CMM harbor frequent BRAF mutations, ALM rarely has these mutations and is thus less susceptible to the commonly used BRAF/MEK inhibitors. NRAS mutations may cause the resultant tumor to be susceptible to BRAF and MEK inhibitors due to the location of the NRAS upstream of BRAF.
