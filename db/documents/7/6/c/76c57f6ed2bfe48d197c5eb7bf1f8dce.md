Using a specific definition of UARS (AHI <5/h, minimum SpO ≥ 92%, the presence of airflow limitation during sleep for ≥5% of total sleep time, and daytime sleepiness and/or fatigue), the prevalence of the UARS in a recent study was reported being of 3.1% (4.4% in women and 1.5% in men).

The prevalence of UARS is not known; however, it is reported that about 5.3% of all obstructive non-apneic events in patients with OSA are due to RERAs.
