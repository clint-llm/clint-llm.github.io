Thallium, a chemical element with the symbol TI, has an atomic number 81 on the periodic table. Thallium sulfate was once used as an ant and rat poison.

Similar thallium salts were once used to treat dermatophytosis. Before the use of technetium-99m for nuclear medicine studies, thallium-201, a radioactive isotope, was the mainstay and is still used for stress tests evaluating coronary artery disease. This type of thallium is more than 4000 times less potent. Scintigraphy using thallium evaluates blood supply to tissue thallium uptake. Exercise or drugs used to vasodilate normal coronary arteries cause alteration of circulating blood, leading to a reduction of coronary blood circulation (coronary steal syndrome).

**Natural History**

Thallium is a gray post-transition metal that is not found in free nature. Though similar to the tin when isolated, thallium discolors when exposed to air.

**Patterns of Spread**

- Absorbed through the skin

- Respiratory inhalation

- Absorption through the gastrointestinal tract
