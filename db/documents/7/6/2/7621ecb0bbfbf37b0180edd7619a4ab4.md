The typical pattern of nursing caries is explained by the chronology of tooth eruption, the duration of the detrimental habit, and the protective action of the tongue while breast or bottle feeding.

The upper incisors are among the first to erupt; therefore, they will be exposed to the cariogenic habit for longer.
