Salivary gland tumors are characterized by diverse histological appearances and variable biological behavior. The distinction between tumor types can be difficult, particularly based on material from fine-needle aspiration (FNA). This activity outlines the evaluation and management of salivary gland tumors and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the types of salivary gland tumors.
- Describe how to properly evaluate a patient for salivary gland tumors.
- Review the treatment and management options available for salivary gland tumors.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies to improve care for patients with salivary gland tumors.
