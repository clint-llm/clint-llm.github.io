Acromioclavicular (AC) and sternoclavicular (SC) joint injuries are most commonly seen in a contact sport setting (such as football, rugby, and ice hockey) or traumatic setting. The severity of these injuries can vary, the worst of which require surgical intervention. For those that do not require surgery, osteopathic manipulative treatment (such as muscle-energy) is a valuable option in the treatment of these injuries. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment procedure of the AC and SC joints with muscle energy. It highlights the role of the healthcare team in treating patients with these injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the AC and SC joints.
- Describe the diagnostic steps to identify somatic dysfunctions of the AC and SC joints.
- Summarize the muscle energy procedure, along with its indications and contraindications, for the AC and SC joint.
- Outline the importance of communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving muscle energy treatment for the AC and SC joints.
