Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of synostotic plagiocephaly can prevent aesthetic sequelae in children.

Deformational plagiocephaly treatment primarily includes position behavior modification; however, in some cases, additional measures are necessary, including helmet therapy.

Education should be given to parents regarding positioning and the use of tummy time. Intervention should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made.

Deformational plagiocephaly will not cause any developmental or neurocognitive delay.
