Clinicians are beginning to reconsider neuromodulation surgery as a last resort for the treatment of refractory psychiatric disorders. Neurosurgical interventions aimed at treating psychiatric disorders are grouped into two categories: destructive (ablative psychosurgery) or selective stimulation (neuromodulation psychosurgery). Neuromodulation surgery involves implanting a device in the brain that modulates the neural networks within the brain. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in providing neuromodulation surgery for patients with psychiatric disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications and contraindications for neuromodulation for psychiatric disorders.
- Review neuromodulation surgery in patients with psychiatric disorders.
- Summarize the principle of deep brain stimulation for psychiatric disorders.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members in providing neuromodulation treatment for patients with psychiatric disorders.
