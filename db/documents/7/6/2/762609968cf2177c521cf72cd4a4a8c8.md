Calcium gets absorbed through two main mechanisms:

- A transcellular active transport process in the duodenum and jejunum

- A paracellular passive transport process along the entire small intestine

Calcium level regulation occurs via several signaling molecules, including parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, and calcitonin. Calcium is critical for many physiologic functions. Calcium is a major component of the bone matrix and teeth. Additionally, various calcium channels are involved in blood vessel constriction and relaxation, muscle contraction, nerve action potentials, and cardiac electrophysiology. Calcium ions are also an important component of blood clotting pathways.
