PRK is an option in patients with myopia up to -12 diopter (D), astigmatism up to 6 D, and hyperopia up to 5 D.

Several reasons exist why PRK may be desirable over other surgical options for the correction of visual refractive errors:

- First, patients may be reluctant to undergo procedures that require flap formation due to fear of related complications such as incomplete flap, free flap, buttonhole, flap dislocation, epithelial ingrowth, folds, and wrinkles.

- PRK may also be preferable in pilots, professional athletes, or other individuals in whom there is a higher risk of flap dislocation.

- Some ophthalmologists who rarely perform refractive surgery may elect to perform PRK over LASIK, which is generally considered a more complex procedure.

- PRK may be an option in select patients in whom LASIK is contraindicated, such as those with thin corneas, epithelial anterior basement membrane dystrophy (due to risk of epithelial ingrowth), history of recurrent erosions, anteriorly placed scleral buckles, or very flat or very steep corneas.

- PRK may be performed as an enhancement procedure to correct residual refractive errors following corneal transplantation, penetrating keratoplasty, LASIK, cataract surgery, or other surgeries of the eye. Studies on the use of PRK as an enhancement procedure have demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy.
