Physical exam findings depend on the disease stage. The patient often initially complains of bilateral, painful, purpuric lesions that progress to punched-out ulcers, with or without surrounding livedo reticularis. These lesions will heal with porcelain-white, stellate scars, with or without surrounding telangiectasias. History typically reveals that the ulceration is recurrent and is often exacerbated in the summer and during pregnancy.

It is essential to rule out other possible causes, so history should focus on eliminating underlying diseases such as peripheral arterial disease, venous stasis, and malignancy. A patient with atrophie blanche-like lesions will lack a history or physical exam finding of punched-out ulcers.
