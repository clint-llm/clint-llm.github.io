Micropenis is a physical finding that can be a sign of a systemic hormonal abnormality or a genetic process. Many conditions can present with micropenis. A systematic multidisciplinary team approach is crucial for evaluation and management. Pediatric endocrinologists and urologists are almost always involved in providing care for patients with micropenis. The ancillary services (geneticist, psychologist, social worker, and pharmacist) are essential to provide family support and maintain the mental well being of the patients and their families. As most micropenis patients present during the early neonatal period, the nursing assessment could be the first step in making the diagnosis.

Although experts have suggested a standardized evaluation and management plan, the variable presentation and the different etiological causes make it essential to do a comprehensive history and physical examination before ordering diagnostic tests. Medical and surgical treatments available for micropenis result in acceptable outcomes in most cases; however, social dissatisfaction remains a potential concern.
