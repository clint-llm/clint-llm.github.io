Appropriate biopsy site selection is critical to confirm the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. Clinical symptoms such as visual disturbances, headache, or a painful vessel assist the surgeon in selecting laterality for the temporal artery biopsy, even though the physical examination poorly correlates with biopsy results.

After choosing which temporal artery to biopsy, Doppler ultrasound is employed to identify a peripheral segment of the frontal branch of the temporal artery in the anatomic safe zone. This branch is often located just posterior to the anterior hairline, a location that facilitates cosmesis and scar camouflage.

The patient is placed in a reclined position. The surgeon makes two marks: at least a 5-centimeter length of the artery and a 3- to 4-centimeter incision. This length of the artery is necessary due to the potential for segmental manifestations of the underlying disease process. (Video 2)
