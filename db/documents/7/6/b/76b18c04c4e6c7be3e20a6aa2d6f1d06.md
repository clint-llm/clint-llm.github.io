For patients with acute digoxin toxicity, it is critical to obtain an ECG, a basic metabolic panel, and digoxin levels on arrival. These tests should be repeated at 6 hours post-ingestion. Digoxin's effect on the ECG is characterized by diffuse scooping of the ST segments, which can be seen with therapeutic levels and is not associated with toxicity. The most common ECG abnormality is frequent PVCs, although the "pathognomonic" ECG finding is bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. However, this has been reported in aconitine poisoning.

In the setting of acute overdose, acetaminophen, and aspirin levels can help screen for occult overdose.

In chronic toxicity, the cause of toxicity should be sought. Common causes include infection, renal failure, and accidental overdose. Serum digoxin levels do not always correlate with toxicity, given variable tissue levels and other factors affecting digoxin's toxicodynamic effects.
