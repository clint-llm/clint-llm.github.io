The diagnosis of brain death is primarily derived clinically.

The first step in determining brainstem death is to notify the next of kin about the process.

The interval observation period of 6 hour period is usually considered sufficient in adults and children over one year age. A reliable interval period has not been established for children less than seven days old. For children between 7 days to two months, two examinations and electroencephalograms (EEGs) should be separated by at least 48 hours. In contrast, in children between two months to one year, two examinations and EEGs should be separated by at least 24 hours.

Repeat the clinical assessment of brain stem reflexes.

The steps and all examinations require full documentation.

Confirmatory testing should only take place out when deemed necessary and include:

- Angiography: the absence of intracerebral filling at the level of the carotid bifurcation or circle of Willis.

- Electroencephalography:  absent electrical activity during at least 30 minutes of recording

- Nuclear brain scan: the absence of uptake of isotope (“hollow skull phenomenon”)

- Somatosensory evoked potentials: Brain death confirmed by the bilateral absence of N20-P22 response with median nerve stimulation.

- Transcranial doppler ultrasonography: small systolic peaks confirm brain death in early systole without diastolic flow or reverberating flow.

Medical Record Documentation should include:

- Etiology and irreversibility of coma

- Absent motor response to pain

- Absent  brainstem reflexes during two separate examinations separated by at least 6 hours

- Absent respiration with pCO2 greater than or equal to 60 mmHg

- Justification for, and result of, confirmatory tests if applicable
