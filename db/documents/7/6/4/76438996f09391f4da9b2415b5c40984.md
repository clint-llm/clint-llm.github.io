The etiology of mania, and more generally, bipolar I disorder, are not known. There is strong evidence that the cause is a combination of genetic, psychological, and social factors. There have been multiple studies involving families which show a definite genetic component. In a study involving monozygotic twins, it was revealed that up to 80% of twins are concordant for the disorder when one of the siblings is positive for the disorder.Â This is also evidence of environmental influences since there is not a 100% concordance between monozygotic twins. Multiple studies have shown that several allele frequencies are involved in both bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia. There is also extensive anecdotal evidence that stressful life events and other psychosocial factors contribute to the onset and frequency of manic phases.
