General indications for upper extremity replantation are thumb amputation, multiple digit amputation, mid-palm (trans-metacarpal) amputation, single-digit amputations distal to the insertion of the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon (Zone 1), sharp amputations at the hand, forearm, or elbow level, and any amputation in a child. Any patient transferred to a Level 1 trauma center or replant capable facilityÂ should be done after consultation with the hand surgeon at that facility to ensure the transfer is appropriate.
