Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular, pleomorphic gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria that causes Q fever. It exhibits phase variation, which is a form of antigenic shift. It exists in phase I form in animals, which is highly infectious, and in noninfectious phase II form when subcultured in cells or embryonated eggs.
