The superior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus minimus. It is a branch of the lumbosacral plexus with nerve root origins of L4, L5, and S1. The nerve runs between the gluteus minimus and medius alongside the superior gluteal arteryâ€™s deep branch. It then splits off into a superior branch and an inferior branch. It is the inferior branch that supplies the gluteus minimus.
