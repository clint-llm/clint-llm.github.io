Endometrial receptivity describes the intricate process undertaken by the uterine lining to prepare for the implantation of an embryo. The accepted definition of endometrial receptivity is "the period of endometrial maturation during which the trophectoderm of the blastocyst can attach to the endometrial epithelial cells and subsequently invade the endometrial stroma and vasculature." Successful implantation and early pregnancy maintenance rely on endometrial receptivity, such that its deficiency or absence leads to early pregnancy loss and infertility. This activity reviews the concept of endometrial receptivity, embryo implantation, and the current technology available to assess endometrial receptivity.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the importance of endometrial receptivity in achieving clinical pregnancy.
- Describe the pathophysiology of endometrial receptivity.
- Identify factors that can disturb endometrial receptivity.
- Summarize the current methods for assessing endometrial receptivity.
