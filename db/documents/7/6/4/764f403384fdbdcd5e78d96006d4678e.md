Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a common etiology of sexual developmental disorders resulting in varying phenotypes. These disorders of androgen action present as 46 XY disorders or differences of sex development (DSD). The phenotypic spectrum of AIS depends on the residual androgen receptor activity and encompasses individuals with a completely female phenotype to male phenotype with infertility/undervirilization.
