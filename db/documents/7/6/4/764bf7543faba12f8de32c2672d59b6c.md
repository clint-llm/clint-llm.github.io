For coronary arteries,Â orbital atherectomy (OA) is indicated to facilitate stent delivery in patients with known severely calcified coronary artery lesions who are candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting. The Orbital Atherectomy System has the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to treat severely calcified coronary artery lesions.

Though there are no further manufacturer indications, the clinical application may be extended to other situations given the crown size and the ability to adjust ablation diameter. Potential situations to utilize OA include severely calcified lesions in a patient with multi-vessel disease, lesion preparation for bioresorbable scaffold placement, unprotected left main disease, ostial lesions, and chronic total occlusions.
