Patients with Frey syndrome should be managed in consultation with an interprofessional team comprising otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, dermatologists, neurologists, primary clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and allergy specialists. Patients at high risk for developing Frey syndrome, such as those with large parotid tumors or extensive trauma to the parotid region, may benefit from prophylactic surgical reconstruction to prevent aberrant nerve regeneration. In the absence of surgical or traumatic history, children with gustatory sweating should be closely followed and evaluated by primary care providers and allergists to rule out food hypersensitivity.

As the onset of Frey syndrome can be delayed for months to years after surgery or injury, primary clinicians must remain vigilant for its development and refer patients back to the operating surgeon in a prompt manner. Collaboration among dermatologists, otolaryngologists, and plastic surgeons can provide patients with first-line conservative medical treatment such as topical antiperspirants, anticholinergics, botulinum toxin injections, or with a surgical solution if necessary. Finally, since patients may develop social anxiety and avoidance due to the visible presentation of the condition, especially in public settings, formal peer support groups can aid patients in addressing their concerns.
