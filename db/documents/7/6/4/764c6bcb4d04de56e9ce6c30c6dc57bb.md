Mastery learning has been extensively studied for the acquisition of procedural skills.  As learners perform these procedures better, patients experience fewer complications and shorter lengths of stay.

Interestingly, in one study, deliberate practice was shown as an effective method to overcome gender differences in procedural skills. Historically, males have achieved higher scores on the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery.  Ritter et al. demonstrated that a curriculum focused on mastery learning supported by deliberate practice can virtually eliminate these disparate results.
