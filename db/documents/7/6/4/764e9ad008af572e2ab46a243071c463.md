Preconception counseling, risk identification, and intervention require an interprofessional approach and consistent documentation in the healthcare record. The healthcare team should have access to the complete plan of care from the services used by the patient within the system. In order to improve patient outcomes, every provider should address the potential impacts of health status on pregnancy in women and men of reproductive age. In women seeing multiple providers for medical and behavioral care, an interprofessional approach to planning pregnancy can be advantageous in identifying and addressing risks prior to pregnancy.
