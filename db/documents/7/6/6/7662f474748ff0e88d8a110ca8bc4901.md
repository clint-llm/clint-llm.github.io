Diagnosis and treatment of high-altitude illnesses present several unique challenges. First, modern technology makes it possible, even for inexperienced climbers, to travel from sea level to high altitude in a short duration of time. Such rapidity of ascent generally makes acclimatization difficult. Furthermore, untrained climbers could have comorbidities that might mimic, mask, or aggravate symptoms of high-altitude illness. Moreover, common travel-related illnesses, such as dehydration and infections such as pneumonia or food poisoning, could co-exist, further confounding the clinical picture. Such challenges could be overcome by a thorough understanding of the signs, symptoms, and pathophysiology of high-altitude illnesses, as described below.
