Histopathology of the lesions commonly seen in NF-1 is discussed below:

- **Neurofibroma:**These are well-circumscribed spindle cell proliferation, but they rarelyÂ are encapsulated. They have a mucinous background and many mast cells. Spindle cells have a wavy appearance. As neurofibromas result from a proliferation of all supporting elements of neural fibers, they may have Schwann cells, perineural cells, and blood vessels. Axon stains show the random distribution of individual axons in neurofibroma. Collagen fibers are interspersed among the spindle cells. Schwann cell is considered the main tumor cell, where both NF-1 alleles are lacking.

- **Plexiform neurofibroma:**They are thought to be the pathognomonic sign of the disease. Histologically, they show numerous elongated nerve bundles with an abundant myxoid matrix. They are often mixed with diffuse cutaneous neurofibromas involving the dermis and subcutaneous fat.

- **Cafe-au-lait macules:**Histologically, there is an increase in the melanin content of basal keratinocytes and melanocytes. There is also an increase in the number of melanocytes, along with an increase in the amount of melanin. Giant melanosomes or macro melanosomes have been reported.
