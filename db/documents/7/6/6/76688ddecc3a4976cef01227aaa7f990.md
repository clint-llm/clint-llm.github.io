The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a critical regulator of blood volume, electrolyte balance, and systemic vascular resistance. While the baroreceptor reflex responds short term to decreased arterial pressure, the RAAS is responsible for acute and chronic alterations. The classical understanding of RAAS is that it comprises three significant compounds: renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone.
