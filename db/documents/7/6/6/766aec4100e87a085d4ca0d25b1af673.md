Stress fractures, in general, may have complications. Though considered a low-risk area, complications may include:

- Non-union with possible need for surgery

- Deconditioning

- Cast complications to include skin breakdown

- Excessive bone callus formation that leads to chronic pain in the area

Patients with complications should have a referral to an orthopedist, podiatrist, or sports medicine specialist.
