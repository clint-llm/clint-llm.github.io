**Stages of Corneal Ulcer**

- Stage of progressive infiltration

- Stage of active ulceration

- Stage of regression

- Stage of cicatrization

**Infectious Keratitis**

Infection incites the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages. The hydrolases, proteases released by these inflammatory cells are primarily responsible for corneal stromal melt and necrosis.

**Adenoviral Keratoconjunctivitis**

- Stage 1- It lasts for 7 to 10 days and characterized by diffuse punctate epithelial keratitis.

- Stage 2- After 7 days, subepithelial to anterior stromal infiltrates appear. NK cells are the first to come in action and further involve cell-mediated immunity.

- Stage 3- This is characterized by persistent subepithelial to anterior stromal infiltrates.

**Onchocerca Volvulus Induced Keratitis**

Corneal infection by motile worms does not per se cause blindness; however, as they die after chemotherapy or naturally, they incite inflammation and cause corneal punctate opacification. Repeated episodes result in complete opacification of the cornea and result in blindness.

**Peripheral Ulcerative Keratitis**

Exact etiology is not clear; however, both cell-mediated and humoral immunity plays an important role. In response to a corneal antigen, the immune complex gets deposited in the peripheral cornea. The hypersensitivity reaction to an exogenous antigen is other described mechanisms.

**Xerophthalmia**

Vitamin A deficiency is needed for the maintenance and integrity of the epithelial lining of the ocular surface. Loss of epithelial lining with subsequent liquefactive necrosis of cornea results in keratomalacia.
