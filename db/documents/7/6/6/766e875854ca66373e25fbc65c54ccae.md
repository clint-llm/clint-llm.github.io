Teratogenicity is the most significant adverse effect of vitamin A toxicity. Patients should be advised not to ingest more than the recommended maximum amount of supplemental vitamin A during pregnancy. The majority of other adverse effects, including skin irritation, dryness, and increased intracranial pressure, will resolve once ingestion or application of vitamin A is reduced or discontinued. Effects such as elevated triglycerides, cholesterol, or transaminases typically resolve despite the ongoing continuation of the medication. However, these levels should be monitored, and the medication should be discontinued if elevations persist or worsen.
