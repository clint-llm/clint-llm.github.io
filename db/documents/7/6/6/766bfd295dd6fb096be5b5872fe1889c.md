**Intensive Lifestyle Intervention**

Lifestyle intervention represents the cornerstone of treatment for insulin resistance. Dietary intervention should include a combination of calorie restriction and reduction of high glycemic index carbohydrates.

Individuals with insulin resistance are at high risk of developing T2DM. The Diabetes Prevention Program and its Outcomes Study (DPP & DPPOS) demonstrated that lifestyle intervention was both a significant and cost-effective intervention for diabetes prevention in high-risk adults.

- A dietary therapy with sodium reduction, fat reduction, calorie restriction, and attention to the glycemic index of foods

- Education, support, and personalized programs

- A 7% weight loss reduced the onset of T2DM by 58%

- DPP included a metformin arm which reduced the onset of T2DM by 31%

**Specific Pharmacological Interventions for Blood Glucose Management**

While no medications are FDA approved for the treatment of insulin resistance, general approaches include the following:

- **Metformin:**This is considered first-line therapy for medication treatment of T2DM and is approved for use in polycystic ovary syndrome. The DPP/DPPO study showed that the addition of metformin and lifestyle interventions combined were medically useful and cost-effective. Despite the concerns of use in mild to moderate renal dysfunction, several organizations including the American Geriatric Society and the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines endorse use as long as the GFR is greater than 30.

- **Glucagon-like peptide one inhibitors:**The GLP-1 receptor agonists stimulate the GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas, thereby increasing insulin release and inhibiting glucagon secretion. Use of GLP-1 agonists is associated with weight loss, which may reduce IR. Liraglutide is FDA approved as and an anti-obesity agent.

- **Sodium-glucose cotransporter two inhibitors:**The SGLT2 inhibitors increase the excretion of urinary glucose, thereby reducing plasma glucose levels and exogenous insulin requirements. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors has also been associated with weight loss, which may reduce insulin resistance.

- **Thiazolidinediones:**TZDs improve insulin sensitivity by increasing insulin-dependent glucose disposal in muscle and adipose tissue as well as decreasing hepatic glucose output. Though effective, associated secondary weight gain and fluid retention, with associated cardiovascular concerns, limit their use.

- **Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors:**The DPP-4 inhibitors prolong the activity of endogenous GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide(GIP) by preventing their breakdown.

For individuals on insulin therapy:

- The use of concentrated insulin preparations when large doses (greater than 200 units per day) of insulin are required to improve tolerance and absorption. At this time U-500 and U-200 Lispro and U-300 Glargine

**Surgery**

Surgical intervention in the form of gastric sleeve, banding, and bypass is available for qualified individuals with obesity. The excess fat loss associated with bariatric surgery improves insulin sensitivity. The STAMPEDE trial has shown good evidence of the benefit of bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes.
