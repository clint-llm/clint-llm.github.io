Stage I disease has a favorable prognosis. Survival for stage I LCT was 98% and 91% at 1 and 5 years. Survival for stage I SCTs was 93% and 77% at 1 and 5 years. Studies support this favorable prognosis for stage I disease. In one report, 38 men were successfully treated with the excision of the primary tumor only. At the follow-up of 7 years, no one had metastatic disease. The conclusion is that patients with 1 or 0 high-risk features can be safely observed without retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Early RPLND may be beneficial in 2 or more high-risk features/stage IIa disease. The prognosis for metastatic SCSTs is poor. Even though prolonged survival is reported, the median survival is between 1 and 2 years.
