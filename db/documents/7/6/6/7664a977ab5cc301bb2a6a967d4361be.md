Sporotrichosis caused by s. schenckii occurs by inoculation of soil, plants, and organic matter contaminated with the fungus. Sporotrichosis typically presents as papules or pustules that form ulcerated nodules involving local lymphatics. Sporotrichosis is classified into cutaneous, pulmonary, and disseminated, with cutaneous being the most common form of the disease. Risk factors which increase the risk of disseminated disease include patients who are immunocompromised and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcohol use disorder, and diabetes mellitus. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of sporotrichosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of sporotrichosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of sporotrichosis.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient for sporotrichosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with sporotrichosis.
