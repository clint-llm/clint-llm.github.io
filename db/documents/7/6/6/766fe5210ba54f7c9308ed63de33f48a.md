Hormones secreted from the pituitary gland control blood pressure; growth; energy management; sex organs; thyroid glands; metabolism; some aspects of pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding; water/salt concentration at the kidneys; pain relief, and temperature regulation.

**Pituitary Gland Associated Diseases**

- Central diabetes insipidus (deficiency of vasopressin)

- Gigantism and acromegaly (excess of growth hormone)

- Hypothyroidism (deficiency of thyroid-stimulating hormone)

- Hyperpituitarism (increased secretion of hormones produced by the pituitary gland)

- Hypopituitarism (decreased secretion of hormones produced by the pituitary gland)

- Panhypopituitarism (decreased secretion of pituitary hormones)

**Pituitary Tumors**

- Pituitary adenomas, noncancerous tumors that occur in the pituitary gland.

**Dysfunction**

- The pituitary gland mediates the stress response, via the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.
