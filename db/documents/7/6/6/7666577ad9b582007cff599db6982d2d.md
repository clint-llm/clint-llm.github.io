Some points that one must recall about cortisol testing:

(a) Cortisol secretion exhibits a circadian rhythm.

(b) Cortisol concentrations increase during stress.

(c) The level of cortisol binding protein becomes increased in hyper-estrogenic states such as pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, and in certain hematological disorders; these cause an increase in serum cortisol levels to help maintain equilibrium between the bound and unbound state of cortisol. CBG may decrease in familial CBG deficiency, hypothyroidism, and protein deficiency states such as severe liver disease and nephrotic syndrome. Cortisol levels are also increased by drugs containing estrogen, synthetic glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, pregnancy, and decreased by drugs such as androgens and phenytoins.

Cortisol levels can be established by measurement of cortisol levels in serum/plasma, saliva, or urine. A 24-hour urine collection is required to measure cortisol levels successfully. Normal values range from 2 to 6 μg/24 hours in women and 3 to 10 μg/24 hours in men. Salivary cortisol is in equilibrium with free cortisol and can be employed in children as an alternative to serum measurement.
