Cor pulmonale is a Latin word that means "pulmonary heart," its definition varies, and presently, there is no consensual definition. Cor pulmonale can be defined as an alteration in the structure (e.g., hypertrophy or dilatation) and function of the right ventricle (RV) of the heart caused by a primary disorder of the respiratory system resulting in pulmonary hypertension. Right-sided heart failure secondary to left-sided heart failure, or congenital heart disease is not considered cor pulmonale. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of cor pulmonale and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of cor pulmonale.
- Describe the pathophysiology of cor pulmonale.
- Summarize the treatment options for cor pulmonale.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cor pulmonale.
