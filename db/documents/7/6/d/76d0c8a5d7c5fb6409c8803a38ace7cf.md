The pathophysiology associated with defecation can subdivide into the following three conditions: diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence.

**Diarrhea**

Diarrhea is an increase in stool frequency, liquidity, or volume.

- Secretory

- Osmotic

- Inflammatory

- Functional

Secretory diarrhea is caused either by decreased absorption or increased secretion of electrolytes and water by the intestinal epithelium; this commonly occurs in the setting of certain infections by certain bacteria like Vibrio cholerae or with certain malignancies that increase secretion such as a VIPoma or carcinoid tumor.

Osmotic diarrhea is characterized by a substance such as lactose or gluten drawing water into the bowel down the concentration gradient. This type of diarrhea will frequently occur in malabsorption syndromes such as lactose intolerance or celiac disease. It can also result from the ingestion of osmotically active substances like magnesium or sulfate, which are common ingredients in laxatives.

Osmotic and secretory diarrhea is distinguishable from one another by calculating the fecal osmotic gap.

Fecal osmotic gap = 290 – 2 * (stool sodium + stool potassium)

A high osmotic gap (greater than 125 mOsm/kg) is characteristic of osmotic diarrhea whereas a low osmotic gap (less than 50 mOsm/kg) is more indicative of a secretory type.

Inflammatory diarrhea will occur in inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis, as well as in certain invasive intestinal infections like Clostridium difficile or Shigella.

The most common form of functional diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome, which is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders. This syndrome is often considered a diagnosis of exclusion with the aid of Rome criteria.

**Constipation**

Constipation involves a decrease in defecation frequency, generally occurring 3 or fewer times per week. This can lead to hardening of the stool and straining when attempting defecation.

**Fecal Incontinence**

Fecal incontinence occurs most frequently in the elderly and is the inability to control the passage of stool.  It can be congenital, such as in the setting of spinal cord defects or anorectal malformations, or it can be an acquired condition, often associated with an injury occurring during labor or anorectal surgery.
