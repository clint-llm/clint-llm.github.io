HIV-1 associated opportunistic infections encompass a myriad of life-threatening infections seen in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus who are generally not on anti-retroviral therapy (ART). These infections typically affect patients with low CD4+ counts. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of the most commonly encountered HIV-1 associated opportunistic infections and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in the management of afflicted patients.

**Objectives:**
- Differentiate opportunistic infections according to the CD4+ levels in patients with human immunodeficiency virus. 
- Identify the signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus. 
- Explain the management of opportunistic infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with opportunistic infections concurrent with human immunodeficiency virus.
