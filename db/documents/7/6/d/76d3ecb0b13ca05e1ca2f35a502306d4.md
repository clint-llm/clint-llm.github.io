The superior mesenteric vein collects the majority of the venous blood from the jejunum and ileum. According to literature reviewing computed tomography scans of the mesenteric vascular relationships, within the first three 3 cm of their respective origins, the superior mesenteric vein lies lateral to the superior mesenteric artery on the right side. As it ascends, the superior mesenteric vein normally remains on the right side of the superior mesenteric artery. When located to the left of the artery, this can represent either midgut malrotation, a resultant adjacent tumor compression, or a transient phenomenon of a normally rotated midgut.

The superior mesenteric vein receives many tributaries to drain the various organs of the gastrointestinal system. The superior mesenteric vein drains a portion of the large intestine up to the splenic flexure via the right colic and middle colic veins. It also carries blood from the pancreas via the inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins, the transverse colon by means of the middle colic vein, the stomach via the right gastroepiploic vein, the appendix by the ileocolic vein, as well as the small intestine through various venous plexuses. The superior mesenteric vein continues to ascend superiorly, until it passes posteriorly to the neck of the pancreas and ultimately anastomoses with the splenic vein to form the portal vein. Via the portal vein, the blood from all of the gastrointestinal organs continues into the liver.
