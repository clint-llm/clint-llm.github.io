**Complications Related to PAC Placement**

1. Arrhythmias when the catheter is introduced into the cardiac chambers due to wall irritation.  2. Knotting of the catheter inside the cardiac chambers identified on chest radiography. 3. Misplacement due to the looping of the catheter in the right atrium or ventricle. 4. Valve rupture or endocardial injury.5. Pulmonary artery perforation, a grave complication that occurs due to balloon overinflation or perforation of the catheter tip. It presents as hemoptysis and requires urgent management. 6. Pulmonary infarction occurs if the catheter is left wedged for a prolonged duration of time or migration of the tip to distal branches. 7. Thromboembolism (less common now because of the use of heparin bonded catheters). 8. Air embolism is caused by open infusion ports and entry of air into the venous circulation. 9. Catheter-related bloodstream infections.

**Complications Related to CVC Placement**

1. Cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, venous or arterial vessel injury or rupture, bleeding, and hematoma formation. 2. Pneumothorax is more frequent with subclavian vein catheterization. 3. Venous air embolism, a fatal complication that occurs when the needle or catheter is left open. 4. Indwelling catheter-related bloodstream infections
