Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare hematologic neoplasm, and the exact incidence is unknown. Estimating blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm incidence is difficult due to changing nomenclature and lack of defining criteria before the 2008 WHO classification system. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm represents 0.7 percent of primary cutaneous skin malignancies.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm affects people of all races and geographic regions. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm has been reported in patients of all ages, but it is most prevalent in adults; most patients are older adults, with a median age of diagnosis of 65 to 67 years. There is a slight male predominance, with a male-to-female ratio of about 2.5:1.
