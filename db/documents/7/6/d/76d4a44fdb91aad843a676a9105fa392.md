Successful biofeedback training requires a great deal of motivation and participation. The individual must be able to communicate and comprehend and follow through with instructions. The proper modality must be chosen for the correct indication. For example, electromyography biofeedback is more commonly used for musculoskeletal conditions, while real-time ultrasound biofeedback can be used for pelvic floor dysfunction.
