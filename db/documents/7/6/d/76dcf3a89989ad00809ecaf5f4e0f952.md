**ABO and Rh Typing**

The patient's ABO grouping is performed by ascertaining concordance with both cell typing (forward grouping) and serum testing (reverse typing). Discrepancies noted, if any, should be resolved before proceeding with further pretransfusion testing. Blood requirement if urgent O group unit should be selected for crossmatching. Testing two samples collected at different times is required before finalizing the ABO typing report.

Rh D typing is performed by testing the recipient's red cells with anti-D sera. Weak D testing is not required in the RhD-negative samples unless the recipient is a neonate born to RhD negative mother.

**Antibody Screening**

These are serological tests designed to detect clinically significant antibodies to blood group antigens using an Indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). The recipient serum or plasma is incubated with a panel of red cells; usually, 2,3 or 4 (unpooled) cells with a known blood group antigen profile are used for antibody screening.

**Antibody identification**

If the screening is positive, the next step is to identify the specificity of the antibody and for which an extended panel of unpooled reagent red blood cells is used (11-20 cell panel). The method includes testing samples against a sufficient number of reagent red cells that lack or express a particular blood group antigen. The specificity of the antibody is determined based on the reactivity pattern of the antibody against the cell panel. Then probability calculation is performed, allowing a minimum requirement of the p-value of 0.05 to zero down on the antibody/antibodies. Additional testing strategies may be required, namely the use of enhancement media (albumin, polyethylene glycol, low ionic strength solution, or chemical/enzyme treatment of the panel cells to aid identification.

Antigen phenotyping: Whenever an antibody is identified in a patient, confirmation can be done by phenotyping the recipient for the corresponding antigen to confirm he is negative for that antigen. Antigen phenotyping also needs to be performed on the donor units to select negative units for the antibody identified in the patient or to give phenotype-matched blood as in thalassemia or pregnancy. The method used for phenotyping is similar to forward typing by using the particular antisera. In patients who have recently transfused red cells in the circulation that are interfering with phenotyping or the antigens for which commercial antisera are not available, as, in Dombrock, molecular genotyping may be utilized for ascertaining the phenotype.

**Compatibility Testing**

Immediate spin method: The recipient serum/plasma is mixed with saline-suspended donor cells (major crossmatch) and vice-versa (minor crossmatch) at room temperature. Immediate spin can be the only crossmatch method when the recipient does not have current or previously detected clinically significant antibodies.

Antiglobulin crossmatch: In the liquid phase, i.e., tube method, 2 to 5% saline-suspended red cells of the donor unit are mixed with recipient serum and incubated at 37 C for about 45 minutes and washed to remove unbound antibodies. The AHG serum is added to the remaining cell button after washing, centrifuged, and read for agglutination. This can also be done using CAT or solid-phase systems.

Computer / electronic crossmatch: In this method, the patient is screened for antibodies and entered into the electronic system, which contains all the donor units in the inventory with their phenotype reports. The system picks the compatible units for the particular patient and displays them from the inventory; compatibility may be verified by computer. Electronic crossmatch can be used as the sole method only after ensuring that the recipient has no clinically significant antibodies present historically or currently.

However, the validation of the system is to be done on-site. The system should recognize and correlate anti­ body detection results, compare previous records, concor­dant ABO on the recipient from at least two determinations, donor component and unit number, and ABO/Rh retype results, as well as have logic to alert the user to discrepancies between donor unit labeling and confirmatory test interpretation, and ABO incompatibilities between the recipient and the donor unit.
