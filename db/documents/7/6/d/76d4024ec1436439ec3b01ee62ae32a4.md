Hypercortisolism is a complex diagnosis, with nuanced treatment, and requires long term follow up. Therefore, given these characteristics, HCM invariably requires an interprofessional approach. Beyond the role of the patient’s PCP and the team of specialists, other members of the health care team including the nursing staff, clinical pharmacists, social workers, mental health specialists, and financial assistance professionals are often required and integral to the long term effective care and well-being of these patients.

The PCP is often the gatekeeper of this canopy of care, and when the likelihood of HCM is first recognized, the endocrinologist is generally the first specialty consultant sought. In the process of establishing the formal diagnosis depending on the unique clinical circumstances of the patient other specialists, including the radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians, general and neurosurgeons, often then join the treatment team. Depending on the comorbidities the patient has or develops in the course of the work up other specialists may be required to consult as well. The care of these patients often requires periodic interprofessional case discussion sessions where the various specialists and caregivers can discuss the various aspects and nuances of the ongoing investigative and treatment plan. This communication is particularly useful if contemplating surgical interventions and/or radiation therapy.

Medical management will require the services of a board-certified pharmacotherapy specialist (BCPS) who can review in detail the agents chosen, optimal dosing, verify that there are no significant drug-drug interactions, and help guide the medication approach to such complex cases in tandem with the clinician team. Nursing staff needs to be included in these consultations since they will be administering these drugs, and must be aware of the signs for which to watch regarding adverse events or potential drug interactions.

Patients requiring hospital admission for surgical or radiation treatment will also require evaluation by the hospital care teams, including anesthesiology, hospital nursing staff, clinical nutrition, social workers, physical rehabilitation, and mental health specialists if those specialties are not already part of the managed care plan.

Following definitive therapy, a structured long term follows up plan is required, and again, the primary care provider in close partnership with the endocrinologist and the primary surgeon are central parts of this interprofessional team process. Such follow-up plans need to include periodic evaluation to exclude the possibility of recurrent or persistent HCM, which then requires the development of a new management plan for that. All these examples exemplify the interprofessional team paradigm necessary for managing such involved cases for optimal results. [Level 5]

Available data used in the development of various professional society practice guidelines show that patients with HCM cared for in a structured interprofessional setting have the best outcomes. If such a system is not available in the setting where the patient initially received their diagnosis, then it would be best for the patient’s gatekeeper PCP to refer the patient to a location/center where these resources are available and in place. The potential morbidity and mortality attendant with sub-optimally managed HCM make this vital.
