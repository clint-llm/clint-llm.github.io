The differential diagnosis of polyhydramnios is broad and includes disease processes leading to rapid abdominal enlargements such as volume overload (cirrhosis, ascites, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, pre-eclampsia), chorioangioma, hematoma in placental abruption, or multiple gestations. An enlarging uterus may also result in symptoms of dyspnea, which is a common symptom during pregnancy and can be secondary to a venous thrombotic event such as pulmonary embolism, reactive airway disease or exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary condition, cardiac arrhythmia or pregnancy induce cardiomyopathy, musculoskeletal disorder, or infection. Edema of the extremities can also be seen in normal pregnancies, pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, varicose veins or venous insufficiency, or deep vein thromboses.
