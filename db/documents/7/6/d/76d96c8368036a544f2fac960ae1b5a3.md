Tocolysis is used in the setting of preterm labor. Preterm birth is delivery before 37 weeks gestation and after 20 weeks. To diagnose preterm labor, continued contractions happen during the gestational age range mentioned previously to produce cervical changes. Continued contractions are defined as greater than or equal to 4 contractions over 20 minutes. It is difficult to determine which patients undergoing preterm labor will progress to preterm delivery.

Tocolysis has also been used in the setting of external cephalic version, uterine tachysystole, and suspected fetal distress. For the external cephalic version, betamimetics are the most successful at increasing the rate of cephalic presentation and reducing the frequency of cesarean section.

Uterine tachysystole is defined as more than 5 contractions over 10 minutes averaged for 30 minutes.
