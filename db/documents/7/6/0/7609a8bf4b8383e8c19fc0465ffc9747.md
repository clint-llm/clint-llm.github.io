In the original CA 125  immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) test, the cut-off point for the upper limit of normal was arbitrarily set at 35 U/mL, wherein only 1 % of the healthy population had levels greater than 35 U/mL, and this reduced to 0.2 % of the healthy population when raising the cut-off point for the upper limit to 65 U/mL.

Patients who have completed treatment for ovarian cancer and appear to be clinically free of the tumor with elevations in CA 125 (>35 U/mL) almost always have a tumor in second-look surgery.

Other studies among postmenopausal women have shown the test to have a sensitivity between 69 to 87% and a specificity between 81 to 93%. In contrast, in premenopausal women, the sensitivity was between 50 to 74%, and the specificity was between 69 to 78%.
