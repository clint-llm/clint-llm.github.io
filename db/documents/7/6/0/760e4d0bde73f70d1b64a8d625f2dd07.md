Indications of endovascular therapyÂ in acute ischemic stroke are patients who present late. They are out of the window for intravenous recombinant-type tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) therapy, who have contraindications to IV rtPA therapy (e.g., recent surgery or coagulopathy), or who have failed IV rtPA therapy.

Outcomes are favorable in patients who receive thrombectomy and standard medical care within 6 to 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.
