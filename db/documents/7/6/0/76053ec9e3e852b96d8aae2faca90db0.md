The pathogenesis of this disease continues to be unclear, but many theories have been proffered in the literature, including an impairment in the ability of macrophages to clear secretions or an overproduction of surfactant dealing with a deficient clearance activity of macrophages.

The macrophages themselves are a potential contributing factor in the formation of the amorphous material upon dying. The theory of impaired macrophage function is sustained by the association of this disease to immunodeficiency diseases that cause dysfunction of macrophages. Moreover, reports of the presence of antibodies of immunoglobulin isotype G against granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in pulmonary proteinosis also exist.
