The history and physical exam should focus on determining the etiology of AKI and the timeline of progression. If the history points towards hypovolemia or hypotension, then the treatment is guided towards volume repletion. The physician needs to look for inciting events such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, which may have caused volume loss, or any over-the-counter drugs such as NSAIDs or other nephrotoxins. One of the important signs to look for on a physical exam is orthostatic vital signs since they are an important clue for hypovolemia and, in an appropriate clinical context, would guide treatment. History and physical are essential in AKI because, more often than not, labs are unable to provide a clear answer as to the etiology of AKI.
