Patients with diphenhydramine toxicity present with an extension of adverse effects and generally include CNS depression and anticholinergic symptoms. Patients that present with mild to moderate poisoning exhibit more anticholinergic symptoms, which include dry mucous membranes, disorientation, tachycardia, mydriasis, urinary retention, hyperthermia, and decreased bowel sounds. Patients with more severe toxicity may also have severe delirium, seizures, psychosis, hypotension, dystonic reactions, hallucinations, and cardiac arrhythmias (i.e., QT prolongation and QRS prolongation). In rare cases, there are reports of rhabdomyolysis and renal failure in patients with prolonged agitation, coma, or seizures.
