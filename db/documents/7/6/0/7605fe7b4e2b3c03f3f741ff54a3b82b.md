The recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve originates from the 6th pharyngeal arch along with the intrinsic musculature of the larynx, except for the cricothyroid muscle. The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve originates from the 4th pharyngeal arch along with the cricothyroid muscle. This developmental pattern elucidates why the cricothyroid muscle is the only muscle that receives innervation viaÂ the superior laryngeal nerve. The 4th and 6th pharyngeal arches contribute to the formation of the cartilages that are both vital to the structure and function of the larynx: thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid, cuneiform, and corniculate cartilages.
