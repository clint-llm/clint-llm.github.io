Various drug classes affect the serotonergic system in the CNS and peripherally, with distinct utility and side effects. There are several classes:

**Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine)**

These are the first line of medications in moderate to severe anxiety disorders and depressive disorders; they can also be used in other neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., eating disorders, obsessive and compulsive disorders) as adjunctive therapies. Furthermore, the mechanism of action is by blocking the major 5-HT down-regulating pre-synaptic reuptake channels (e.g., SLC6A4), increasing 5-HT concentration. Consequently, resetting the abnormal feedback loop of the patient's inter-neuronal synapses, targeting the hypothesized pathophysiology of low 5-HT concentration in patients' CNS and serum.

Side effects include headache, agitation or mild irritability, dyssomnia or sleepiness, nausea or constipation, dizziness, and sexual dysfunction (e.g., delayed ejaculation, absence of orgasm, decreased sense of pleasure). Hence, the patient education session should be thorough, covering several areas (check your facility's protocol). The starting dose will be sub-therapeutic for 1 to 2 weeks and then increase to the therapeutic dose. The reason is to decrease the severity and likelihood of experiencing any side effects mentioned above, which can be transiently experienced in the first two weeks. Secondly, the mood will be regulated in approximately four weeks, but that is not an indication to stop taking the medication.

Therefore, Patients that abruptly stop their medications without notifying the provider after 6 to 8 weeks of intake might have manifestations of serotonin discontinuation syndrome (i.e., increased anxiety similar to the pre-treatment levels or higher, myalgia and malaise, flu-like state, brain zaps which are an electricity-like sensation on their head), that is associated with low half-life SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine, fluvoxamine). The management is to reinitiate the treatment, and the symptoms will resolve in 1 to 3 days. On the other side, the risk of serotonin syndrome (check clinical significance section) is increased if a drug holiday period of 2 to 4 weeks is not taken between shifting from SSRIs to monoaminoxidase inhibitors.

Several studies have analyzed the association between initiation of SSRIs and suicidality.

**Monoaminoxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) (e.g., phenelzine, selegiline)**

MAOIs are a class used in resistant depressive disorders and anxiety disorders that fail to respond to SSRIs. The mechanism of action is by antagonism of monoaminoxidase, as it is one of the enzymes that degrade 5-HT. They cause both reversible and irreversible antagonism of this enzyme, which will result in less degradation of 5-HT and other adrenergic neurotransmitters within the synaptic cleft (e.g., norepinephrine, dopamine), alleviating the clinical manifestations.

The patients should understand that it takes 2 to 4 weeks for the drug to work, and there must be a drug holiday from SSRIs before the shift to MAOIs; once started, there will be a list of medications they cannot take (e.g., amphetamine, pseudoephedrine, john wart herb), as it has a wide range of drug-drug interactions leading to serotonin syndrome. Nonetheless, certain types of food and drinks should also be avoided (e.g., cheese, alcohol, pickles), as they contain quantities of tyramine which induces the release of norepinephrine, leading to a Hypertensive crisis.

**Tricyclic Anti-depressant (TCA) (e.g., desipramine, imipramine)**

This class was the first line of drugs for depressive and anxiety disorders; however, currently, it is used in resistant or atypical cases, secondary to its side effects profile. The mechanism of action is by pre-synaptically blocking 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake channels while post-synaptically blocking cholinergic and histamine receptors. As a result, the concentration of 5-HT is increased, alongside its effect on the other receptors' functionality, which sets the mechanism of each group of receptors' possible side effects.

The side effects are:

- Sedation and increase in weight (antihistamine)

- Atropine-like effect (anti-cholinergic)

- Refractory tachycardia with or without hypotension, arrhythmia (e.g., supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia) (norepinephrine agonism)

Therefore, patients should be educated that it takes around two weeks to work and that the physician should consult the list of side effects and drugs before initiation to prevent any drug interactions. There is a possibility of overdosing either intentionally (suicidal attempt) or secondary to the class's narrow therapeutic index. After hemodynamic stabilization, the management of an overdose is by activated charcoal (if in less than 2 hours), sodium bicarbonate, and benzodiazepines, while monitoring the patient's urinalysis and electrocardiogram (ECG).

**5-HT Receptors Agonist/Partial Agonist (e.g., zolmitriptan)**

This class is used in migraine episodes' management, and contraindication must be ruled out before initiation (e.g., uncommon migraine, hypertension, ischemic heart disease). The mechanism of action is by affecting different cortical nuclei, as post-synaptic 5-HT receptors when activated, may cause an excitatory or inhibitory effect on the post-synaptic cell. Therefore, maximizing the receptor's functionality in serotonin-deficient disorders will optimize the function of the systems requiring this neurotransmitter.
