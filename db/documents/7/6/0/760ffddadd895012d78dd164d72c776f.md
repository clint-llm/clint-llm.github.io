An interprofessional healthcare team, including the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, psychiatrist, or emergency department physician who prescribes risperidone, must follow the patient. Nurses and pharmacists also play a crucial role in patient monitoring and directing the administration of the drug. The drug has many adverse effects, of which the most important are weight gain, metabolic changes, and sedation. Unlike the older antipsychotics, tardive dyskinesia is less frequently seen with the newer atypical antipsychotics like risperidone.

Serious side effects of antipsychotic medications (like risperidone) can include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Although the pathogenesis of NMS is not clear, it is a life-threatening condition that can manifest with altered mental status, fever, "lead pipe" rigidity, and autonomic instability, including hypertension, tachypnea, and tachycardia. The use of risperidone has also been linked to a higher probability of cerebrovascular events in elderly patients with dementia, leading to an FDA warning about the use of this medication in the context of dementia-related psychosis. Studies have even shown an increase in all-cause mortality among the elderly with dementia who are on this medication.
