The clinician should monitor their blood pressure, heart rate, and liver function tests for patients who are on verapamil.

**Goals of Therapy**

- Blood pressure is an essential indicator of how the patient with confirmed hypertension is doing with verapamil. The ASCVD risk and comorbidities of the patient require an evaluation to evaluate the specific blood pressure goal for the patient.

- If the patient with confirmed hypertension has known cardiovascular disease or a 10-year ASCVD risk greater than or equal to 10%, then the recommended target blood pressure is less than 130/80 mm Hg - for patients without markers of increased ASCVD risk, a target blood pressure less than 130/80 is not a recommendation but is a reasonable goal.

**Special Populations**

- **Renal Impairment:**If repeated intravenous injections are necessary for therapy, monitor blood pressure, and PR readings

- **Liver Impairment (Cirrhosis):**Monitor ECG and reduce dose to:
- 20% in oral formulations
- 50% in intravenous formulations
