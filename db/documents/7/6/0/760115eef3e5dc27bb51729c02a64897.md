Spinal surgery for managing low back pain, lumbar radiculopathy, and lumbar spinal stenosis is a consideration after the failure of conservative treatments. Spinal surgery is the first-line treatment in more urgent/emergent conditions such as conus medullaris syndrome, cauda equina syndrome, cancer (primary/metastatic), osteomyelitis/discitis, epidural abscess, and trauma. The surgical technique and instrumentation implemented depend upon patient factors and the diagnosis requiring treatment.

Lumbar decompression is a technique used to relieve pain caused by a compressed nerve root(s). Two of the most common types of nerve root compression are lumbar central canal stenosis and lumbar radiculopathy, reviewed in the next section. Lumbar decompression comes in several forms, including microdiscectomy, foraminotomy, laminotomy, laminectomy, or a combination of these. Laminectomy (surgical removal of the laminae) is considered the standard surgical treatment for the management of lumbar spinal stenosis. If the decompression, as mentioned above, leads to iatrogenic instability, then a fusion is also performed.

Lumbar fusion is a common surgery used to manage discogenic/facetogenic low back pain, radiculopathy, and spinal deformity (scoliosis/spondylolisthesis). Several surgical approaches exist within two main categories, posterior and interbody fusion. The more traditional approach is a posterior spinal fusion implementing rods and pedicular screws. Limitations of this approach include the need for thecal sac and nerve root retraction along with iatrogenic injury of the paraspinal musculature. Interbody fusion involves placing an implant such as a cage or bone graft within the intervertebral space following a discectomy (removing the intervertebral disc).

Surgical approaches for interbody fusion are multiple (posterior, transforaminal, oblique, lateral, and anterior). Anterior spinal fusion avoids the canal and nerve roots but does introduce complications such as vascular injury and incisional hernia. There is limited comparative data that one approach is superior to another. Following fusion, chronic postoperative complications include pseudoarthrosis (failure of fusion) and adjacent segment degenerative disc disease above/below the fusion level.

Non-surgical treatment can include manipulation therapy and/or physical therapy. The decision regarding whether to use these methods will depend on how acute the injury is, patient compliance, and severity of symptoms.
