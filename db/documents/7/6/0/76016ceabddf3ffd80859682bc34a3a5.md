Treatment for IHE is usually conservative. The initial management of the patient involves withholding oral intake, intravenous fluids, correction of associated coagulopathy, and administration of proton pump inhibitors. A serial CT scan or contrast swallow study is needed for monitoring of clinical progress and resolution of hematoma. The patient is gradually allowed oral feeding as the symptoms improve. Medical and conservative treatment results in full recovery in most cases. Recurrent bleeding or increasing difficulty should raise suspicion for hematoma leakage or rupture into the esophageal lumen and expanding hematoma, respectively, and should be managed as an acute emergency with airway protection and hemodynamic resuscitation. Therapeutic angiography may become necessary in the case of recurrent massive hematemesis to stop bleeding and hematoma expansion with transarterial embolization. Surgery usually is associated with poor outcomes but may become necessary for those who do not respond to conservative therapy or have massive recurrent hemorrhage leading to hemodynamic instability or associated severe esophageal luminal obstruction or perforation.
