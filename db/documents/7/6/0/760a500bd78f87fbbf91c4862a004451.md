Complications of bruxism are wide-ranging. A stomatognathic breakdown will occur when occlusal forces of high intensity and duration overcome the body's adaptive capacity, and the consequences of bruxism will appear. To mentions some, tooth wear, tooth hypersensitivity, tooth mobility, pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or jaw musculature, temporal headache, and poor sleep. Indentation on the tongue's surface, the presence ofÂ linea alba along the biting plane of the buccal mucosa, and gingival recessions are also clinical signs of this habit.

Bruxism may be associated with other parafunctional activities such as cheek biting or lip biting. There will be hypertrophy of masseter muscle accompanied by tenderness or fatigue of masticatory muscles. Tenderness of the TMJ may manifest as otalgia.
