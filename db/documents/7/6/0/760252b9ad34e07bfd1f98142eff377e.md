Adiposis dolorosa is a rare disorder of multiple painful subcutaneous growths of adipose tissue. The diagnosis of adiposis dolorosa is made clinically and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The proposed criteria for the diagnosis includes chronic pain of the subcutaneous tissue for over 3 months in overweight patient or patient with obesity, though the criteria still need to be validated. The pain is often disabling and resistant to treatment. The disease is associated with weakness and psychiatric symptoms such as depression. Because of its rarity, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team of clinicians including specialists and specialty-trained nurses and pharmacists. If the diagnosis is delayed, it is associated with high morbidity. As such the clinical team should confirm the diagnosis as quickly as possible. The pharmacist should assist in considering treatment options and assuring compliance, and the specialty-trained nurse should assist with monitoring, coordinating follow up and with patient and family education.
