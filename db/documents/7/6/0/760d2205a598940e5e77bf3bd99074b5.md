**Clinical Presentations**

Hallmark triad comprised of back pain, fever, and neurological deterioration is observed only in 8 to 15% of cases.

Almost two-thirds present have back pain as the presenting symptom.****

**Four stages have been described in the natural history of the disease:**

- Stage 1 - Back pain, fever, or spine tenderness

- Stage 2 - Radicular pain and nuchal rigidity

- Stage 3 - Neurological deficits, and

- Stage 4 - Paralysis

Stage 4 is observed in roughly 34% of patients.

**Salient Red flags for SEA include:**

- Unexplained fever

- Neurological deficits

- Active infective pathology

**Major risk factors for SEA include:**

- Diabetes

- Intravenous drug use

- Indwelling vascular catheter

- Recent spinal intervention

- Immunosuppressant status

- Infective pathology elsewhere

A model-based study comprising age, fever, antimicrobial usage within 30 days, back/neck pain, and history of drug abuse showed an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.88.

Back pain alongside fever/risk factors and raised serum inflammatory markers can be used as an algorithmic approach for advocating contrast MRI study.
