The initial evaluation of trisomy 13 starts with fetal nuchal translucency (FNT) which, is done in weeks 11Â to 14 of gestation. As with other trisomies, the measurement typically appears greater or equal to 3.5mm.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT ) is possible using cell-free DNA in maternal plasma to differentiate trisomy 18 and 21 from 13; nonetheless, cost per value continues to support the use of invasive techniques.
