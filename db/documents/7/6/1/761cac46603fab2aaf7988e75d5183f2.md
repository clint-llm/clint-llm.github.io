Goiter is the enlargement of the thyroid gland. Nontoxic goiter is thyroid gland enlargement with no disturbance in the thyroid function. It is not due to inflammation or neoplasia. Abnormalities of iodine supplies or metabolism always lead to nontoxic goiter. The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones (Thyroxin/T4 and triiodothyronine/T3) in response to thyrotropic hormone (TSH) of the pituitary gland stimulation. They are important for body cells' metabolism. It also secretes the calcitonin hormone that has an important role in calcium metabolism. With decreased thyroid hormone production due to iodine deficiency as an example, TSH release will increase and this, in the long-term, will lead to thyroid follicles hyperplasia and as a result increase in thyroid gland size. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of nontoxic goiter and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of nontoxic goiter.
- Outline the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with potential nontoxic goiter.
- Explain treatment and management options available for nontoxic goiter.
- Review the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with nontoxic goiter.
