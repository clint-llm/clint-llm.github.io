A hip pointer is a contusion of the iliac crest and/or the greater trochanteric region of the femur following a direct impact or collision. The management of these injuries requires coordinated care between athletic trainers, clinical providers, and primary care and sports medicine specialists. The majority of these injuries improve with standard, first-line nonoperative management modalities. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of iliac crest contusion ("hip pointers") and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanisms of injury of hip pointers.
- Review the proper evaluation for iliac crest contusion injuries.
- Outline available treatment options for patients who present with iliac crest contusions.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients who present with a hip pointer injury.
