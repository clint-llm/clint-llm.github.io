Survival depends on the location of the aneurysm. Infected aortic aneurysms have generally poor outcomes, untreatedÂ aneurysms of the aorta are almost universally fatal. Indicators of poor outcomes are female sex, a presentation with hemodynamic instability and shock or fever at the time of surgery, immunosuppressed state, extensive involvement of the aorta, and peri-aortic areas.

Long-term outcomes are related to the type of procedure for treatment, but overall survival in patients who respond to medical therapy is good, and no long term disabilities are seen. Patients who have an inadequate clearance of infection, graft reinfections have a poor prognosis with nearly 100% mortality rate if graft remains in-situ.
