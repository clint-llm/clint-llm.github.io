**Sleep Staging**

The humble beginnings in sleep medicine started with a mere observation and description of various events occurring during sleep and wake. However, it was not until the development of the field of electrophysiology and the invention of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings by Hans Berger in the early part of the 20th century that we began to understand better the complexity of the brain mechanisms characterizing sleep and wake states. Sleep goes through structured and organized cycles through various stages.

The initial overnight sleep recordings were performed by Loomes and his colleagues as they faced the challenging task of describing typical sleep patterns in normal individuals. Several groups improvised this and, in turn, gave rise to the beginnings of sleep staging.

In 1968, a committee of experts chaired by Rechtschaffen and Kales established the rules for the scoring of sleep in normal human adults. From this coding, 5 sleep stages were identified: 1 REM stage and 4 NREM sleep stages. Each stage consists of a number of physiological variables, which tend to occur in concert. Subsequently, in 2004, a revision of the sleep scoring rules was commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)

**Macrostructure of Sleep**

Based on sleep macrostructure, sleep can be classified into 2 main stages: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Typically, as one goes to sleep, the low-voltage fast EEG pattern of wakefulness gradually gives way to slower frequencies, as NREM sleep goes from stage N1 (decrease in alpha) to stage N2 (spindles, K-complexes) to stage N3 (increasing amplitude and regularity of delta rhythm). Stage N3 is referred to as slow-wave sleep (SWS). SWS is interrupted by periods of rapid eye movement (REM, i.e., active or paradoxical) sleep. Polysomnography (PSG) is a multiparametric study that has been traditionally used to assess the architecture of sleep.

Sleep goes through multiple discrete cycles of NREM and REM sleep through any given night. In normal adults, each cycle lasts for about 90 to 120 minutes, and there are about 4 to 5 such cycles that occur during a normal 8 hour night sleep. The percentage of NREM sleep is maximum in the first part of the night, while REM sleep predominates in the second half.

Stage wake (W) is characterized by the presence of a predominant beta rhythm over the anterior leads, and there is a posterior progression to a posterior dominant alpha rhythm over the occipital regions. This anteroposterior progression is best observed with the eyes closed and is attenuated by eye-opening. Eye blinks are frequently observed in this stage which appear as conjugate eye movements consisting of 0.5 to 2 Hz. During the transition to drowsiness, one of the first things to appear is slow lateral eye movements typically less than 0.5 Hz, and there is greater prominence of alpha rhythm with intermittent beta rhythm.

Stage 1 (N1) is characterized typically by the disappearance of the alpha rhythm and appearance of roving eye movements, which are slow, conjugate, to and fro deflections usually lasting approximately 500 milliseconds. The EEG shows medium amplitude, mixed frequency predominantly of 4 to 7 Hz activity, and irregularly spaced bursts of slow waves. There is an appearance of vertex sharp transients (VST) which are defined as sharply contoured, bilateral synchronous waves with maximum amplitude over the central derivations, although children may show parietal dominance. The amplitude may vary on either side, and they usually last for fewer than 0.5 seconds. They are usually isolated and appear at irregular intervals both spontaneously as well as on the application of alerting stimuli. We also see the appearance of positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS), which are either mono or biphasic, positive, triangular waves most prominent in the occipital head regions. Alerting during N1 can lead to a brief recurrence of the alpha rhythm. EMG shows reduced muscle activity.

Stage 2 (N2) is characterized by the presence of bilaterally synchronous theta activity accompanied by sleep spindles or K-complexes, or both. K complexes are defined by the occurrence of a complex pattern of negative sharp wave immediately followed by a positive wave (V-shaped) standing out from the background EEG, lasting 0.5 seconds, and is most prominent in the fronto-central derivations. For arousal to be associated with the K complex, it should commence no more than 1 second after the termination of the K complex. Sleep spindles are defined as distinct 12 to 14 Hz waves having frequencies of 11 to 16 Hz (most commonly 12 to 14 Hz) with a duration of greater than equal to 0.5 seconds, usually maximal in amplitude in the central derivations.

Stage 3 (N3) is characterized by high amplitude, delta slowing in the range of 0.5 to 2 Hz with amplitudes of equal to 75 microV as measured over the fronto-central derivations. K-complexes and sleep spindles may be present, but POSTs are rare. Typically, N3 sleep is scored if slowing is seen in 20% of the epoch. N3 sleep occurs most frequently during the first one-third of the night, and clinically this can be important as NREM parasomnias such as sleepwalking and night terrors are typically seen during this period. Stage REM (R) is characterized by the presence of rapid eye movements (REM), which are conjugate, irregular, and sharply contoured eye movements with an initial phase deflection usually lasting less than 500 ms. We also see diminished EMG tone and is usually the lowest of the entire recording. Sawtooth waves are seen, which are described as drains of sharply contoured or triangular, often serrated waves of 2 to 6 Hz with maximal amplitude over the central derivations and often, but not always preceded by a burst of rapid eye movements. The threshold for arousal by auditory stimuli tends to be the highest during REM. Typically, the R stage of sleep is present predominantly in the last one-third of the night and is the period where the REM parasomnias such as nightmares are typically seen. Stage R can be further subdivided into a phasic REM and a tonic REM stage. The phasic REM stage is a sympathetically driven sleep state characterized by the presence of rapid eye movements, intermittent muscle twitches, and variations in breathing patterns. The tonic REM, on the other hand, is a parasympathetically driven sleep state and is characterized by the absence of rapid eye movements.

Traditional visual-stage scoring of PSG records has provided valuable descriptions of sleep macro-architectural abnormalities in a variety of sleep disorders. However, they do not provide information about the EEG frequency characteristics or rhythmicity that underlie sleep disturbances. Further, the underlying assumption in stage scoring algorithms is that sleep is a discontinuous and discretely bounded process, an assumption that has not been supported by recent data.

**Microstructural Analysis of Sleep**

Transient EEG phenomena lasting less than the scoring epoch (phasic events) have been described within the sleep recordings allowing identification of what is known as the microstructure of sleep.
