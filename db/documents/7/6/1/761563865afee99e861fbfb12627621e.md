Autoimmune encephalitis was classified in the past as paraneoplastic or non-paraneoplastic, depending on whether there are any identifiable tumor-associated antibodies. These paraneoplastic antibodies included anti-neuronal nuclear antibody type 1 (anti-Hu), anti-Ri, or Yo, etc. With a better understanding of the pathophysiology of different auto-immune encephalitis, the more nuanced way of classification is pathophysiologically based. The modern-day classification is to classify the immune encephalitis according to the targets of the antibodies. The classical paraneoplastic encephalitis, as named above, is mediated through a predominant T-cell mediated mechanism with cytotoxic T cells demonstrated in the pathological specimens. These immune responses are the result of molecular mimicry between the neuronal tissue antigen and tumor antigens. The antibodies themselves are not pathogenic. These antibodies direct their activity towards intracellular constituents. The other class of autoimmune encephalitis consists of antibodies directed against synaptic or cell-surface antigens such as anti-NMDAR, anti-GAD, anti-VGKC antibody-mediated encephalitides. These are real antibody or B-cell mediated autoimmune encephalitis with real pathogenic antibodies.
