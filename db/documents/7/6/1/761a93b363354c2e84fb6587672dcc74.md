In most cases, the diagnosis of vitiligo is very clear based on clinical findings but detailed history and examination are necessary for disease severity.

Important points of history that are helpful in the diagnosis of vitiligo include:

- Age at onset of lesions

- Factors or events that may cause the onset of vitiligo

- Symptoms associated with the lesions

- Progression or spread of lesions

- Changes observed in lesions over time

- Presence of concomitant diseases

- Current medications

- Occupational history/exposure to chemicals or radiation

- Family history of vitiligo and autoimmune diseases

Physical examination of vitiligo reveals these findings:

- Vitiligo manifest as depigmented macules or patches with a convex border without signs of inflammation with normal skin around.

- Macules are milky-white in color, well-demarcated with either round, oval, or linear in shape.

- Ranges in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters.

- Common sites are face, neck, dorsum of hands, scalp, and trunk. On the face, lesion favors perioral and periocular distribution.

- Lesions can also occur in areas that are subjected to trauma like knees and elbows.

- Koebnerization may occur in 20% to 60% of vitiligo patients.

- Signs of other associated diseases may also be present like Goiter, anemia, generalized wasting, premature grey hairs (leukonychia), alopecia areata and weakness,Â etc.
