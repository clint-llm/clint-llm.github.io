A paradoxical embolism is a rare event with high morbidity and mortality. An interprofessional team best manages the disorder because of the diverse manifestations.

Reliance on team members working together from different disciplines is vital in order to diagnose, treat, and minimize negative outcomes in patients with a paradoxical embolism. For example, strong ultrasound skills are needed in order to identify an intracardiac shunt. The utilization of a pharmacist is important to achieve proper anticoagulation and prevent the formation of blood clots. Nursing staff should be proactive in looking for adverse effects of anticoagulation as well as performing timely neurological checks. Suspicion for a shunt should be high in the presence of venous pathology and an arterial event. Patients need to be educated on the prevention of blood clots by avoiding a sedentary lifestyle, wearing compression stockings if they have varicose veins, and taking the oral anticoagulants as prescribed. Pharmacists review medications, check for interactions and provide patient and family education. Women who are on the birth control pill should discontinue smoking and remain physically active.

The team needs to communicate and work together to produce the best outcomes. [Level 5]
