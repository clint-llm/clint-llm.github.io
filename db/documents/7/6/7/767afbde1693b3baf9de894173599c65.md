The diagnosis and management of an ectopic pregnancy is made by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, radiologist, obstetrician and the nurse practitioner. No patient should be discharged home if an ectopic is suspected.

Ectopic pregnancies are a common gynecologic emergency that typically are impacting otherwise healthy individuals and can have significant morbidity and mortality. Continued improvement in the ultrasonographic evaluation of these patients will aid in decreasing the mortality that continues to be associated with ruptured ectopic pregnancies.
