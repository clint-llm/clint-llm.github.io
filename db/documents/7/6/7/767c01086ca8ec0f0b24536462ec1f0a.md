The deep veins of the leg are typically named in accordance with the artery and drain the lower extremity musculature. The superficial veins are responsible for draining the lower extremity cutaneous circulation. All of the superficial veins eventually drain into the saphenous system which empties into the common femoral vein in the proximal thigh. The femoral vein courses posterior to the femoral artery as it courses through the adductor canal.[8]

The primary lymphatic chain that drains the lower extremities and groin is the most medially located structure within the femoral triangle.
