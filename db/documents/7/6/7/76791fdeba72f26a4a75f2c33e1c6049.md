The radial artery is often the source for drawing blood gases, cannulation for placement of arterial lines, catheterizations, or as a harvested graft for patients undergoing coronary revascularization. Since the ulnar and radial artery form, an anastomosis with the formation of the deep and superficial volar arches, the blood supply to the hand remains intact if one of the arteries becomes occluded during a procedure. However, the risks associated with these procedures include ischemia distal to the radial artery puncture site and compromise to the limb. These complications may occur in cases where the patientâ€™s collateral circulation inadequately maintains perfusion.
