Colchicine has primarily anti-inflammatory properties. It disrupts cytoskeletal functions by inhibiting beta-tubulin polymerization into microtubules, preventing activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils associated with mediating some gout symptoms. Colchicine does not inhibit phagocytosis of uric acid crystals, but it does seem to prevent the release of an inflammatory glycoprotein from phagocytes. Colchicine blocks metaphase due to two separate anti-mitotic effects; disruption of mitotic spindle formation and disruption of the sol-gel formation. The toxic effects of colchicine are related to this anti-mitotic activity within proliferating tissue such as skin, hair, and bone marrow.

The mechanism of action of colchicine in the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever is less well understood; it may interfere with intracellular assembly of the inflammasome complex present in neutrophils and monocytes that mediate the activation or interleukin-1-beta.
