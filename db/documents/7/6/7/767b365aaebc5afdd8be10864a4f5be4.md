The gold standard for the evaluation of adult acquired flatfoot is weight-bearing radiographs. Radiographs are necessary in the anteroposterior, lateral, and hindfoot views. These views will assess the degree of arch collapse, particularly by measuring the lateral first tarsometatarsal angle, and forefoot abduction at the talonavicular joint. Talar head uncoverage can also be measured in the setting of stage IV disease by the lateral talonavicular angle. Lateral views of the foot can also display naviculocuneiform and first tarsometatarsal collapse. Arthritis should be carefully assessed on all radiographic films as this may have implications on treatment options.

MRI is typically not needed for evaluation of adult acquired flatfoot; however, it may be beneficial for some patients with ligamentous involvement that may alter surgical treatment planning; this is particularly relevant for patients with medial peritalar instability, who have improved functional outcomes with deltoid-spring ligament reconstruction.

Several studies indicate that ultrasound may be a useful modality in assessing the posterior tibial tendon when compared to the more time consuming and costly MRI. Results from an ultrasonographic evaluation of the posterior tibial tendon were equivalent to MRI in 87% to 94% of patients.
