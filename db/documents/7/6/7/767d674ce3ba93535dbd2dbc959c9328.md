Behcet disease was first described in 1937 by Hulusi Beh√ßet from Istanbul, who described three patients with oral and genital ulcerations, uveitis, and erythema nodosum. Other clinical features were identified later and were added to the disease spectrum. Behcet disease is an auto-inflammatory systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. It is characterized by mucocutaneous manifestations, including recurrent oral and genital ulcerations, ocular manifestations, especially chronic relapsing uveitis, and systemic vasculitis involving arteries and veins of all sizes. It is also known as Behcet syndrome and malignant aphthosis. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, presentation, and diagnosis of Behcet disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Behcet disease.
- Review the presentation of a patient with Behcet disease.
- Outline the management options available for Behcet disease.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with Behcet disease.
