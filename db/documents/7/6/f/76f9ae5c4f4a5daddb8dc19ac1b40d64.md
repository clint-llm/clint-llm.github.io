Complications associated with reflux esophagitis include:

- Esophagitis varies in severity. Patients with Grade C and D in LA classification are characterized by severe reflux. These patients have the lowest healing rate with PPIs. Patients with severe reflux esophagitis usually relapse after treatment and are more likely to develop Barrett esophagus. These patients should undergo endoscopy 8 to 10 weeks after PPI therapy to check on healing and assess for complications.

- Lower esophageal rings (Schatzki)- This complication correlates with reflux esophagitis. Dilatation is the mainstay of management, followed by PPI treatment.

- Barrett esophagus: This complication presents in 5% to 15% of patients with reflux esophagitis. It is more likely to occur in White male patients with severe reflux esophagitis, who have the symptoms for a longer duration, and are over the age of 50.

- Peptic stricture tends to occur in older patients who have reflux for a longer duration, with abnormal esophageal motility and not receiving treatment for the reflux symptoms.

- Esophageal adenocarcinoma (8 to 1 male to a female)

- Peptic ulceration, gastric cardia cancer, dysphagia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

- Other complications include anemia (due to chronic blood loss), laryngitis, cough, sinusitis, bronchial asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and dental erosions.
