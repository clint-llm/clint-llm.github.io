At the initial stage, pseudomyxoma peritonei is often asymptomatic or presents with non-specific signs and symptoms sometimes misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. As the disease progresses, patients may present with appendicitis-like symptoms, increased abdominal girth, the presence of pelvic masses or new-onset hernia. More advanced disease may result in abdominal distension, ascites, bowel obstruction, and nutritional compromise. Reports also exist of superinfected pseudomyxoma peritonei and subsequent sepsis.

Physical examination may reveal a distended abdomen with a palpable omental cake. A rectal exam may reveal deposits in the pouch of Douglas or the rectovesical pouch. Ovarian masses may be palpable in females.
