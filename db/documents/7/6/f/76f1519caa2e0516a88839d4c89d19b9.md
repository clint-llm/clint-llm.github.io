Typically, the pathogenesis of a prostatic abscess is due to suboptimally treated acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis. Infection of prostatic tissue occurs as a result of the reflux of infected urine into the prostatic ducts, or there may be direct contamination through a transrectal needle during a prostate biopsy. Inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis and systemic risk factors that promote infections result in acute/chronic bacterial prostatitis and/or a prostatic abscess. Other localized infections predisposing patients to a prostatic abscess include urinary tract infections, epididymitis, gonorrhea, and pyelonephritis.Staphylococcus aureus, could also lead to prostatic abscess formation.

Infrequently, an emphysematous prostatic abscess can develop from a urinary tract infection with gas-forming organisms, particularly in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Staphylococcus aureus.
