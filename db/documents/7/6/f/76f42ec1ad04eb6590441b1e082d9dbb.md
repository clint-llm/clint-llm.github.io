The diaphragm receives motor innervation from the phrenic nerve. Fibers from the C3-C5 cervical spinal nerves form the phrenic nerve. Sensory innervation of the diaphragm is two-fold. Sensory afferents are sent through the central portion of the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve and through the peripheral portion via the sixÂ most inferior intercostal nerves, T5-T11, and the subcostal nerve, T12. Injury to the phrenic nerve causes the diaphragm to lose the ability to contract. Due to the negative pressure within the thorax, the diaphragm will remain elevated and not be able to flatten on inspiration.

Harrison groove is not the result of a nerve injury; however, it has clinical application to determine the height of the diaphragm. If the phrenic nerve is injured and contraction of the diaphragm is impaired, then the Harrison groove can no longer be used as an approximation for the height of the diaphragm.
