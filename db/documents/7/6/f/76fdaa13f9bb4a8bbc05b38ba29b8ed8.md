Q fever is infrequently fatal, and no precise data exist on whether to screen pregnant women for infection during an outbreak. The mortality rate is 2.4%. Some authors strongly advocate serology monitoring after an episode of acute Q fever for two years for earlier detection of chronic Q fever or endocarditis. The reason for this is an increased risk (39%) of endocarditis in patients with valvular lesions. In such a population, a transthoracic screening echocardiogram can be done to detect endocarditis. If the echocardiogram is negative and the serological titers rise, additional tests such as PCR of blood and positron emission tomography to look for a focus of persistent infection may help.

Serological and drug-level monitoring is recommended during the treatment of endocarditis. If hydroxychloroquine is replaced by ciprofloxacin or rifampin, then the patient will need long-term serological follow-up. Biannual eye evaluation is a must when a patient is on hydroxychloroquine to monitor for visual deficits. Aneurysmal and vascular prosthetic device infections are associated with higher mortality. Patients with Q fever and persistent lymphadenopathy may need to undergo evaluation for lymphoma.
