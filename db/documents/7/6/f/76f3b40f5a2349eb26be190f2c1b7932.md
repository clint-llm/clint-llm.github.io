Edoxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that is FDA-approved and indicated for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), and to decrease the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The primary care clinician or specialist prescribing the drug should be up to date on the latest anticoagulation guidelines and the latest clinical trial studies on edoxaban and its indication and adverse effects. The care for patients with thromboembolic diseases prompts critical care from an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals as preventable ischemic events can lead to life-long permanent complications and mortality. These healthcare professionals include a primary care clinician, a hematologist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a nurse, and a pharmacist coordinating their activities and sharing information as a cohesive interprofessional team. This interprofessional approach will drive better patient outcomes and help to preclude adverse events. [Level 5]

The primary care clinicians and specialists should educate their patients about the consequences of non-compliance with anticoagulant therapy for the full duration and how subtherapeutic levels can further result in thromboembolism and ischemic complexities. Before initiating therapy, the prescribing physician should be aware of the kidney function and CrCL levels, as dosing modifications are required for CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min and contraindicated in CrCL <15 mL/min. Patients should receive information on the common adverse effects that may occur while on therapy with edoxaban, such as the risk of bleeding, rash, and anemia. Routine check-ups should be scheduled, and liver functions monitored routinely as edoxaban therapy may cause an elevation in liver enzymes.

Counseling and careful monitoring should be conducted during pregnancy, as clinical studies during its use in pregnancy are limited, and edoxaban is labeled as pregnancy category C. The clinician performing spinal or epidural puncture procedures should be aware of patients currently taking anticoagulants as there is a significant risk for spinal and epidural hematoma, which can cause life-long impairment. The patient should also be fully informed of no concurrent use with other hematologic agents as it may predispose the patient to an increased risk of pathological bleeding. Interprofessional communication is key to building patient rapport and developing a therapeutic alliance, so the patients comply with therapy adequately to prevent thromboembolism-related complications.
