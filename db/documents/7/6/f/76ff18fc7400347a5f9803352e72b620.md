While the Snellen chart is prized as a quick, low cost, and portable tool, there are several drawbacks to its use. These disadvantages, outlined below, gave birth to the improvements seen in newer charts, such as the ETDRS.

**Chart Design**

Every line of the chart contains a different number of characters, i.e., eight characters on the 20/20 line and only 1 letter on the 20/200 line.

**Language Barriers**

The use of the Snellen chart is limited to those patients familiar with the Roman alphabet and free of any other language, literacy, or verbal communication difficulties.

**Cognitive and Attentiveness Limitations**

Administering the Snellen chart test requires that the patient focus his/her attention for the duration of the test and cooperate by following the instructions given. For those patients who are unable to cooperate due a physical or mental disability or for pediatric patients, this test may prove challenging to administer.
