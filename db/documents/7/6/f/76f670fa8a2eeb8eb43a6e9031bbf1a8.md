Bowel ischemia can classify as small intestine ischemia, which is commonly known as mesenteric ischemia and large intestine ischemia, which generally referred to as colonic ischemia. Intestinal ischemia occurs when at least a 75% reduction in intestinal blood flow for more than 12 hours. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom in patients with intestinal ischemia. This activity describes the etiology, evaluation, and management of bowel ischemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
-  Identify the etiology and risk factors associated with bowel ischemia
- Outline the imaging options available to diagnose ischemic bowel.
- Summarize the treatment options of bowel ischemia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to treat bowel ischemia and improve outcomes.
