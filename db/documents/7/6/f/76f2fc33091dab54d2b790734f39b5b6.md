The deep peroneal nerve innervates muscles of the anterior leg compartment and the dorsum of the foot. It is also responsible for the sensation of the first interdigital cleft of the foot, or the space between the first and second digits. The nerve is derived from the common peroneal (fibular) nerve, which as part of the sciatic nerve originates from the dorsal branches of L4, L5, S1, and S2.
