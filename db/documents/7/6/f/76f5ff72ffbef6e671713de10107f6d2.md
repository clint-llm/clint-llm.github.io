Patients with rapid eye movement behavior disorder and their sleeping partners are prone to injuries during their sleep that can result in serious harm. The sleeping partner could target a violent dream enactment behavior leading to the patient being arrested on charges of domestic assault. Therapeutic management should include injury risk mitigation discussions with the patient and their sleeping partner.

It is ethically important to disclose potential risks for the development of neurodegenerative disease to patients diagnosed with RBD. An open discussion with family members offers an opportunity for improved understanding and avoiding misinformation about the disease process. It is recommended to counsel patients that Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative disorders can be treatable. The prompt diagnosis of RBD may provide an early therapeutic window for neuroprotective therapies. The International Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Study Group is conducting ongoing collaborative studies for symptomatic and neuroprotective treatment.
