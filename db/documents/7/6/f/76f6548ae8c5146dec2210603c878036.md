Several theories regarding the etiology and risk factors of CTEPH exist; however, more extensive trials are needed to establish a clear connection between these and the disease. Also, there is a significant overlap between risk factors of CTEPH, DVT, and acute pulmonary embolism. The patients at risk for CTEPH include recurrent embolic events, thrombophilias, immunological disorders, ventriculoatrial shunts, pacemakers, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC lines), malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, splenectomy, chronic osteomyelitis, right ventricular dysfunction, large arterial thrombi, diabetes, hypothyroidism, younger age, acute PE with more significant perfusion defect and idiopathic pulmonary embolism.
