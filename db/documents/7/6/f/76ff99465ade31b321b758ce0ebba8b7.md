Historically, pseudogenes were referred to as "junk DNA" due to their location in non-coding sequences of the genome.Â However, recent studies have begun to unravel various functions of pseudogenes and their mRNA transcripts. These functions vary in regulatory roles, and they include antisense RNA, siRNA, miRNA-like, and miRNA binding or inhibiting properties.
