The diaphragm is composed of the central tendon, costal, sternal, and lumbar components, the lateral parts of which are a continuation of the oblique muscles. At rest, it sits near the fifth and sixth intercostal space, and incompletely separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Its central location, in addition to movement during respiration, renders it a potential target in both thoracic and abdominal trauma. This activity reviews the workup of diaphragm injury and describes the role of health professionals working together to manage this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of diaphragm injury.
- Outline the treatment of diaphragm injury.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with diaphragm injury.
