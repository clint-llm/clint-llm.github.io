Vidian neurectomy is not a commonly performed procedure and is a treatment modality offered in cases of refractory rhinitis. Before embarking on this procedure, there needs to be a clear discussion with the patient in terms of their expectations and possible outcomes of the procedure. As any skull base procedure, this procedure involves a multidisciplinary team, which includes rhinologists, anesthetists, radiologists, ophthalmologists, the nursing team as well as other theatre staff.

The initial case evaluation occurs at the rhinology clinic, which allergy testing and endoscopic examination. CT scans require review for understanding the full course of the vidian nerve and pterygopalatine fossa. Intraoperative and postoperative optimization of the patient would need an expert neuro-anesthesia team effort. Finally, a postoperative follow-up would involve regular endoscopic examinations as well as ophthalmology clinic visits in case of dry eye.
