Dermatofibromas are benign lesions with excellent prognosis that are usually cured through surgical excision. In excisional biopsies with cellular or atypical variants, re-excision may be recommended to ensure clear margins because of the documented, albeit low, rate of local recurrence. Metastases are extremely rare but have been observed. No histopathologic appearance has been reliably indicated in which lesions will tend to recur or metastasize.
