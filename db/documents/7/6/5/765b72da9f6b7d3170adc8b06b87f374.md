Hereditary angioedema results from excessive production of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a vasodilator that causes the larynx to become engorged and swollen, threatening the airway. Due to this pathway, the swelling is not amenable to antihistamines as it is not a histamine-mediated process. While there are other forms of hereditary angioedema, deficiency or dysfunction in C1 inhibitor is the most common form. C1 inhibitor is an acute phase reactant and a serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins inhibit the steps in the lectin complement pathway as well as kinin-producing pathways. While C1 inhibitor has many functions, its function in the kinin pathway leads to angioedema.

While it is uncertain what causes the initial molecular events leading to this angioedema, it is believed activated factor XII of the coagulation cascade and kallikrein catalyze the cleavage of kininogen, which produces bradykinin. C1 inhibitor usually limits this bradykinin production by inhibiting kallikrein and factor XIIa. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator due to multifactorial downstream effects on the smooth muscle in blood vessels. This activity, in turn, leads to edema of surrounding tissues and, most importantly, the airway. In individuals with a deficiency of C1 inhibitor, this process proceeds unchecked and leads to gross vasodilation and angioedema.
