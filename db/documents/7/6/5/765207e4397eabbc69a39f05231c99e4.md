Low back pain and other degenerative spinal conditions can present with varying degrees of pain, disability, radiculopathy, and neurologic deficits. The clinical picture can be ambiguous for even skilled clinical practitioners.

In most presentations, facetogenic lumbosacral pain often presents secondary to chronic pain alone. It should, however, be noted that facet joint pain may be referred distally into the lower limb, thus mimicking sciatica. In these cases of "pseudo-radicular" lumbar pain, patients typically experience radiation into the unilateral or bilateral buttocks and the trochanteric region (from L4 and L5 levels), the groin and thighs (from L2 to L5), ending above the knee, and without any neurologic deficits. At times, pain may radiate further down the lower extremity reaching the foot, thus mimicking sciatic pain. This may occur especially in the setting of rather large synovial cysts causing direct mechanical compression and creating ensuing inflammation to further irritate the surrounding nerve roots.

In any case of low back pain, a physical examination is a key tool in determining etiology. The examination should begin with an inspection of the back to rule out any visible abnormalities. Palpation should be performed to evaluate for areas of palpable tenderness or paraspinal hypertonicity. Range of motion with active lumbosacral flexion and extension should be performed with the patient standing. While standing, lumbosacral facet loading should be performed, especially when low back pain is suspected of facetogenic etiology. This maneuver is performed by having the patient extend and rotate the spine. This increases pressure on the facet joints, thus eliciting a pain response. However, studies have shown that facet loading is unreliable in diagnosing facetogenic pain. Additionally, paraspinal muscle tenderness has been shown to be weakly associated with facetogenic pain, although this finding is considered to be non-specific.

Lower extremity muscle strength should be performed with hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion, big toe extension, and ankle plantarflexion to evaluate the L2-S1 myotomes. Light touch sensory examination should be performed throughout the L2-S1 lower extremity dermatomes. Patellar (L4) and Achilles (S1) reflexes should be elicited. Straight leg raise testing is then performed with the patient in a supine position. The examiner gently raises the patient's leg by flexing the hip with the knee in extension, with dorsiflexion as an added maneuver for test sensitivity. The test is considered positive, with pain elicited by hip flexion at an angle lower than 45 degrees, with pain typically reported as shooting down the leg.

A positive straight leg raise test may be useful in the workup of lumbar facetogenic pain, as a positive test may be more indicative of radiculopathy with disc herniation rather than facet dysfunction. While in the supine position, hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABERE) can be performed. This positioning stresses the sacroiliac joint and, if positive, can point away from facetogenic etiology of back pain. Hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) may also be performed, which indicates intraarticular hip pathology rather than lumbar facet joint pain.
