MRI in the clinical setting has improved patient care by offering a non-ionizing radiation alternative method of imaging. The value in not relying solely on standard X-ray based imaging techniques is best illustrated in cases requiring regular monitoring of disease progression, most notably multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. MRI also offers a lower-risk diagnostic evaluation for those who are at a high risk of long term radiation-related complications, such as children and pregnant women.

The alternative non-contrast techniques used in MRI are important for time-sensitive neurological imaging, for example, MR arteriography assists in the assessment of the craniocervical vasculature in suspected stroke patients with poor renal function or severe iodinated contrast allergies. In summary, the judicious use of MRI by ordering clinicians is critical for positive patient outcomes, timely diagnosis, and healthcare costs.
