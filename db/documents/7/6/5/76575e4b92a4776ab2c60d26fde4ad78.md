Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum or plasma potassium level above the upper limits of normal, usually greater than 5.0 mEq/L to 5.5 mEq/L. While mild hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, high potassium levels may cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or paralysis. Symptoms usually develop at higher levels, 6.5 mEq/L to 7 mEq/L, but the rate of change is more important than the numerical value. Patients with chronic hyperkalemia may be asymptomatic at increased levels, while patients with dramatic, acute potassium shifts may develop severe symptoms at lower ones. Infants have higher baseline levels than children and adults. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of hyperkalemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of hyperkalemia.
- Describe the effects of hyperkalemia on the ECG.
- Summarize the treatment options and order of treatment for hyperkalemia.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hyperkalemia.
