CABG is a mortality and morbidity saving surgical procedure in patients with severe three-vessel coronary artery disease or left main coronary artery disease. It requires a multidisciplinary approach, consisting of a cardiothoracic surgeon, cardiac anesthesia specialist, interventional cardiologist, non-interventional cardiologist, operative technician, nursing staff, pharmacist,  dietician, and physiotherapist to improve patient care.

Before the procedure, the patient should have an assessment by the cardiologist, cardiothoracic, and anesthesia teams, with a clear explanation of risks and benefits to patients. Postoperatively, patients should receive antiplatelet drugs, heart rate-controlling agents, and vasodilators, especially in patients with radial artery graft.

The radial artery graft is gaining popularity, especially in patients with contraindication of bilateral internal mammary graft. As guidelines are now emphasizing complete arterial revascularization, radial artery graft use will become more common. To improve cosmetic and clinical outcomes, minimally invasive techniques to harvest radial artery is in consideration.
