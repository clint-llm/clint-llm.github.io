- Claw toe - Over the years, there has been some confusion regarding the exact definition of hammertoes and claw toes in the literature. This is probably in part because its treatment path is usually the same, so the exact definition may not be of any clinical importance.Â Coughlin and Mann defined the distinguishing deformity to occur at the MTPJ.

- Most authors would agree with defining the claw toe as primarily a flexion deformity at the PIPJ and DIPJ with a simultaneous hyperextension at the MTPJ. Meanwhile, the hammertoe can be defined as a primary flexion deformity at the PIPJ but with a neutral or hyperextended DIPJ, with or without a hyperextended MTPJ.
