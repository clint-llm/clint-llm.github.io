Halitosis is classified into 2 groups: genuine and delusional halitosis.

**Delusional or Imaginary Halitosis**

- Pseudo halitosis: Here, the patient complains of having oral malodor, which others do not experience, including the clinician.

- Halitophobia: In this condition, the patient fears that his breath will be considered malodorous by everyone around him and will remain so despite treatment. This is a cause of great anxiety.

**Genuine Halitosis**

- 
Physiological halitosis

- 
Pathological halitosis

**Intraoral Causes
**

These account for nearly 80% to 85% of all halitosis cases.

A drop in the oxygen saturation of saliva results in a lowering of the pH of saliva, causing diamines to form, resulting in malodor.

**Extraoral Causes
**

Respiratory system: The nose, sinuses, tonsils, and upper respiratory system, including the pharynx and larynx, can be the focus of halitosis. Foreign bodies in the nose form a nidus for bacteria to thrive.Klebsiella ozaenae can cause atrophic rhinitis, Streptococcus species is responsible for acute pharyngitis and sinusitis, and nasopharyngeal abscesses and laryngeal carcinoma can cause halitosis. Acute and chronic tonsillitis and tonsilloliths contribute to halitosis as the tonsils, like the surface of the tongue, have crypts that house bacteria producing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) and, consequently, malodor.Pseudomonas aeruginosa in certain respiratory system diseases excretes 2-amino acetophenone, which causes halitosis.

Gastrointestinal system: Gastrointestinal (GI) causes account for most of the extraoral causes of halitosis.Enterococcus faecalis and Helicobacter pylori have been found in periodontal spaces and can cause halitosis.

Systemic/metabolic/endocrine disorders: Certain endocrinological and metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus render a fruity or acetone-like odor to the breath, while in uremia, the breath gets an ammoniacal odor. Likewise, some other medical disorders altering the odor of the breath are listed below.

- Acute febrile illness

- Upper respiratory tract infection

- Cystic fibrosis

- Diabetes mellitus

- Leukemia

- Hepatic failure

- Renal failure

- Menstruation

Drug-related halitosis: Certain drugs like chloral hydrate, disulfiram, acetaminophen, phenothiazines, antihistaminics, ethyl alcohol, griseofulvin, amphetamines, arsenic salts, bisphosphonates, chemotherapeutic agents, among others, cause oral malodor.
