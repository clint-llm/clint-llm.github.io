Myotonia is, by definition, the impairment of relaxation of skeletal muscles after voluntary contraction or electrical stimulation. Many etiologies result in myotonia, including dystrophic and non-dystrophic myotonias. Myotonic dystrophies are among the more common muscular dystrophies, while the non-dystrophic myotonias can be quite rare and thus frequently misdiagnosed.
