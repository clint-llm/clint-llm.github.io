Tilaux fractures are often first seen in the emergency department. However, clinicians including nurses who work in the ED should be aware of the current treatment guidelines. The amount of displacement drives proper treatment of a Tillaux fracture. Ideally, with little displacement, the fracture can be managed non-operatively with the application of a short leg cast with the ankle slightly inverted to help hold the fracture in place. Fractures that are displaced and disrupt the articular surface of the distal tibia need to be considered for possible operative management. An orthopedic consult is recommended to ensure that the proper treatment is being undertaken.

In most patients, rehabilitation is required to recover strength and function. The outcomes in most patients are excellent.
