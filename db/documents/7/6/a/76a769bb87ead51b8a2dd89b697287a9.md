HIV infections are still occurring daily in every population in the United States.Â To end this epidemic, every healthcare provider in every specialty should be prepared to offer relevant HIV prevention methods to their patients. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the newest addition to the established primary HIV prevention tools such as condom use, reducing community viral load through antiretroviral therapy, and syringe exchange programs. Post-exposure prophylaxis and prenatal surveillance are other established methods.

PrEP uptake among healthcare providers is an important focus of the HIV prevention campaign. The CDC recommends discussing PrEP with all sexually active adolescents and adults, especially young MSM, sexually active heterosexuals, and those that inject drugs. PrEP should be prescribed to all patients who request it. HIV prevention should be an integrated component of every healthcare practice. Despite better treatment options, HIV remains a serious disease that deserves the attention of the healthcare community and an effort to prevent every infection possible.
