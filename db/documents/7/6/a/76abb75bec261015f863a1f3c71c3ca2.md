An intracranial epidermoid cyst is a rare congenital cyst that appears as lobulated lesions that fill and enlarge cerebrospinal fluid spaces and have the same density as cerebrospinal fluid on CT. On skull CT, Langerhans cell histiocytosis presents as solitary or multiple punched-out lytic lesions devoid of a sclerotic rim; "beveled edges" or "button sequestrum" may be observed due to the involvement of inner and outer tables.

Osteomyelitis is characterized by focal bone lysis, cortical loss, periosteal thickening, and endosteal scalloping on plain radiographs. Depending on the underlying malignancy, calvarial metastasis manifests as either a lytic or sclerotic lesion; occasionally, mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions are observed. Metastatic lesions of the skull are frequently multiple; however, a single metastatic lesion may also be present.

Cephaloceles are congenital herniations of intracranial structures resulting from a skull defect.
