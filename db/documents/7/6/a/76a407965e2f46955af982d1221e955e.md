Complications subdivide into acute and chronic. Acute complications are upper airway obstruction and asphyxia, Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, infection, and death. Chronic complications are vocal cord paralysis, hoarseness, recurrent granulation formation, supraglottic stenosis, glottic stenosis, subglottic or tracheal stenosis, Recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction, and chronic aspiration.

Most patients achieve decannulation and stable airway without stenosis or granulation tissue.
