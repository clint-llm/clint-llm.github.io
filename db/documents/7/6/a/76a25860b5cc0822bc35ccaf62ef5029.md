Cobalt toxicity most commonly will be in the setting of a metal-on-metal arthroplasty or the occupational environment. It is essential to wear appropriate personal protective equipment and follow workplace guidelines to minimize exposure to cobalt and tungsten carbide powders and debris.

Decreasing exposure will ultimately reduce the risk of the development of disease. If you have a metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty, be sure to discuss concerns with your surgeon, particularly if you begin to have new pain, swelling, or difficulty walking, as this may put you at a higher risk of developing toxicity from the implant.
