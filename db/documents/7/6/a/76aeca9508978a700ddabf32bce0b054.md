Factor V is converted to activated factor V by activated factor X and thrombin. Activated factor X and thrombin have proteolytic activity on factor V and removes a domain from factor V, converting it to activated factor V. Activated factor X is another factor upstream from factor V in the coagulation cascade. Thrombin is a downstream product of activated factor V and activated factor X activity and acts in a positive feedback manner to further increase the production of itself. Activated factor V is a cofactor for factor X, and together, these two factors bind to form a prothrombinase complex that cleaves prothrombin to thrombin.

Activated factor V is cleaved and altered by aPC, which has proteolytic activity, cleaving activated factor V at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg 679,

APC will also modify Arg506 of factor V before it has been cleaved to activated factor V, which converts it to an anticoagulant protein, factor Vac. Factor Vac acts as a cofactor for aPC, along with protein S, to allow aPC to degrade activated factor VIII (Duga). Activated factor VIII is an activated factor in the coagulation cascade. The degradation of activated factor VIII causes a decrease in coagulation. Since aPC must undergo activation by factor Vac cofactor
