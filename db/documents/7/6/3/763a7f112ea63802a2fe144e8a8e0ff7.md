Penile cancer is a malignancy that is rare in Western civilization. It accounts for less than 1% of cancers in men in the United States, with approximately 2300 new cases and 400 deaths annually. It is more common in less developed areas of the world, such as Africa, Asia, and South America. In these areas, penile cancer can account for up to 10% to 20% of all malignancies in men. The increased risk in these areas may be due to differences in hygiene practices and increased numbers of uncircumcised males.

According to a study of incidence trends by Barnholtz-Sloan et al., the overall incidence of penile cancer has decreased in the United States over the last 3 decades of the 20th century. Interestingly, the National Cancer Database found that between 1998 to 2012, cases of all stages of squamous penile cancer increased with a greater proportion of advanced cases over time.

The disease is associated with older age, and rates are seen to increase with age. The mean age of diagnosis is approximately 60 years old.
