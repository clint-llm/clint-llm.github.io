Dermoid cysts have the potential to grow over time and extend intracranially or intraspinally.

Midline dermoid cysts have the highest association with cranial or spinal dysraphism or have an intracranial extension.

Dermoid cysts under an ultrasound will show a well-defined homogenous and hypoechoic cystic lesion.
