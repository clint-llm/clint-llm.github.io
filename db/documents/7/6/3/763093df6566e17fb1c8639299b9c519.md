Tumors around the optic chiasm, leading to bitemporal hemianopsia, are difficult to resect given the limited area and proximity of critical nervous and neurovascular structures. Associated cranial nerve deficits can occur in as many as 56% of cases and even end in mortality in up to 9% of resection surgeries.

Other less invasive options include stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as a promising alternative with a lower risk of complications.
