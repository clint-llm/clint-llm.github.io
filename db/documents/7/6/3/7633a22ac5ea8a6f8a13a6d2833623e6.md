Although mastoiditis can occur at any age, the majority of patients are less than two years of age, with a median age of 12 months. In the pre-antibiotic era, 20% of cases of acute otitis media were complicated by acute mastoiditis and frequently associated with severe intracranial complications.

With the advent of antibiotics, mastoidectomy, and PCV-7 by 2008, the incidence has fallen drastically. Specifically, before the antibiotic era, 5 to 10% of children with acute otitis media developed coalescent mastoiditis with a mortality rate of 2/100000 population. After antibiotics and pneumococcal vaccination (PCV-7), 0.002% of children with acute otitis media progress too acute coalescent mastoiditis with a mortality rate of less than 0.01 per 100000 population.
