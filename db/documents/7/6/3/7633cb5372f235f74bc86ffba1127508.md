The prognosis is based on several factors. Inferior wall myocardial infarctions complicated by RVMI have a worse prognosis than either alone. If patients have do not have RV failure, the in-hospital 30-day mortality rate was 4.4% with thrombolytic therapy and 3.2% with PCI. This increases to 13% for thrombolysis and 8.3% for PCI in patients with RV failure. In patients with cardiogenic shock, mortality increases to 100% with thrombolysis and 44% with PCI.
