As bladder injuries are relatively uncommon, they can be missed due to inappropriate imaging. A common strategy for performing cystography is to clamp the Foley catheter and allow the bladder to fill passively before a CT scan. This practice is discouraged by the EAST guideline on bladder trauma because the bladder may not reliably distend with variation in urine production.
