BPPV is among the most common inner ear disorders that cause dizziness or vertigo.

These otoliths move due to gravity as the head is turning and cause inappropriate signaling that the head is moving when, in reality, it is not. When the vestibular apparatus, semicircular canals, and visual system are in disequilibrium, it elicits the sensation of dizziness. The classic symptoms of BPPV often involve brief episodes of rotational vertigo that are reproducible.

The most common cause of BPPV is primary or ”idiopathic” as BPPV itself is often found in isolation. However, other inner ear pathologies such as Meniere disease and even migraines have links to BPPV.
