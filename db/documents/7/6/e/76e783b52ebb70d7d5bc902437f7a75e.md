Complications from PVS are common and include peritoneal infection, variceal bleeding, superior vena cava thrombosis, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), scar tissue formation, shunt fracture, occlusion, displacement or leakage, pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum. The most common complication of PVS is shunt occlusion, with only 18.6% of shunts remaining patent at two years, according to a study.

About 9% of the patients report with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after shunt insertion.
