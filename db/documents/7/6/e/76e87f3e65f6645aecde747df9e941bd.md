Bladder exstrophy is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a spectrum of anomalies involving the ventral body wall, urinary tract, genitalia, bony pelvis, spine, anus, etc. Its diagnosis is clinical and does not require any additional investigations. Precise surgery to provide acceptable continence rates remains the greatest challenge for pediatric surgeons. This activity outlines the etiology, pathogenesis, approaches for surgical management, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline various theories for the etiology of bladder exstrophy.
- Describe the evaluation of patients with exstrophy.
- Summarize the common approaches of surgical management of bladder exstrophy.
