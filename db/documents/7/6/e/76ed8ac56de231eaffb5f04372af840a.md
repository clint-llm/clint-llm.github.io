Histologically, florid vascular proliferation demonstrates granulation tissue-type florid proliferation of small vascular channels in a lobular arrangement. The vascular channels' lining is plump endothelial cells involving the entire thickness of the bowel wall, expanding from the submucosa to subserosal connective tissue. The endothelial cells have mildÂ nuclear atypia with few to no mitosis. The overlying mucosa of the lesion demonstrates ulceration with ischemic-type changes and some features of mucosal prolapse with underlying fibrosis.
