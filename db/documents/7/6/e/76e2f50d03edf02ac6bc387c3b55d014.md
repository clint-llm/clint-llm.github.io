The etiology of parasomnias remains conjecture, as no specific origin has been clearly delineated; however, a plethora of theoriesÂ have surfaced. Regarding NREM sleep disturbances, recent evidence suggests that disruptions of stage 3 slow-wave sleep can increase one's diathesis. Such conditions that can fragment slow-wave sleep include genetic susceptibility, restless leg syndrome, sleep deprivation, periodic limb movements, noise, sleep-related breathing disorders, touch, alcohol, stress, medications, and fever.
