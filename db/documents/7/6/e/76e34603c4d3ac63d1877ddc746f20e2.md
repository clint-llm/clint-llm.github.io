Although lymph node dissection is an important part of cancer assessment and treatment, as with any other surgical procedure, complications can occur. Complications depend on the site and extent of the dissection.

Depending on the type of surgery and lymph node dissection, various other complications may occur. Pancreatic fistula, hemorrhage, bile duct injury, and chylous fistula are complications specifically related to lymph node dissection performed in gastric cancer surgical operations.

Complications specifically related to axillary lymph node dissection include lymphedema, paresthesia, seroma, lymphocele, hematoma, lymphatic fibrosis, and axillary vein thrombosis.
