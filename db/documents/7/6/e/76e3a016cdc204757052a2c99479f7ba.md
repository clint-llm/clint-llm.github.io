When suspecting C1 esterase deficiency, key historical findings such as a family history for the disease or upper airway swelling may be noted. Additionally, a history of unexplained recurrent episodes of self-limited colicky abdominal pain may be present. History of angioedema without urticaria, pruritus, ACE inhibitor, NSAID, or allergic exposure is highly suggestive as well. Common sites that are affected include the hands and feet as well.
