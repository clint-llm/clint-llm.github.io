Malignant neoplasms after transplantation have different clinical features that are responsible for higher mortality. The Israel Penn International Transplant Tumor Registry showed that the stage-specific survival for cancer of colon, lung, breast, prostate, and bladder, was lower in patients after solid organ transplant compared with those without it. The 1-year adjusted survival of recipients with colorectal, prostate and non-small-cell lung cancer were 10%, 40%, and 20%, respectively, compared with 40%, 80%, and 30% in the general population.
