Significant complications are likely if patients opt-out from surgery or are not surgical candidates. These patients may suffer from increased pain, swelling, neurovascular entrapment leading to ischemia and paresthesias, and cosmetic distortion of the body habitus. If patients elect for surgery, they are at risk for surgical complications, including but not limited to nerve damage, vascular ligation, and respiratory compromise. Postoperatively patients require pain management and pulmonary supportive care. The morbidity and mortality are relative to the depth and extent of invasion, as well as the underlying natural etiology of the tumor. Cell type is important and influences oncologic outcomes and overall survival; the recurrence rates remain high with more aggressive histology.
