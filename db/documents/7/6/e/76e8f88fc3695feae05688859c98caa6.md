TTF has been studied for several solid organ malignancies and has received approval for use in primary and recurrent glioblastoma alone and in combination with other adjuvant therapies. The indications for the use of TTF and the current evidence are summarized below.

**Glioblastoma**

Glioblastoma is the most dangerous primary malignant brain tumor and has the worst prognosis. It is also the most common primary brain malignancy with an incidence rate of 3.2 to 4.5 per 100,000 individuals.

TTF has emerged as a potential treatment option in glioblastoma due to its locally invasive nature and decreased propensity to metastasize to distant organs facilitating maximum coverage of the tumor-containing region. TTF was approved by the FDA for use in recurrent glioblastoma in 2011, followed by newly diagnosed glioblastoma in 2015. The median progression-free survival increased from 4 months to 7.1 months, while the median overall survival increased from 16 months to 20.9 months with the addition of TTF to maintenance temozolomide in a randomized clinical trial by Stupp et al. in 2017.

**Pancreatic Cancer**

The utility of TTF is also being studied in pancreatic cancer, particularly advanced-stage carcinomas, due to its antiproliferative effects in preclinical trials. The replicability of these effects is being studied in an ongoing clinical trial, PANOVA, in which patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma received either TTF along with gemcitabine or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.

**Ovarian Cancer**

TTF has also gained popularity in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer, and one such trial, INNOVATE, focuses on the safety and feasibility of TTF in combination with paclitaxel.

**Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma**

The efficacy of TTF has been shown in animal models of advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma. Human studies have demonstrated the safety of the treatment, but its efficacy is still under evaluation. Ongoing LUNAR phase III trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of TTF with docetaxel in non-small cell lung carcinoma.

**Malignant Mesothelioma**

The use of TTF in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin in unresectable or metastatic mesothelioma has been FDA approved as the first-line treatment. A chest applicator has been developed to deliver TTF to the thoracic cavity. The side effects include mild to moderate dermatitis in about half of the patients.

**Future Role of TTF**

It is being evaluated in preclinical studies in several other malignancies, including breast carcinoma, urogenital malignancies, renal carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Another avenue of further development is dose and delivery optimization which may further increase the list of indications. Long-term adverse effects and the impact of alternating electric fields on healthy tissue are also a matter of further research.
