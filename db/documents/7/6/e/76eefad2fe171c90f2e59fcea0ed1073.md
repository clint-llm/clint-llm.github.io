**Complete Blood Count**

This test can be carried out on an automated hematology analyzer. Red cell counts are usually raised. Microcytic hypochromic anemia is found in thalassemias, except for asymptomatic carriers.

If leucocytosis occurs, it may signify an acute infection. However, for unknown reasons, many individuals with thalassemia can have elevated neutrophil counts. Iron deficiency anemia must be ruled out before diagnosing thalassemia.

**Iron Studies**

Normal or slightly increased ferritin levels areÂ present in thalassemia. Transferrin levels are almost normal in thalassemia as compared to iron deficiency anemia.

**Peripheral Smear**

Peripheral smear shows microcytic hypochromic anemia with target cells, teardrops, and cells with basophilic stipplings.

**Haemoglobin Analysis**

Automated high-performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis systems are precise and sensitive methods for quantitative and qualitative analyses of Haemoglobin in RBCs.

**Molecular Testing**

About 200 mutations causing beta thalassemia have been reported, and the most common among them is point mutation.
