Prognosis is dependent on the histologic type, advanced stage, and grade, spread of mucin beyond the RLQ as well as the presence of cellular mucin.

The specific histopathologic subtype of appendiceal cancer dictates the predicted survival and overall prognosis. Accordingly, goblet cell carcinomas, which share the biologic features of both adenocarcinomas and appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors, harbor a more favorable prognosis in comparison with adenocarcinoma. However, the overall prognosis of these tumors is less favorable in comparison with the appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors.

The risk of early-onset perforation within a specific histopathologic subtype of appendiceal cancer, including appendiceal adenocarcinoma, does not necessarily correlate with the overall prognosis.
