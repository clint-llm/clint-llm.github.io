The management of orchitis is usually on an outpatient basis; severe complications are rare. The condition still merits the involvement of an interprofessional healthcare team. However, several measures can help improve the outcomes and prevent the disease.

A study conducted in England and Wales concluded that vaccination with MMR provides significantly greater protection against hospitalization and risk of orchitis in diagnosed cases of mumps.

Another study showed that in general practice, patients presenting with symptoms of orchitis do not usually receive testing for sexually transmitted infections.

In Europe and the U.S.A, the isolates of Escherichia coli are becoming increasingly resistant to ciprofloxacin, which requires finding alternatives with sufficient penetration into testis for efficient and comprehensive management of orchitis.

Urodynamic studies should only be for patients with suspicion of urinary tract obstruction.

Urology nurses are involved in the administration of treatment, patient education, and reporting back to the team. Pharmacists check medication dosage, interactions, assist the clinician with antimicrobial therapy selection, and also provide patient education. These types of interprofessional team collaboration can improve patient outcomes in cases of orchitis. [Level 5]
