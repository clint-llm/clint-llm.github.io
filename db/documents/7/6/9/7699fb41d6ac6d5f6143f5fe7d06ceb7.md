The brachial artery divides into two branches, ulnar and radial artery, opposite to the neck of the radius. The radial artery is smaller in diameter as compared to the ulnar artery. At the lateral side of the carpus, the artery turns backward, and underneath tendons of extensor pollicis longus and flexor pollicis longus, it runs towards the first and second metatarsal space. The artery reaches the palm of the hand while crossing between two first dorsal interosseous muscle. The radial artery makes a deep palmar arch by combining it with the superficial volar branch of the ulnar artery.

At the forearm, the radial artery branches to the recurrent radial artery. It gives off a volar carpal branch at the wrist, and at the hand, it gives superficial volar carpal branch. Histologically, the medial layer of the radial artery is mostly muscular, making it prone to spasm. The muscular segments of both the radial artery and the internal mammary artery are similar.

The radial artery is particularly prone to spasm, possibly because of its large medial cross-sectional area. Adaptation to high arterial pressure, diameter similar to coronary arteries, length suitable for all coronary arteries, and harvesting without ambulation make radial artery graft preferable to saphenous vein graft in terms of both morbidity and mortality.
