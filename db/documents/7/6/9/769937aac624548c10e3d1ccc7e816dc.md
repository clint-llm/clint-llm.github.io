During the consent and before hyperbaric treatment has begun, patients should be provided information regarding the risk of temporary myopic changes in vision and permanent cataract formation. While there are no set guidelines, a baseline ophthalmologic exam could be considered to detect preexisting lenticular pathology and monitor the progression of visual disturbances. The examination may be more beneficial to patients at greater risk of cataract formation, such as diabetics, those greater than 50 years old, smokers, patients on steroid therapy, or those with previous radiation exposures.

A baseline examination of visual acuity and progressive monitoring can detect myopic changes. Patients should be made aware that these changes usually are reversible within days to months after cessation of therapy. Depending on the severity of myopia, most patients will not need prescription lenses. Cataract formation, however, is usually permanent and will likely require lens replacement surgery. With the high success rate of cataract surgery, this side effect is considered very manageable. Due to the relatively benign nature and manageability of these side effects, patients who are determined to have a clinical need for hyperbaric oxygen therapy medicine should not discontinue treatment if myopia or cataracts develop.
