Prior to catheter placement, you are counseled and explained about the procedure, its need, benefits, and potential risks. At this time, it is important that you or your caregiver provide information that may affect the line placement, such as allergies (to dyes/antibiotics/lignocaine), previous line placements, previous line infections, or other details you deem relevant. As per your condition, before line insertion, necessary investigations may be ordered or blood samples drawn to check for bleeding disorders. You are asked not to eat or drink for 6 hours prior to the procedure.

If you are required to be sent home with the central venous catheter in place at the time of discharge, a nurse or health care provider will teach you how to take care of the line. It is important to keep the line clean (by practicing hand hygiene/using alcohol-based hand rubs before handling the line), dry (by taking only sponge baths if needed), and avoiding damage to the catheter by tugging or using sharp objects. Remember to seek medical care if you notice any signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus formation at the site of insertion or developing fever/chills), difficulty breathing, and if the catheter is damaged or falls out.
