Patients with intraocular retinoblastoma, particularly those who have access to modern health care facilities, have an excellent prognosis and an overall survival rate of more than 95% in developed countries. The most critical risk factor associated with poor prognosis is extraocular extension either through the sclera or through the invasion of the optic nerve. Patients who survive bilateral retinoblastoma are at an increased risk of developing non-ocular malignancies later in life the latent period for the development of the second tumor is usually 9 months. External beam radiotherapy decreases the latent period and increases the risk of the second malignancy in the first 30 years of life. The most prevalent type of second malignancy is a sarcoma. The survival of patients who have developed sarcoma is less than 50%.
