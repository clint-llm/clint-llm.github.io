The ERAS system, due to its relatively new venture into the healthcare system, requires systemic auditing to improve outcomes continually. Auditing will identify pitfalls in communication, issues with collaboration between teams, and improving compliance and adherence to ERAS protocols. However, due to the multidisciplinary approach of this pathway and the many medical personnel involved, it can serve as an impediment to implementation. The team members of the ERAS system include physicians, pre-admission testing staff, nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and social workers. This entire cohort needs to be familiar with ERAS principles and must be willing to implement them. This requires changing their mindset from the traditional view of postoperative care to one that is evidence-based and collaborative.
