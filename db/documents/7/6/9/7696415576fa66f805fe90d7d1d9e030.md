During embryological development, the fetal spinal cord is the same length as the vertebral column. However, as the fetus grows, the vertebral canal elongates at a greater relative rate than the spinal cord. In adulthood, the spinal cord is shorter than the vertebral column and terminates at the conus medullaris, at the level of L1 or L2.
