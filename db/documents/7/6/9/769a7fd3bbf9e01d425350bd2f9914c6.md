PDPH can lead to longer hospitilizations and higher healthcare costs. Many measures have been suggested to help prevent the disorder but, thus far, none have been shown to be effective in randomized, controlled trials. The use of ultrasound does show promise as it can accurately predict the depth of the epidural space but until randomized studies are done, the utility of ultrasound remains academic.

Many pharmaceutical agents have been investigated for prevention of PDPH but, so far, most have not lowered the risk of the condition. There even remains controversy about prophylactic bed rest and hydration prior to the procedure.

**Outcomes**

To date, once PDPH is diagnosed, the management should incorporate an interprofessional team of experts including a neurologist, a pharmacist, intensivist, and an anesthesiologist. Anyone with a headache that is not improving or has neurological signs should have a referral to a neurologist.  Monitoring with bed rest and offering hydration are key treatments. Besides a blood patch, many headache drugs have been used to manage PDPH. The pharmacist should be aware of the current literature on these agents since not all are effective in resolving PDPH.

Most of the published literature on PDPH includes case reports and short-term reports with conflicting data. More randomized studies are necessary to determine the ideal method for preventing PDPH and how to treat it once the condition has developed. (Level V)

Treatment with an epidural blood patch remains the gold standard at this time.
