Infection control refers to the policy and procedures implemented to control and minimize the dissemination of infections in hospitals and other healthcare settings with the main purpose of reducing infection rates. Infection control as a formal entity was established in the early 1950s in the United States. By the late 1950s and 1960s, a small number of hospitals began to recognize healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and implemented some of the infection control concepts. This activity reviews the types of infection control methods and their indications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in following principles of infection control to improve outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the single most effective and least expensive way for providers to prevent the spread of infection.
- Summarize standard precautions, contact precautions, droplet precautions, and airborne precautions. 
- Review the types of precautions required for a patient with tuberculosis versus a patient with Clostridium difficile.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for ensuring proper infection control measures are being followed to prevent the spread of infection in healthcare institutions.
