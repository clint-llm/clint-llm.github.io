The blood supply to the foot comes mainly from the dorsalis pedis and the posterior tibial arteries.

The dorsal pedis artery is a continuation of the anterior tibial artery and forms the deep plantar arch by its anastomoses with the lateral plantar artery. The tarsal bones and the dorsal aspect of the metatarsals receive their blood supply from the dorsal pedis artery whereas the deep plantar arch contributes to the blood supply of the toes.

The posterior tibial artery passes through the tarsal tunnel and enters the sole of the foot and then divides into the medial and lateral plantar arteries. These branches provide blood supply to the plantar surface of the foot and via its formation of the deep plantar arch, contribute to the blood supply of the toes.

The blood supply to the joints of the foot is a result of these arteries sharing anastomosis around the joints. The articular capsule is avascular and receives nutrients from the surrounding blood supply via diffusion.

The popliteal lymph nods receive lymphatic drainage from the foot, that subsequently enters the deep and superficial inguinal lymph nodes.
