The QS has four anatomic borders; the teres minor superiorly, the inferior border is the teres major muscle, the medial boundary is the long head of the triceps brachii muscle, and the humeral surgical neck forms the lateral bound. TheÂ QS functions as a passageway for the axillary nerve, and the posterior humeral circumflex artery (PHCA).
