The tongue is a muscular organ that plays a central role in a personâ€™s ability to communicate and to experience food via taste, chewing and swallowing. Injuries to the tongue, therefore, have a considerable impact on quality of life. Tongue lacerations can result from a variety of means including seizures, self-harm, blunt force facial trauma, oral trauma while intubated, and child abuse. This activity describes the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of tongue lacerations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the lacerations.
