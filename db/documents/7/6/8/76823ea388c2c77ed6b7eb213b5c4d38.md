Knowing the ability to achieve complete neurologic recovery declines with each untreated minute of an acute stroke is essential. This is the basis for the "time is brain" concept in which due emphasis is placed on the timely evaluation and management of an acute stroke.

**Ischemic stroke**

The following are highlights from the 2019 AHA/ASA Management Guidelines for AIS.

Airway, Breathing, and Oxygenation: Supplemental oxygen should be provided to maintain oxygen saturation >94%, but it is not recommended in nonhypoxic patients.

Blood pressure (BP): Patients with elevated BP should have their BP carefully lowered to a systolic BP (SBP) <185 mmHg and diastolic BP <110 mmHg before IV fibrinolytic therapy is initiated, and their BP should be maintained at <180/105 mmHg for a minimum of 24 hours after treatment. When mechanical thrombectomy is planned, and the patient has not received IV fibrinolytic therapy, it is reasonable to maintain BP ≤185/110 mmHg before the procedure and at ≤180/105 mmHg during and for 24 hours after the procedure.

Temperature: Hyperthermia (>38°C or 100.4°F) in patients with AIS should be treated with antipyretic medication.

Blood glucose: Hypoglycemia (blood glucose <60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS. Also, hyperglycemia should be treated to achieve blood glucose levels in the range of 140 to 180 mg/dL.

IV alteplase: Table 8 outlines the criteria to determine patient eligibility. IV alteplase at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg with the initial 10% given as a bolus over 1 minute (maximum dose 90 mg over 60 min) is recommended for patients who meet eligibility criteria within 3 hours or within 3 and 4.5 hours of AIS witnessed symptom onset or when the patient was last known well or at baseline. The same dose can be given within 4.5 hours in patients with AIS who awake with stroke symptoms or have an unclear time of onset >4.5 hours from when they were last known well or at baseline and have a DW-MRI lesion smaller than one-third of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory and no visible signal change on FLAIR. Due to bleeding risk, abciximab should not be administered concurrently with IV alteplase, IV aspirin should not be administered within 90 minutes after starting IV alteplase, and IV alteplase should not be administered after a full treatment dose of low-molecular-weight heparin within the previous 24 hours.

Other IV fibrinolytics: A single IV bolus of tenecteplase at 0.25-mg/kg (maximum 25 mg) can be given instead of IV alteplase in patients without contraindications who are also eligible to undergo mechanical thrombectomy. Otherwise, IV defibrinogenating or IV fibrinolytic agents other than alteplase and tenecteplase are not recommended.

Mechanical thrombectomy: Patients eligible for IV alteplase should receive IV alteplase even if mechanical thrombectomy is being considered. If a patient meets all 6 of the following criteria, they should receive mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever or direct aspiration: (1) pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1; (2) AIS caused by an internal carotid artery or MCA segment 1 (M1) occlusion; (3) age ≥18 years; (4) NIHSS score of ≥6; (5) Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of ≥6; and (6) treatment can be started within 6 hours of symptom onset.

Mechanical thrombectomy is also recommended within 6 to 16 hours of witnessed symptom onset or within 16 to 24 hours of the patient's last known well or at baseline. These patients must demonstrate LVO in the anterior circulation and meet additional DAWN or DEFUSE 3 eligibility criteria.

Antiplatelet treatment: Aspirin administration is recommended within 24 to 48 hours after symptom onset; however, it is usually delayed until 24 hours afterward when treated with IV alteplase. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel started within 24 hours after symptom onset is appropriate for patients diagnosed with minor, noncardioembolic ischemic stroke who did not receive IV alteplase.

**Intracerebral hemorrhage**

Initiating treatment for elevated BP within 2 hours of ICH onset and reaching the target BP within 1 hour may reduce HE risk and improve outcomes.

In patients with mild to moderate ICH presenting with an SBP of 150-220 mmHg, the target is 140 mmHg, with the goal of maintaining the SBP between 130 to 150 mmHg.

Anticoagulation should be discontinued immediately in patients with anticoagulant-associated ICH, and rapid reversal should be performed as soon as possible.

Platelet transfusion may be considered in patients being treated with aspirin who require emergency neurosurgery.

Surgical management, compared to medical management alone, has been shown to decrease mortality for selected patients. Surgical options include minimally invasive hematoma evacuation with endoscopic or stereotactic aspiration, external ventricular drain insertion, and craniotomy.

**Subarachnoid hemorrhage**

According to the most recent European Stroke Organization (ESO) and AHA/ASA guidelines, aneurysms should be treated as early as possible to reduce rebleeding risk. The ESO recommends aiming to intervene within 72 hours after symptom onset.

Short-term antifibrinolytic therapy was considered a strategy to reduce the rebleeding risk; however, the routine use of tranexamic acid after SAH cannot be recommended.

Between SAH symptom onset and aneurysm obliteration, the AHA/ASA recommends keeping systolic blood pressure <160 mmHg. The ESO recommends keeping it <180 mmHg but only until the ruptured aneurysm has been coiled or clipped.

A patient with a SAH-associated seizure should be treated with antiepileptic drugs.
