An epidural abscess is an infection within the epidural space anywhere in the brain or spinal cord. Epidural abscesses occur as a result of infections involving the spinal or cranial epidural space. Intracranial epidural abscesses (IEA) are complications of cranial surgery or trauma; they may also develop as complications of otorhinolaryngological infections or other neck and thoracic procedures. This activity examines when an epidural abscess should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify different types of epidural abscesses. 
- Describe the clinical symptoms and signs of epidural abscess. 
- Explain how to manage an epidural abscess.
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with epidural abscesses.
