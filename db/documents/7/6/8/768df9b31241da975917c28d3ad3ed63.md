The initial task in presyncope is to obtain vital signs. An EKG and finger stick glucose test should be performed on all patients, but there is no gold standard for diagnostic testing in presyncope

Common predictors that may indicate a need for further workup include a cardiac or valvular disease history (ventricular dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure), a newly abnormal ECG, anemia or severe volume depletion (from a gastrointestinal bleed), syncope while supine or with effort, report of palpitations or chest pain, persistent abnormal vital signs, or family history of sudden death.
