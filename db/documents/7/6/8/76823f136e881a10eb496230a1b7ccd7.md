The patient should be in a seated position with his/her arm hanging to the side. To identify the AC joint, palpate the clavicle distally until its endpoint. Palpate the small depression just lateral to termination of the clavicle; this is the joint space. After identifying the AC joint, prepare the site with a cleaning solution such as chlorhexidine, and following preparation, insert the needle from the superior anterior approach and aim the needle inferiorly. If meeting resistance, redirect the needle slightly until it enters the joint space.Â Once in the joint, inject the solution slowly. Ultrasound, if available, can significantly improve the accuracy of AC joint injections

Upon completion of the injection, reevaluate patient and have them passively range the shoulder to determine whether there is clinical improvement. Inform the patient that pain can get worse over the next 48 hours if a steroid flare occurs. If the pain does worsen, instruct the patient to treat with ice and NSAIDs.
