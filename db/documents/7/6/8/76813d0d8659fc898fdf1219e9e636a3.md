Clinical graft patency of autogenous saphenous vein grafts in the arterial circulation can be divided into three temporal categories: early, defined as 0 to 30 days; short-term, defined as 30 days to 24 months; and long-term, defined as greater than 24 months. Early failures are ascribed most commonly to technical issues occurring at the graft anastomoses, such as the graft's position, kinking, or poor distal runoff. These early graft failures account for as many as 10% of total vein graft failures.
