The term pheochromocytoma first described by Mr. Pick in 1912. Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that arises from chromaffin cells present in the adrenal medulla or paraganglion cells. It named in this way as these tissuesÂ have a special reaction on the application of a chromium salt. Dr. Charles Mayo presented the first case of pheochromocytoma in 1937 with a clinical diagnosis and therapeutic surgical resection.
