Neurofibromas are the most prevalent benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Often appearing as a soft, skin-colored papule or small subcutaneous nodule, they arise from endoneurium and the connective tissues of peripheral nerve sheaths. Neurofibromas are comprised of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, perineural cells, and mast cells in a variably myxoid background.
