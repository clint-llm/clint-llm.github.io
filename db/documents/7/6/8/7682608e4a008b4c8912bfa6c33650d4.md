While the location of the appendicular orifice at the base of the cecum is a consistent anatomical feature, the position of its tip is not. Variations in the position include retrocecal(but intraperitoneal), subcecal, pre-ileal and post-ileal, pelvic and as far as into the hepatorenal recess. In addition, factors such as posture, respiration, and distention of adjacent bowels can influence the position of the appendix. The retrocecal position is by far the most common. This can cause clinical confusion in diagnosing appendicitis as variations in position can produce different symptoms. Rarely agenesis of the appendix as well as duplication or triplication has been described in the literature. With advancing pregnancy, the enlarging uterus pushes the appendix cephalad, so much so that, by the end of the third trimester the pain of appendicitis may be perceived in the right upper quadrant.
