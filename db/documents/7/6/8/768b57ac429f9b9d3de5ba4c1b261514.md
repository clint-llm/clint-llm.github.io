Sinus arrhythmia is a variation of normal sinus rhythm that characteristically presents with an irregular rate in which the change in the R-R interval is greater than 0.12 seconds. Additionally, the P waves are typically monoform and in a pattern consistent with atrial activation originating from the sinus node. During respiration, intermittent vagus nerve activation occurs, which results in beat-to-beat variations in the resting heart rate. When present, sinus arrhythmia typically indicates good cardiovascular health. This activity illustrates the diagnosis of sinus arrhythmia on telemetry and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the features of sinus arrhythmia.
- Articulate the pathophysiology of sinus arrhythmia.
- Outline the health expected in a patient with sinus arrhythmia.
- Explain the importance of cooperation among the interprofessional team members in the identification of this rhythm and counseling patients that this sinus arrhythmia is normal and serves as an indicator of cardiac health.
