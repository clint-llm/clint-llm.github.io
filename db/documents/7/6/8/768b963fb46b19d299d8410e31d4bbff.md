As noted, the majority of cases of acute bacterial pharyngitis are either noninfectious or nonbacterial. When considering the possibility of bacterial pharyngitis, providers should also consider:

- Allergic reaction to environmental factors like pollen, indoor or outdoor pollutants or medications

- Irritant pharyngitis due to gastroesophageal reflux or smoking

- Traumatic pharyngitis due to excessive shouting, snoring, or recent tracheal intubation

- Aphthous ulcers

- Viral pharyngitis due to common viral upper respiratory pathogens like adeno-,Â rhino-, or coronavirus

- Viral pharyngitis due to more serious pathogens like infectious mononucleosis, pandemic coronavirus or HIV

- Fungal infections such as esophageal candidiasis

- Bacterial complications such as lymphangitis or peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess
