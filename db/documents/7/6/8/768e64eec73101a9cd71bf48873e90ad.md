Penile prosthesis implantation is a procedure that can have a profound impact on a patient's quality of life. However, serious complications such as implant infection, erosion, or injury to surrounding anatomic structures can occur. Therefore it is important to identify risk factors preoperatively. Additionally, a thorough multidisciplinary approach is needed to limit complications and improve outcomes. Before proceeding with surgery, the patient should have the primary evaluation by a urologist. Further, a medical and cardiac evaluation may be necessary in select cases. The anesthesiologist will need to evaluate the patient on the day of surgery, as many patients will have COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, or other conditions that require careful anesthesia planning. Further, pharmacist contribution is essential for proper parenteral antibiotic dosing. Targeted, weight-based dosing for parenteral antibiotics are recommended to help prevent penile prosthesis infection (Level 2 evidence).

Postoperative nursing care is also important, specifically concerning catheter and drain management while in the hospital setting. Overall, a team approach helps ensure all risk factors are minimized. By providing a multidisciplinary approach, patients can be given the opportunity for the safest outcomes with the highest satisfaction.
