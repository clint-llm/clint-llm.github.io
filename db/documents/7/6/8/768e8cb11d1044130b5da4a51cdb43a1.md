Obtain and organize all equipment before splint application. The necessary equipment for a plaster or fiberglass splint includes:

- Sheet or towel to protect patient clothing

- Stockinette (a soft, loosely knitted stretch fabric) or fabric underpadding

- Undercast padding, which is typically made out of cotton.

- Plaster (8-10 sheets thick) or padded fiberglass. In general, forearm splints require smaller width, and upper arm and leg splints require larger width rolls of material.

- Water bucket filled with cool water.

- Elastic bandage

- Sling for upper extremityÂ injuries

- If fracture reduction is attempted, a C-arm X-ray should be used for the evaluation of the fracture reduction.
