The recommended intravenous dose of F18 FDG for adults is 370-740 MBq and for children is 4Â to 5 MBq/kg.

Imaging is generally performed without oral or IV contrast. The patients are routinely advised to drink water which can act as a negative contrast agent for GIT.

Once the patient is on the scanner bed, the image acquisition starts with a topogram to plan the scanning area. For GI cancers, the imaging is mostly performed from the base of the skull to the mid-thigh. The next step is the non-breath-hold CT scan. The patient bed then moves to the PET component of the scanner to complete the combined imaging. The first set of data comprises non-attenuation correction imaging, which then undergoes attenuation correction using CT scan images.

The interpretation of PET/CT images is largely carried out through maximum standard uptake value (SUV max) measurements. This is a semiquantitative assessment that is partly affected by the general metabolic status of the individual. Therefore, the background mediastinal blood pool and hepatic SUV max are recorded as a reference.

There is no single SUV value that can reliably differentiate benign from malignant process.

- Low uptake= SUV max < 2.5

- Intermediate uptake= SUV max 2.5 to 5

- High uptake = SUV max > 5

- Intense uptake = SUV max > 10
