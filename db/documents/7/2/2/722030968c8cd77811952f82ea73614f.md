The pathophysiology of TxA2 includes increased production in the setting of injury and inflammation. Increased production leads to increased activation of the TP, which increases platelets activation, aggregation, and vasoconstriction. These all result in thrombosis and thus, decreased blood flow to various parts of the body. Furthermore, pathological states can disturb the physiologic redox state of cells, leading to increased ROS. Exposure of these ROS to membrane lipids can induce nonenzymatic peroxidation reactions leading to the production of isoprostanes, which also activate the TP and increase rates of thrombosis.
