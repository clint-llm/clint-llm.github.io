Histologic diagnosis of AS is challenging. Morphologic differences are very subtle and it is hard to distinguish between a benign proliferation of vessels versus AS. AS is infiltration and is devoid of a capsule, hence it is hard to distinguish normal from abnormal tissue. Abnormal, pleomorphic, malignant endothelial cells are the hallmark of AS. These cells can be rounded, polygonal, or fusiform and can have an epithelioid appearance.

In the well-differentiated areas, abnormal endothelial cells form functioning vascular sinusoid continuous with normal vascular channels. As the aggressiveness of the tumor increases, the architecture gets more distorted and the abnormal cells stack in multiple layers and form papillary like projections into the vascular lumen. In poorly differentiated areas, the malignant epithelial cells form an epithelioid morphology with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, which make it difficult to distinguish from anaplastic carcinoma or melanoma.

Immunohistochemistry plays a critical role in identifying AS. As typically express endothelial markers including von Willebrand factor, CD34, CD31, Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1, and VEGF. Von Willebrand factor, U europaeus agglutinin 1, and CD31 are the most useful markers in poorly differentiated cases. It is imperative to check for melanocytic markers (S-100, human melanoma black-45, and melanoma antigen) to rule out melanoma.
