The entire interprofessional healthcare team, e.g., clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), specialists (e.g., rheumatologists), nurses, pharmacists, etc., need to work together to ensure the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab therapy. The patient needs training on how to correctly self-administer and store ixekizumab; the clinician, nurse, or pharmacist can perform this education. In fact, it may serve the patient well to hear it from multiple providers to optimize therapy. Notably, theÂ interprofessional team needs to monitor for signs of severe infection and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. The pharmacist should verify the dosing and perform a drug interaction check. Nursing can monitor adverse events, make preliminary assessments of treatment effectiveness on subsequent visits, and verify patient adherence to pharmacotherapy.

Both nurses and pharmacists need to have an open communication line with the prescribing clinician to report or discuss any concerns regarding ixekizumab therapy or the patient drug regimen. This type of open interprofessional healthcare team communication is necessary to optimize patient outcomes with minimal adverse events. [Level 5]
