Amniotic band syndrome/amniotic band sequence (ABS) is a highly variable spectrum of anomalies affecting various anatomical structures during fetal life.

Etiology is multifactorial with multiple proposed mechanisms; the most widely accepted theories include amniotic band attachment, vascular disruption, and rare genetic mutation.

There are four main categories of anatomical defects â€“ constriction rings, limb defects, spine/neural defects, and craniofacial defects.

It is diagnosable prenatally. The extent of ABS and severity of defect dictates the care of pregnant mothers as there are no clear published guidelines. In-utero lysis of amniotic band can salvage limb function, but again there are no guidelines for selecting patients. Postnatal treatment involves the release of constricting rings, if possible, to save the distal limb. ABS can also lead to lethal deformation of vital internal organs in rare cases.
