Interprofessional healthcare team members should check the patient's blood pressure before starting the medication and, additionally, continue to monitor blood pressure while on venlafaxine. Patients on venlafaxine should also have their renal function, and lipid profiles monitored. Close monitoring of psychiatric disorders, including symptoms of suicidality, depression, mania, anxiety, or unusual behavior changes, is a necessary precaution. Exercise care when transitioning from or to monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Do not start venlafaxine within two weeks of stopping an MAOI, and MAOI therapy should not commence within seven days of stopping venlafaxine. Only through close monitoring of the patient can the adverse effects be avoided. This monitoring should have contributions from all clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nursing staff, and pharmacists, who need to coordinate their activities and openly share patient information to drive therapeutic decisions, minimize adverse events, drug-drug interactions, and optimizing patient outcomes.
