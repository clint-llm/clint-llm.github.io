In general, the indications for central venous access include the following:

- Peripheral access is unobtainable

- Medication to be infused is known to induce peripheral phlebitis

- High-volume fluid and parenteral nutrition administration is required

- Emergency resuscitation is warranted

- Monitoring of central venous oxygen saturation and central venous pressure is indicated

- Frequent blood sampling needs to be performed

- Access is necessary to perform hemodialysis, hemofiltration, or apheresis.

Note that the indications mentioned above are not absolute. The balance of risks and benefits when performing the procedure should be considered for each patient. The indication for line placement also prompts the proceduralist to consider additional factors.

- Is short-term or long-term access (e.g., peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)) or implantable venous access (Port-a-cath or Broviac catheter) more beneficial to the patient?

- Does the catheter tip need to be in a “low-lying” or “high-lying” position? For instance, a low-lying position is adequate during an emergency resuscitation situation. However, should monitoring central venous oxygen saturation and central venous pressure be required, a high-lying position would provide more accurate data.
