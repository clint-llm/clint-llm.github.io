Thioridazine is an oral medication taken in tablet form. The tablets come in either 10 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg. For refractory schizophrenia, dosing recommendations are to initiate thioridazine at 50 mg to 100 mg three times per day and gradually increase the dose as indicated to a maximum of 800 mg per day.

Prescribers must be aware of the risk of inducing dose-dependent QTc prolongation, hence the suggestion to start with a lower dose and increase slowly. Thioridazine also comes in liquid form at 30 mg/mL and 100 mg/mL.
