It is important to differentiate a macroaneurysm from a microaneurysm. Microaneurysms typically arise from capillaries and are small, red spots with sizes ranging from 15 to 100 μm in diameter.

The formation of a microaneurysm is usually associated with diabetic retinopathy. However, other systemic conditions include ischemic, infectious, inflammatory, hematologic, and radiation-related disorders.

Retinal artery macroaneurysms arise from the muscular arterioles. Size of a macroaneurysm ranges between 100 to 250 μm in diameter.

Histopathological examination reveals the presence of both thrombus and cholesterol within the macroaneurysm.
