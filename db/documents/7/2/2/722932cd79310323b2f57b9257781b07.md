The interscalene triangle is a paired structure situated at the root of the neck, with its apex pointed superiorly towards the base of the skull. The horizontal base of the triangle is formed by the superior border of the first rib. The two vertical sides of the triangle are formed by the scalenus anterior and scalenus medius muscles. The anterior covering of the scalene triangle (i.e., the ‘roof’ of the triangle) is the prevertebral fascia of the neck, which extends from the body of the T4 vertebra up to the base of the skull.

The first rib is the broadest and flattest of all the ribs and is also the most curved. Its head articulates with the body of the T1 vertebra, and the medial part articulates with the manubrium sternum. Features along its upper surface include a groove for the subclavian artery, and the scalene tubercle, to which the scalenus anterior is attached. The anterior scalene arises from the transverse processes of the anterior tubercles of C3 to C6, terminating as a narrow tendon at the first rib attached to the scalene tubercle on the upper surface of it. The middle scalene arises from the lateral parts of C1 and C2 (atlas and axis), as well as the transverse processes of the posterior tubercles of C3 to C7, and also inserts into the first rib, at the quadrangular area between its neck and the subclavian groove.
