Werner syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder and it is unlikely that most clinicians will ever see such a case. However, because the disorder involves rapid aging of the entire body, these individuals need to be seen by an interprofessional team that includes a social worker, therapist, cardiologist, dermatologist, endocrinologist, orthopedic surgeon, ophthalmologist, oncologist, and rheumatologist. The key is to improve the quality of life and provide supportive care. There is no cure for WernerÂ syndrome and most people affected by the disorder are dead by the fifth decade of life. Thus, it is important not to offer radical surgeries and procedures because this usually leads to more harm than good.
