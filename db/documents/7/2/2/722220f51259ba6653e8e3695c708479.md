Cutaneous endometriosis can be divided into primary cutaneous endometriosis and secondary cutaneous endometriosis. The etiology of primary cutaneous endometriosis is unclear and is known to occur spontaneously. The cause of secondary cutaneous endometriosis is assumed to occur due to seeding after procedures relating to abdominal or pelvic surgery resulting in the implantation of endometrial tissue into the skin.
