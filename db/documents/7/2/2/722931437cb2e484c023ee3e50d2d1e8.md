Depending on the condition, vision can be stable or progressive in nature. Conditions such as age-related macular degeneration only causes central vision loss, thus these patients will not experience total blindness. Whereas, retinitis pigmentosa can cause peripheral vision loss leading to central vision loss and total blindness. Conditions causing blindness may be prevented with early detection, proper diagnosis and treatment. It is recommended to have a comprehensive eye examination every 1-2 years for all ages. For infants, InfantSEE is a free public health program available to provide comprehensive infant vision and eye health assessment within the first year of the infant's life.
