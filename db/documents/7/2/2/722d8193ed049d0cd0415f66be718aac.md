Also, proper workup to rule out all secondary causes of facial pain like a vascular loop near the trigeminal nerve is essential. All members of the healthcare team should be familiar with this condition as it is not very common, but they do occur in the real world and must be well managed.

An interprofessional approach is necessary for the management of SUNCT, which includes the primary clinician, neurologist, nursing staff, and the pharmacy. A prompt referral is necessary from the primary clinician to a neurologist for early diagnosis and management of this condition because of its debilitating nature. This article summarizes vital features in recognizing this condition, whether it is in the emergency department, primary office visit, or on the neurology wards. Although it is not a very common condition, it could present as a very serious possibility if not adequately investigated; therefore, this educational activity could help many professions to understand and co-manage SUNCT/SUNA.
