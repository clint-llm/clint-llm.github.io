In pigmented purpuric dermatoses, capillaritis in the dermis with possible concomitant venous hypertension leads to endothelial cell dysfunction and extravasation of red blood cells. These erythrocytes deposit in the dermis, clinically manifesting as purpuric macules and patches with variable configurations. Over time, as the hemosiderin is resorbed, golden-brown pigmentation collects in the skin, which over time resolves. However, the disease can often flare and persistÂ chronically.
