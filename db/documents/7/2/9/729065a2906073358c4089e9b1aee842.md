The epidermal layer of the skin does not have blood or lymphatic vessels. The dermis has a superficial and deep horizontal vascular plexus. Capillaries arise from the superficial plexus and terminate close to the epidermal layer. Lymphatics also make two plexuses near the blood vessels; the superficial lymphatic plexus moves through the dermal papillae and descends into the lower dermis. The lymphatic vessels do not come as close to the epidermis as the blood vessels. These vessels provide nutrients, discard waste, and produce inflammation for the nerves found in the skin.
