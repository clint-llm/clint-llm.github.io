Children presenting with HFM should have a detailed, three-generation family history conducted to identify any malformations that are characteristic for HFM.

The physical exam should focus on identifying facial abnormalities and asymmetries involving the auricle, ossicles, zygoma, maxilla, mandible, jaw mobility, and occlusion. Cleft lip and palate are common in HFM patients and should be evaluated. Ophthalmologic findings such as ocular dermoid cysts and vertebral abnormalities such as scoliosis may indicate the more severe variant of Goldenhar syndrome.
