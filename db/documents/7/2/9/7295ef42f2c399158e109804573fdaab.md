Rehabilitation treatment becomes the cornerstone of managing an addicted patient from sobering up to maintaining their remission. Since the 1960s, various modalities have found public and private aid such as methadone clinics, free outpatient treatment programs, and residential community treatment sites.

Among the most common and effective programs include the 12-step programs; this is category includes AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), Narcotics Anonymous, and Cocaine Anonymous. These are a form of peer support groups that are commonplace in addiction management with the dual benefit of aiding drug addiction reform and co-occurring mental health problems. Some of the positive outcomes of these programs include increased self-confidence, self-efficacy, and healthy coping strategies for addicts to maintain their abstinence. Overall, rehabilitation care for addiction management includes fail-safes that prevent relapse from happening through pharmacological deterrents and peer-support groups.
