There are no signs and symptoms of LAE in itself, and it is a pathophysiological response to other underlying cardiovascular conditions. Therefore, the focus should be on recognizing signs and symptoms related to the underlying pathological causes of LAE. Patients with LAE might present with a variety of symptoms, including palpitations, dyspnea, syncope, peripheral edema, fatigue, and weight gain.

Similarly, some patients in early phases of underlying cardiac disease such as left ventricular hypertrophy and a mild form of mitral valve diseases, stenosis or regurgitation, and undiagnosed systemic hypertension may present with absolutely no symptom, and the initial presentation could be an abnormal electrocardiogram or echocardiogram examined for any other reason. It is necessary for proper evaluation of the history of present illness in these patients, including the past medical history, social and family history that includes the risk factors for left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular abnormalities, congenital heart diseases, arrhythmias, and hypertension.
