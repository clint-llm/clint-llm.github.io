Annular pancreas is a rare congenital abnormality that causes the encasement of the duodenum by a band of pancreatic tissue. Previously, this anomaly was noted on autopsies and abdominal surgeries, but with the emergence of newer diagnostic modalities, it has been recognized more regularly. Most individuals with this abnormality are asymptomatic but can present with features of intestinal obstruction in infancy or abdominal pain, peptic ulcer disease, and pancreatitis during adulthood. This condition is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities, with the most common being trisomy 21. The management for symptomatic patients from AP is purely surgical with duodenal bypass procedures such as gastrojejunostomy, duodenoduodenostomy, or duodenojejunostomy in both adults and children.
