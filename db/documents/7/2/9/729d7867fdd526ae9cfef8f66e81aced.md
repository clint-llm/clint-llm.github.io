Activated charcoal is widely used in emergency departments to treat many types of toxic ingestions. Its use significantly prevents the absorption of many toxic drugs and other poisons if given early post-ingestion. However, patient-oriented outcome data for the benefit of activated charcoal is limited, and its administration is not without risk. Healthcare professionals in the emergency department, including nurses, pharmacists, and physicians, need to know when and how to use activated charcoal for the best results. While activated charcoal is widely sold in health food stores to treat various conditions, it is important to educate the patient about the harm of the unregulated use of this substance.

A clinician contemplating the use of activated charcoal should consider consulting with a clinical pharmacist, toxicologist, or Poison Control if there are any doubts regarding the appropriateness of its use. These resources can also assist with appropriate dosing and administration. Nurses will administer the activated charcoal and should help monitor the patient for adverse events as well as assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Communication between team members is essential, as is documenting any interventions and patient responses to treatment. Functioning as a collaborative interprofessional team will optimize patient outcomes when using activated charcoal for toxic substance ingestions. [Level 5]
