The primary prevention of carbon monoxide toxicity relies on awareness and education through public health resources, broadcasts, and media, especially in anticipation of national disasters and emergencies such as hurricanes, floods, power outages, and winter storms, as people will be utilizing alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating, cooling, or cooking. Additionally, generators, camp stoves, space heaters, and other devices should be accompanied by specific instructions stating they are not to be used in enclosed spaces. Nationally, the United States government has established air-quality standards to keep the level of carboxyhemoglobin and other pollutants low and also reports an air-quality index to alert the public. Insurance companies may offer incentives for those who implement carbon monoxide alarms in their home.
