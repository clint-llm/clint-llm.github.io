Usually, the disease is unilateral. Primary pseudoarthrosis or neonatal form of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia is seen at birth or within the first few weeks of life. It presents as limb deformity characterized by the anterolateral bowing of the tibia or as discontinuity between the two bones within the tibial segment.Â Secondary pseudoarthrosis is characterized by pathological fractures which occur when the child starts walking. The disease can manifest as simple bowing of the tibia, extensive bone deformities with bowing in one or both the bones of the leg, to pathological fractures and pseudoarthrosis. Leg shortening is also seen due to tibial bowing and decreased tibial growth.

A complete dermatological and neurological examination is also done in cases associated with NF-1, which is an autosomal dominant, multisystemic neurocutaneous disease.
