It is difficult to determine the number of children that experience school refusal. A common statistic cited by organizations that advocate for increased mental health awareness suggests school refusal affects 2% to 5% of all school-age children. If the child has been home for a while, for example during summer vacation, another holiday break, or a brief illness, it may trigger the problem. A stressful event like the death of a pet or relative or moving to a new house may also precipitate the condition. When a child does not want to go to school often says they are sick. When they wake up in the morning, they complain of having a headache, stomachache, or a sore throat. If someone allows them to stay home, the “illness” might go away, but it comes back the next morning before school. Some children may have crying spells or temper tantrums.
