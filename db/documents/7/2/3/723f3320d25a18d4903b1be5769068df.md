- Epidural needles: Multiple types have been designed (Tuohy, Hustead, Crawford, Weiss, etc.), Tuohy being the most used one. These are usually 17 or 18 G and 3.5 inches long (up to 6 inches for obese patients).

- Loss of resistance syringe: Either made of glass or plastic. It has very low friction between the plunger and the barrel toÂ permit detection of the change in resistance at the epidural space. The syringes may be filled up with air, saline, or both; this apparently does not affect the success of identifying the epidural space, nor does it change the complication rate.

- Epidural catheters: used for continuous epidural anesthesia/analgesia. They may be flexible or stiff. They may also have a single hole or multiple ones.
