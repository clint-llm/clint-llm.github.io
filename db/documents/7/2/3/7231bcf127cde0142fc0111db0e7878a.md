The majority of people with acute scrotal pain initially present to the emergency department, and thus, the triage nurse should be fully aware of causes that are urgent and demand immediate medical attention and those that are elective. In many cases, the urologist will need to be consulted to determine the final diagnosis. The role of the radiologist is vital as some type of imaging study is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. The nurse is also important for educating the patient on scrotal disorders like epididymitis which may be associated with sexual activity. Patients who have been diagnosed with torsion should be told to avoid sporting activities unless cleared by the urologist, as there is a small risk of recurrence.

**Outcomes**

The prognosis of acute scrotal pain depends on the cause. In patients with epididymitis, pain improves within several days of treatment, but the induration may last weeks or months. Some diabetics may develop an abscess and sepsis is a potential consequence. In patients who developed epididymitis secondary to sexual activity, the partner needs to be referred and treated, to stop the cycle of transmission. For patients with a diagnosis of testicular torsion, the diagnosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment. If the treatment is delayed by 12-24 hours, the risk of losing testis and infertility is high.
