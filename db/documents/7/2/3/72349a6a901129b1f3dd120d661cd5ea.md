Although tropicamide is a short-acting drug, and the frequency of associated adverse events is rare, there are certain instances when reversal of mydriasis is necessary, including decreasing the risk of angle-closure glaucoma, improving blurry vision, and decreasing recovery time for patient comfort. Presumably, a cholinergic agent like pilocarpine should be able to undo the effects of an anticholinergic drug. However, several studies have reported conflicting pupillary responses.

A study of 23 healthy subjects demonstrated that pilocarpine had an insignificant impact on returning pupil diameter to baseline. Seventeen percent of subjects reportedly had a reduction in visual acuity, indicating that pilocarpine use is futile and possibly detrimental.

The use of dapiprazole can cut recovery time in half compared to waiting for tropicamide to wear off on its own.
