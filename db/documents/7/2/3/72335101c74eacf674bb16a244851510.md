Untreated glaucoma may lead to severe peripheral vision loss, followed by central visual loss. Patient outcomes can be improved through ophthalmologist collaboration with other healthcare professionals within the community setting. Community optometrists are well-equipped to perform routine eye examinations, monitor patientsâ€™ intraocular pressures, and perform perimetry testing. They are aiming to refer all glaucoma suspects to secondary care. Patients diagnosed with glaucoma need to be closely monitored and provided with ongoing education. The primary care physician can work with patients to treat co-morbidities that may impair the self-administration of eye drops such as arthritis of the hands and optimize vascular risk factors that may be elevated in this patient group.
