Patients can present with several diverse, nonspecific symptoms, and up to 10% may be asymptomatic.Â In others, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, and syncope are common symptoms. Vague symptoms such as cough, fever, dizziness, shoulder or back pain, dysphagia, congestive heart failure, and stroke may also be present.

Physical examination signs are also often nonspecific. Patients may have bradycardia, hypotension, decreased heart sounds, pericardial friction rub, and a murmur. Signs of arrhythmia, heart failure, and tamponade due to the rupture of the false aneurysm can also occur. Trauma patients should be assessed for myocardial contusion as it can go undiagnosed.
