Erythema toxicum neonatorum is a condition that has been described (rash) as early as the 15th century by a pediatrician named B. Metlinger. It has been associated with a reaction to meconium to the skin of the baby, and the name of the condition has changed several times over the years, from erythema populated to erythema dyspepsia and erythema neonatorum allergicum. In 1912, Dr. Karl Leiner, an Austrian pediatrician, named the condition erythema toxicum neonatorum and currently this is the denomination used for these skin findings. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of erythema toxicum neonatorum, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of an infant with erythema toxicum neonatorum on physical examination.
- Summarize the histological changes seen in cases of erythema toxicum neonatorum.
- List some of the possible differential diagnoses that would be considered in an infant presenting with potential erythema toxicum neonatorum.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with management of erythema toxicum neonatorum.
