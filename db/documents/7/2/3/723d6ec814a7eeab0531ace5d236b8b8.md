The evaluation should include:

- Beta hCG to rule out pregnancy because pregnancy is the most common cause of amenorrhea

- Prolactin level to rule out prolactinoma

- Testosterone and DHEAS to rule out hyperandrogenism

- FSH and LH for hypothalamic amenorrhea, BMI (to look for malnutrition, anorexia nervosa, and excessive strenuous exercise)

- Pelvic ultrasound and adrenal CT for androgen-secreting tumors and other anatomical defects like Mayor-Rokitansky-Kauser-Hauser syndrome

- Progesterone challenge test: This test is performed to differentiate between the anovulation, anatomic, and estradiol deficiency as causes of amenorrhea. Progesterone is administrated to the patient in the form of intramuscular injection and after progesterone is withdrawn. If bleeding takes place within 2 to 7 days, the cause must be the anovulation, but if no bleeding takes place after progesterone withdrawal, the causes are other than anovulation or premature ovarian failure. These other causes can include estradiol deficiency or anatomic defects like cervical stenosis and Asherman syndrome.

- Karyotyping is sometimes an important test for Turner and androgen insensitivity syndromes.
