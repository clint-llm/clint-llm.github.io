Like any anti-inflammatory agent, steroid toxicity is treated similarly to any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug overdose or toxicity. Although the frequency of life-threatening complications from steroids and NSAID overdose is low, the overdose response ranges from no symptoms to death despite intensive-care treatment. Most symptoms are an excess of the pharmacological action of steroids and NSAIDs and include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, ear ringing, and nystagmus. A significant dose-response relationship occurs with the long-term use of systemic corticosteroids and the development of systemic corticosteroid-related complications for patients with severe asthma, resulting in an increased burden and costs on the health care system.
