Z-plasty is a common reconstructive surgical technique used for scar revision and contracture release. It involves the transposition of two opposing triangular flaps that then changes the direction of a scar so that it is better aligned with natural skin folds or relaxed skin tension lines and either less visually apparent or less restrictive to movement. The technique has been applied to numerous areas of the body, from fingers to the nose, the chest to the palate, the face, the eye, the ear, and many others besides. A benefit of this procedure over other scar revision techniques is that it does not necessarily require skin excision and is therefore considered a tissue-sparing option. This activity illustrates how Z-plasty is performed and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing chronic scars.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for a Z-plasty.
- Describe the technique of Z plasty.
- Review the contraindications to performing a Z-plasty. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies that enhance care coordination and communication to advance the management of scars and improve patient outcomes in patients receiving a Z-plasty procedure.
