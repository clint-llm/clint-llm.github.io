The aortic arch is made up of several layers of cells. The intimal layer consists of endothelial cells, connective fibers under the endothelial cells, and an internal lamina. In the medium tunica, which is the thickest compared to the other arteries of the body, one can find smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix. Another layer is the adventitia, formed from connective tissue that wraps around the nerves (nervi vascularis) and blood vessels (vasa vasorum). This tract of the artery is essential because it must manage the blood pressure coming from the left ventricle, adapting to the speed of the flow, the direction, and the quantity of the same blood flow (mechanotransduction). The volume of the aortic tissue is isochoric; it is kept constant in its form and histological characteristics in a physiological and healthy environment.
