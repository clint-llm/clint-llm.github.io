Since HHT affects multiple organ systems, adequate treatment of the condition requires multidisciplinary care. A referral to a hematologist is indicated to manage iron deficiency anemia and for anticoagulation if diagnosed with venous thromboembolism. For management of epistaxis, consider referral to an otolaryngologist. A gastroenterologist should be involved if there is a concern for GI bleeds.

HHT patients with pulmonary AVMs should be seen by a pulmonologist, interventional radiologist, or thoracic surgeon. Presence of a cerebral AVM warrants referral to a neurosurgeon. If embolization is not an option, an interventional radiologist or general surgeon should manage hepatic AVMs.
