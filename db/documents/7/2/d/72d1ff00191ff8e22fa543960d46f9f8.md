A patient with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis presents with a sudden onset of nonspecific symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Abdominal pain is typically the dominant symptom, with severe pain in the mid-abdomen. Other abdominal signs, including tenderness, distention, and ascites, may occur. If not treated, the abdominal pain will worsen as peritonitis develops. This indicates intestinal infarction, which is seen in one to two-thirds of mesenteric venous thrombosis patients. Unlike in arterial ischemia, the evolution from normal to an ischemic bowel is gradual in mesenteric venous thrombosis. Subacute mesenteric venous thrombosis patients experience symptoms over days to weeks. The average duration of symptoms varies from 6 to 14 days.

Chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis patients are often asymptomatic with a diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis resulting from incidental findings or portal hypertension. Chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis is differentiated from acute mesenteric venous thrombosis by the existence of collateral venous circulation and cavernoma around the thrombosed vein. Chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis accounts for approximately 20% to 40% of total mesenteric venous thrombosis cases and rarely causes intestinal infarction.
