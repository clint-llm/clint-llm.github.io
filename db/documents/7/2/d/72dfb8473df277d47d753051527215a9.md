The histological features of LCH are variable and influenced by the age of lesions and their location.

The primary lesion is granulomatous with an influx of eosinophils, macrophages, T cells and multinucleated cells. The Birbeck granule is the microscopic hallmark of the disorder but may not be seen in lesions of the spleen, liver, and GI tract.
