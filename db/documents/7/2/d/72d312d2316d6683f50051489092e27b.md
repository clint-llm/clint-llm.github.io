Osteoclasts arise from macrophage precursors, so they share many of the same antigens found on macrophages and giant cells. Therefore, identifying osteoclasts relies on the presence and lack of certain antigens. Antigens associated with osteoclasts are CD13, CD14, and CD68, which have a particularly strong association with osteoclasts. The lack of CD56, GrB, and Ki67 expression help distinguish osteoclasts from macrophages and giant cells.
