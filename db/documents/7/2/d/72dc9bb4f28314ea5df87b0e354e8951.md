Patients receiving cenegermin ophthalmic solution should be monitored for the clinical progression of neuropathic keratitis. Mild to moderate eye discomfort during treatment with cenegermin is expected. Adverse fetal effects on organogenesis were not observed in pregnant rats or rabbits at clinically relevant doses. In addition, during pre-and postnatal development studies, administration to rats throughout gestation and lactation produced no adverse effects in offspring at clinically relevant doses. Therefore, ophthalmic cenegermin is not expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants.

Most patients do not have adverse drug reactions as systemic absorption of topical ophthalmic nhNGF is unlikely. After administration, the drops pass through the nasolacrimal duct to the nasal and then the oropharyngeal cavity and are degraded by proteases. To limit any potential amount of systemic absorption of the drug, after application, apply pressure to the tear duct at the corner of the eye for one minute and wipe any excess solution with a tissue. Treatment can cause temporary blurring and visual disturbance for a few minutes after topical instillation. Patients should wait until their vision clears before driving or operating machines.

Patients should be monitored for ocular cancer during and after treatment as cenegermin is a growth factor and may theoretically affect ocular cancer as per product labeling. However, animal or human studies have not been conducted to determine the carcinogenic potential of cenegermin therapy.
