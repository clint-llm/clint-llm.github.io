HIV is a spherical virus that attaches to host cells with glycoproteins.  The virus then integrates its chromosomal material into that of the host cell, taking over cellular machinery to generate more viral proteins and genetic material. Eventually, the host cell will die, and other CD4 cells will be infected.  The viral enzymes protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase are involved in this process and are the targets of ART.

The number of CD4 cells within the affected individual will fall by approximately 50-80 cells/µL per year without the initiation of ART, and the decline may be even faster once the count falls below 200 cells/uL.

With the addition of ART, cardiovascular disease is now the major cause of morbidity and mortality for HIV patients. It is unclear whether the increase in cardiovascular disease is due to HIV, ART drugs, a metabolic syndrome occurring with HIV infection, or a combination of all of these factors.
