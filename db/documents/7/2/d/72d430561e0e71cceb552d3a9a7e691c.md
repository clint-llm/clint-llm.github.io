The alveoli are the lung's functional units. The alveolar wall is composed mainly of cells called pneumocytes. There are two known types of pneumocytes; type I and type II. Type I pneumocytes, making up 90% to 95% of the alveolar wall, are efficient gas exchangers due to their thin, plate-like structure, with the trade-off being their inability to replicate and susceptibility to toxic injury. Type II pneumocytes comprise most of the remaining cells in the alveoli Type II pneumocytes secrete pulmonary surfactant, which is an important factor in lowering surface tension in the alveoli and thus preventing atelectasis. Moreover, they are mitotically active cells and replace the easily damaged type I pneumocytes.
