During operation preparation, risk factors and contraindications are evaluated. Since cardiac surgery is limited to advanced cardiac diseases benefits of operation as last treatment options often outweigh risks. To assess the operative risk the EuroScore risk stratification tool has been developed. There are many other risk tools such as the Parsonnet score or the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score to identify patients that are eligible for surgery.

Instability of the patient may cause the operation to be postponed. In a patient with myocardial infarction planned for CABG, the time point of operation may be difficult to decide. Valve replacement in cases of endocarditis may require operating on a septic patient to control the infectious source.
