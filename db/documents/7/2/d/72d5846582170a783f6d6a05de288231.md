Mifepristone works by being an antagonist of glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors. At low doses, mifepristone works by being a selective antagonist of progesterone. It does so by binding to the intracellular progesterone receptor. At high doses, mifepristone blocks cortisol at the glucocorticoid receptor. This action causes an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to an increase in circulating cortisol, thus controlling hyperglycemia in some patients. Mifepristone has a higher affinity for the glucocorticoid II receptor than it does for the glucocorticoid I receptor.

In the instance of pregnancy termination, mifepristone works by interrupting progesterone. Progesterone is the primary hormone in preparing the endometrium for implantation as well as sensitizing the body to the effects of prostaglandins by increasing their synthesis and decreasing their metabolism. The increase in prostaglandins results in menstrual bleeding, disruption of the endometrium, and then termination.
