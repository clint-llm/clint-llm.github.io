In untreated HIV positive women, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases with the fall in CD4 cell counts. Opportunistic infections like CMV and toxoplasmosis can cross the placenta and infect the fetus leading to congenital abnormalities. Also, untreated HIV infection has high chances of being passed on to the newborn in utero, during delivery, or by breastfeeding.

ART regimens themselves are also associated with many complications. Dolutegravir is associated with NTDs, while protease inhibitors have been found to cause preterm birth.
