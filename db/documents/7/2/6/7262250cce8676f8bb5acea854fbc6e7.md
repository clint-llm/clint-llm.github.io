Rarely are papillomas able to cause serious and life-threatening complications. This mainly depends on the anatomical site of the lesion.

- Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis may grow extensively and rapidly in the larynx and upper trachea, causing upper airway obstruction and stridor.

- Choroid plexus papillomas in the brain cause increased cerebrospinal fluid production and can lead to increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus, which may eventually lead to brain herniation and death.

- Papillomas in themselves are rarely premalignant in immunocompetent individuals; however, malignant transformation still does occur.

- A papilloma at the lacrimal punctum may grow into the punctum and canaliculus and involve the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct (inverted papilloma).
