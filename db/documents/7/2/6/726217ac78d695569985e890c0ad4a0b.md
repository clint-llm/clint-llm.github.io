Spontaneous esophageal rupture is caused by a sudden increase in intra-esophageal pressure, leading to a complete transmural tear through the esophagus. The complications will depend on the location of the rupture, as the esophagus abuts different areas of the body.  The mid esophagus lies next to the right pleura while the lower esophagus abuts the left pleura. Rupture occurs most commonly in the left posterolateral wall of the distal third of the esophagus with extension into the left pleural cavity. Intrathoracic esophagus perforations can lead to mediastinal inflammation, emphysema, or necrosis due to gastric contents entering the area.  However, rupture may also occur in the cervical or upper thoracic area. Upper thoracic or mid-esophagus perforations tend to produce pleural effusion or hydropneumothorax on the right. The cervical ruptures are usually more localized and benign as the spread to the mediastinum through the retro-esophageal space is slow and limited.
