Perianal streptococcal dermatitis is an infectious dermatologic disease that typically affects children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years old. The disease is more properly characterized as cellulitis because the most common causative agent is group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Perianal streptococcal dermatitis classically presents as perianal erythema with well-defined margins. Superficial erosions, anal fissures, excoriations, and purulent discharge may also be present. Clinicians can make a definitive diagnosis with a bacterial culture after swabbing the lesion. A combination of oral antibiotics and topical antiseptics is the treatment of choice. The diagnosis of perianal streptococcal dermatitis should merits consideration when encountering a child who has changes in bowel movements and perineal complaints.
