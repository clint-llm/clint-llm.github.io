Although epicondylitis is one of the most prevalent disorders of the arm, medial epicondylitis is much less common than lateral epicondylitis; about 7 to 10 times less common.

Risk factors in the development of medial epicondylitis include smoking, diabetes, obesity, and tasks requiring repetitive wrist flexion or forearm pronation for at least two hours daily.
