Hyperhidrosis can be categorized as either primary or secondary. This distinction is important to make because treatment and management may significantly differ between the two groups. The etiology of primary hyperhidrosis remains unknownÂ despite multiple literature reviews.

Almost any febrile illness can cause hyperhidrosis. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption and tuberculosis are also associated with hyperhidrosis.

Developing segmental or localized hyperhidrosis is rare. The condition can present on the forehead, axilla, palm, feet, or forearm in some adults. Some postmenopausal women develop moderate to severe hyperhidrosis around their face and scalp. Unilateral hyperhidrosis tends to be more common on the right side of the face or arm, with anhidrosis on the left side.
