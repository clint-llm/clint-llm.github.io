Intraocular foreign body (IOFB) is an accidental injury usually resulting from chisel hammering and firearm use. It is a serious ocular condition that can potentially cause permanent vision loss. To avoid the high morbidity associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of an IOFB and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology and review the risk factors for IOFB.
- Summarize the typical presentation of a patient with IOFB.
- Describe the common physical findings in patients with IOFB.
- Review the management considerations for patients with IOFB.
