The prognosis for an individual with a melanoacanthoma is excellent. The skin lesion is non-cancerous. There are no systemic manifestations associated with melanoacanthoma.

Most patients have had their melanoacanthoma removed either during the biopsy or after the diagnosis has been established. Several of these individuals have had clinical follow-up after their melanoacanthoma has been excision. There was no recurrence of the benign neoplasm in nearly all of these individuals.

However, the recurrence or persistence of melanoacanthoma has been described in three individuals. A 54-year-old White woman presented with a 13 by 16 millimeter, black lesion on the bridge of her nose of 18 months duration. The clinical diagnosis of a seborrheic keratosis was considered, and the lesion was removed. Within 6 months after the removal of the melanoacanthoma, the lesion reappeared.

A 65-year-old African-American woman presented with a 2 by 1 centimeter, black plaque on her right preauricular area. An intradermal nevus was suspected clinically, and a superficial shave biopsy was performed. Microscopic examination showed a melanoacanthoma that extended to the deep margin of the specimen. The woman declined further treatment; yet, at follow up several months later, the melanoacanthoma had not only persisted but also increased in size. The residual lesion was completely removed after a deep shave biopsy. There has been no subsequent recurrence after the biopsy site healed.
