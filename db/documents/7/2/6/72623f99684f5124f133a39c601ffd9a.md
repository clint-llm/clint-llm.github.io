Six major cell types form the various layers within the human retina

- Photoreceptors (rods and cones) - form the **outer nuclear layer**
- Synapse with bipolar cells at the outer plexiform layer
- Rods deal predominantly with peripheral and night vision
- Cones deal mainly with central vision

- Bipolar cells - make up the **inner nuclear layer**
- Synapse with amacrine cells and ganglion cells at the inner plexiform layer

- Amacrine cells

- Inhibitory cells which interact with bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells

- Retinal ganglion cells - form the **ganglion cell layer**(innermost layer, furthest from the photoreceptors)
- Axons tract towards the back of the eye and form the **optic nerve**

- Horizontal cells

- Assist in operations such as contrast enhancement and preservation of spatial information.

- Muller cells

- glial cells which support metabolism and homeostasis of the retina.
