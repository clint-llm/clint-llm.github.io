The differential diagnosis of IBS is broad and ultimately depends on whether the patient has predominant diarrhea or constipation.Â  If a patient has IBS with diarrhea, the differentials includes lactose intolerance, caffeine intake, alcohol intake, gastrointestinal infections (Giardia, Amoeba, HIV), inflammatory bowel disease, medication-induced diarrhea (antibiotic use, proton pump inhibitor, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ACE inhibitor, chemotherapy), celiac disease, malignancies, colorectal cancer, hyperthyroidism, VIPoma, and ischemic colitis.
