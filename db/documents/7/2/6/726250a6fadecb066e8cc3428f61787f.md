Overall, forearm fractures have a good prognosis with union rates of approximately 95% to 98%. It has been noted in various studies that the union rate is slightly higher in the case of radius fracture than ulnar fracture.

The outcome of an open fracture depends on the severity and grade of the injury. Open fractures are associated with a high incidence of complications like infection and non-union, which results in a significant increase in morbidity and overall health care cost.
