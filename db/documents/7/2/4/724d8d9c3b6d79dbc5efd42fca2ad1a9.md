Although procalcitonin (PCT) assays have shown promising results over the years, several limitations still require consideration before implementing these tests in everyday clinical practice.

The PCT assay may exhibit interference when a sample is collected from a person consuming a supplement with a high dose of biotin (also termed as vitamin B7 or B8, vitamin H, or coenzyme R).

The cost-effectiveness of PCT assays also needs to be considered, as overuse in the emergency setting leads to extraneous costs. The average price of the test is roughly $9.44, which is relatively inexpensive. However, this cost does not consider the amount that insurance charges, nor does it include sample acquisition costs.

Within the intensive care setting, Kip et al. performed a randomized controlled trial to determine the cost-effectiveness of PCT assays among septic patients. They determined that PCT assays improved mortality rates and decreased the clinical course of antibiotics. However, they found costs for patients tested with PCT assays averaged $2704 greater than patients who did not undergo PCT testing.
