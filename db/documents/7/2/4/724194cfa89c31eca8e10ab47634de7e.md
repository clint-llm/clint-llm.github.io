Generally, with raised intracranial pressure and brainstem compression, the patient is in a coma. On examination, the patient may have abnormal posturing, such as decortication or decerebration. However, with late tonsillar herniation, the patient will have flaccid paralysis. Pupils are likely to be abnormal with varying patterns depending on the underlying pathology. Midbrain compression tends to give midsized and unreactive pupils, while a pontine hemorrhage gives pinpoint and unreactive pupils. If a supratentorial lesion with tentorial herniation occurred first, the patient might have unequal pupils due to oculomotor compression.

Cushing described four stages of intracranial hypertension:

- Compensation - intracranial pressure rises without physiological changes

- Early manifestations - headache and irritability develop

- Maximum manifestation - severe symptoms with raised blood pressure, bradycardia and slowed breathing

- Paralysis - deep coma with low blood pressure and tachycardia before apnea and death
