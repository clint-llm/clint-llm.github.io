Relatively few contraindications exist for the usage of rivastigmine in clinical practice. A patient with a history of hypersensitivity to rivastigmine or other drugs with carbamate derivatives should not be prescribed rivastigmine, and other treatment options should merit consideration. Also, severe reactions to other anticholinergic agents should lead clinicians toÂ monitor for similar effects. Patients who have taken anticholinergic medications before and have experienced a cholinergic crisis should also be wary of a potential repeat using rivastigmine.

Other contraindications include a history of allergic contact dermatitis with patch use.

Caution is advised in patients with the following factors:

- Cardiac conduction conditions

- Bradyarrhythmia or sick sinus syndrome

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma

- Bleeding ulcer history or risk

- Seizure risk or history

- Patient weight under 50 kg
