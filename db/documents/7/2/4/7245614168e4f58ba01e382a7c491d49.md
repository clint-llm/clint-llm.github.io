Treatment for a Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) is often not necessary. Occasionally type I blocks may result in bradycardia leading to hypotension. If hypotension and bradycardia occur, type I blocks respondÂ well to atropine. If unresponsive to atropine, pacing (transcutaneous or transvenous) should be initiated for stabilization.

If the patient is on any beta blockers, calcium channel blockers or digoxin, the dose of these medications should be reduced or the medication discontinued. All patients with Mobitz 1 block should be admitted and monitored.

Treatment for a Mobitz type II involves initiating pacing as soon as this rhythm is identified. Type II blocks imply structural damage to the AV conduction system. This rhythm often deteriorates into complete heart block. These patients require transvenous pacing until a permanent pacemaker is placed. Unlike Mobitz type I (Wenckebach), patients that are bradycardic and hypotensive with a Mobitz type II rhythm often do not respond to atropine.
