History and findings of a clinical examination-that help to diagnose central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia include:

- CCCA usually starts at the vertex of the scalp.

- It progresses centrifugally, usually in a symmetrical fashion.

- The scalp is soft on palpation.

- There can be mild hyperpigmentation seen around the hair follicles.

- The affected patch of alopecia slowly blends with the surrounding normal scalp.

- There may be mild burning, tenderness, or itching confined to the area of hair loss.

- Islands of unaffected hairs with polytrichia can be seen within affected areas.
