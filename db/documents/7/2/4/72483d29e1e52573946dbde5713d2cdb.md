The cerebral hemisphere forms from the telencephalon. The cerebral cortex forms from the roof and lateral aspect of telencephalon forming cerebral hemisphere. Initially, no sulci, gyri are present, but afterÂ six months of intrauterine life, sulci and gyri start appearing. The precentral gyrus forms in front of central sulcus. Cranial nerve motor nuclei formed from the basal plate of the brain stem. Processes of neurons situated in percental gyrus terminating at cranial nerve nuclei directly or indirectly through interneuron form corticobulbar tract.
