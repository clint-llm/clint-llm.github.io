Microscopic colitis is a common cause of chronic watery diarrhea that becomes more common as we age.

Histologic changes define the two types of microscopic colitis. Often this presentation of symptoms will lead to evaluation for other types of inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. The incidence has been increasing throughout northern Europe and northern North America, which is more common in females.
