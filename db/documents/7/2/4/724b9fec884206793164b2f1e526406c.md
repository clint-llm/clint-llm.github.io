Histologic findings in chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities cases from different regions of the world are similar. There is tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and a variable interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. There may be associated global glomerulosclerosis, glomerulomegaly, ischemic-appearing glomerular capillary wall corrugation, and features of vascular injury, including muscular hypertrophy, smooth muscle vacuolization, and intimal proliferation within arteries and arterioles.

The predominant pattern shows chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with argyrophilic granules (identified as lysosomes) in enlarged proximal tubular cells associated with varying degrees of epithelial simplification and tubular atrophy and luminal cell fragment shedding with or without a tubulointerstitial expansion (inflammation, edema, fibrosis).

**Electron microscopy:**Confirmatory diagnosis is established in the presence of enlarged (> 1.2 mm) dysmorphic lysosomes containing electron-dense aggregates. In the absence of enlarged lysosomes, the diagnosis should be suspected if there are two or more clusters of 3 lysosomes that have intra-lysosomal aggregates.
