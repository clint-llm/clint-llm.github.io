The most common cause of lower back pain is not disc injury but is instead muscle strain and muscle fatigue. Modifiable factors that contribute to chronic low back pain include poor ergonomic posture, obesity, and weak core muscles. Some of these structures include the abdominal muscles, thoracic spinal erector muscles, multifidus muscles, and oblique muscles. In addition, muscular and ligamentous support around the vertebral column can help offset axial loads and potentially lessen the impacts associated with disc injuries.
