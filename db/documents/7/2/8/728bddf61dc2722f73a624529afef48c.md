ADPKD patients reach ESRD, on average, in the fifth or sixth decade of life. ADPKD accounts for about 10% of all ESRD cases. Patients with hypertension and larger kidney size tend to have a worse prognosis. A family history of the disease may be predictive of the specific mutation and predictive of the patient's course.
