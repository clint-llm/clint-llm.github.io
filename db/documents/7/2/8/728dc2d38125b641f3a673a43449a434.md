Clinical assessment, review of labs with particular attention to the rate of sodium correction is essential in the evaluation and diagnosis of CPM. Imaging is not required but can be used to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the diagnosis is uncertain. Characteristic findings on magnetic resonance imaging are seen on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), showing diffusion restriction of the central pons with sparing of the periphery. These findings are usually seen within 24 hours of the onset of signs or symptoms. T2 and T2-flair images signal in a “bat-wing” shaped central pontine distribution and are generally seen later in presentation
