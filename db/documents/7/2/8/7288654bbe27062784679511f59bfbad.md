Poikilocytosis is the result of internal damage or external (environmental) trauma. Poikilocytosis causes, generally speaking, it can be inherited or acquired. Inherited conditions can be caused by genetic abnormalities or mutations. Acquired conditions usually develop later in life. The following list provides a general overlay based on etiology.

Inherited causes of poikilocytosis include:

- In sickle cell anemia, RBCs are an abnormal crescent, an elongated spiculated shape known as sickle cells or drepanocytes

- Thalassemia, a genetic disorder in which abnormal hemoglobin is made, contains target cells or codocytes

- Hereditary spherocytosis contains spherocytes

- Pyruvate kinase deficiency contains echinocytes or burr cells

- Hereditary elliptocytosis contains elliptocytes

- McLeod syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that contains acanthocytes

****Acquired causes of poikilocytosis include:

- Iron deficiency anemia, a common type of anemia that is seen when there is insufficient iron in the body, contains elliptocytes (ovalocytes)

- Megaloblastic anemia caused by a deficiency of either folate or vitamin B-12 contains dacrocytes (teardrop cells) and elliptocytes

- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia usually contains schistocytes and spherocytes

- Liver and kidney disease contain echinocytes or burr cells

- Alcohol-related liver disease contains acanthocytes

- Myelofibrosis contains tear drop cells

- Lead poisoning (heavy metals)

- Infections (Plasmodium, Babesia)

Causes based on the type of poikilocytosis:

- Spherocytes: Seen in hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic disorders, red cell fragmentation disorders, hemolytic transfusion reactions, ABO hemolytic diseases of newborn/Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn, hypophosphatemia, bartonellosis, snakebites, hyposplenism.

- Codocytes (target cells): Seen in thalassemia, liver disease (cholestatic type), hemoglobin C disorder, recently splenectomy, autosplenectomy in sickle cell disease, and iron deficiency disorder.

- Sickle cells (drepanocytes): Seen in sickle cell disease.

- Dacrocytes (teardrop cells): Seen in beta-thalassemia, leukemia, hemolytic anemia, myelofibrosis, and megaloblastic anemia.

- Acanthocytes (spur cells): Seen in liver disease, thalassemia, abetalipoproteinemia, splenectomized patients, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, kidney disease, and Mcleod syndrome.

- Schistocytes: Seen in hemolytic anemias, sepsis, burns, disseminated intravascular coagulation, platelet disorders like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.

- Elliptocytes(ovalocytes): Seen in iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, megaloblastic anemia, and myelofibrosis.

- Echinocytes (burr cells): Seen in pyruvate kinase deficiency, kidney disease, and cancer.

- Other nonspecific types are leukocytes, stomatocytes (mouth-shaped cells), and degmacytes (bite cells).
