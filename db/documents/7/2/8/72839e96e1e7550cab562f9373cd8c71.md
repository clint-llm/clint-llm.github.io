Lacerations are seen and managed by many clinicians, including nurse practitioners. However, only those professionals with anatomical and basic surgical knowledge should close lacerations. Even the most simple laceration can become infected or develop into a keloid. Before closing any laceration, the wound must be clean.

Laceration presentation can vary drastically, and while the primary care team can manage simple lacerations, the below guidelines should aid team decision making on when to consult general surgery or other specialty services.

- Guidelines for when to seek surgical consultation:

- Deep wounds of hands or feet
- Full-thickness lacerations of eyelid, lip, or ear
- Lacerations involving nerves, arteries, bones, or joints
- Penetrating wounds of unknown depth
- Severe crush injuries
- Severely contaminated wounds requiring drainage
- Wounds with substantial concern about the cosmetic outcome

There are many instances where a laceration may not be safe to close, and in such situations, a wound care nurse should be involved to follow the patient. These patients require education about wound care and dressing changes. If the nurse notices complications such as infection or dehiscence, they should refer the patient back to the clinician.

Nursing can work with applying and/or changing wound dressings and administering medication for pain control and antimicrobial agents. Pharmacists can make antibiotic recommendations as well as for pain and perform medication reconciliation. If they become infected, the pharmacist should make antibiotic recommendations to the clinician based on local resistance as well as custom and practice.

The outcomes of laceration repair depend on the mechanism, location, and complexity. For optimal outcomes, prompt consultation with a specialist is recommended, and an interprofessional team approach must be leveraged for the best patient care and good outcomes. [Level 5]
