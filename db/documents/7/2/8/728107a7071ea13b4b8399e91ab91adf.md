Educate the patient about illness, and how stress can alter the requirements of medications. Patients should be counseled to take medications as advised and keep an emergency contact card at all times on their mobile phones. Also, patients should be taught how to self-inject with glucocorticoids and to seek help if their blood pressure is low or if they catch any other illness.
