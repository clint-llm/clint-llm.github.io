Pulmonary regurgitation can be seen in several underlying heart and lung conditions, as noted in the etiology. Identifying the underlying cause can be the most challenging aspect and plays a critical role in the management of PR.

Clinically it is very important to distinguish the blowing decrescendo murmur of PR from a similar murmur noticed in aortic regurgitation. PR can sometimes coexist as one of the multivalvular lesions involving mitral and aortic valves. Such cases need further investigations with echocardiography to check the severity of each lesion.
