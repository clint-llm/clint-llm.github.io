Chronic sleep deprivation has been associated with comorbidities, including elevated blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.

Daytime sleepiness resulting from insufficient sleep can increase the risk of motor vehicle accidents.

One study evaluated the effects of three nights of recovery sleep after six nights of sleep restriction and found that inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 levels, cortisol levels, subjective and objective sleepiness, and fatigue levels returned to baseline after sleep recovery. However, daytime performance measures by psychomotor vigilance testing declined significantly after sleep restriction and were not shown to improve after sleep recovery.

Long-term studies assessing the effects of sleepÂ extension on variables such as cardiovascular disease and obesity will provide further insight into the outcomes of untreated sleep deprivation.
