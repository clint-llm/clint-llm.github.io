The basis of treatment for hypnic headaches is typically based on anecdotal evidence. There are no clear-cut studies or answers, and a multitude of medications and interventions have been tried, including oxygen inhalation. Usually, the initial management of this condition begins with caffeine and indomethacin. Melatonin and flunarizine have been effective in a few patients. If those are unsuccessful, lithium has been shown to provide benefit, but it comes with lots of side effects both in the short and long term including nausea, tremor, and kidney/liver dysfunction.
