The available data on the epidemiology of scrub typhus is currently very limited. Fever studies that have been done prospectively in Asia show that scrub typhus is a major cause of non-malarial febrile illnesses. Orientia tsutsugamushi infection is common across Asia, with seroprevalence ranging from 9.3%â€“27.9% and its incidence appears to be increasing.Orientia tsutsugamushi but in the late 1990s use of fluoroquinolones and second and third-generation cephalosporins predominated, and have been ineffective against the same. Another possible reason is that the chigger thrives in hot and humid conditions and with the recent trend of global warming and high humidity during the rainy season posing more to the infection. Changes in human behavior like spending more leisure hours participating in activities such as trekking or camping increase the risk of exposure of the vector in its natural habitat and thus an increased risk of infection.
