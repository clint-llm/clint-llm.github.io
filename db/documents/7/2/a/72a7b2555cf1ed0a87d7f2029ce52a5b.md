Differential diagnoses for reentrant arrhythmias include other tachyarrhythmias. Most reentrant circuits are located above the ventricles; consequently, other supraventricular tachycardias can be confused with reentrant arrhythmias. A 12-lead EKG should be obtained during the tachycardia as well as in sinus rhythm to differentiate these arrhythmias from one another.

Differentials include:

- Sinus tachycardia

- Atrial tachycardia

- Ectopic junctional tachycardia

- Torsades de pointes

- Accelerated atrioventricular rhythm

- Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia
