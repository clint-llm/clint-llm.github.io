Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is caused by a mutation in the CYP27A1 gene. This gene encodes for sterol 27-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for bile acid synthesis. This enzyme's mutation decreases cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, which upregulates 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a precursor to cholestanol synthesis. Due to this mutation, cholesterol cannot be converted into bile acids and is subsequently converted into cholestanol and bile alcohol. A surplus of cholestanol subsequently leads to tissue deposition in various organs, yielding varied manifestations with multi-organ involvement.

Research has demonstrated that as the blood-brain barrier is damaged during the process, cholestanol enters the brain and result in permanent cognitive impairments. Brain atrophy is commonly seen in patients with CTX, raising suspicion on whether cholestanol may have some role in increasing the apoptosis pathways.
