Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is caused by a reduced ability by the immune system to fend off and eradicate human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Since EV was first described in 1922 by Lewandowsky and LutzTMC6/EVER1 or TMC8/EVER2, which is believed to impart a defect in the ability to mount an immune response to certain HPV types within keratinocytes.EVER mutations or EV, these HPV types have not been shown to produce dysplasia or malignancy otherwise.

Malignant transformation of cutaneous epidermal lesions in EV is usually observed in association with HPV5, HPV8, HPV17, HPV20, and HPV47. These lesions usually develop in patients in their 30s, decades after the initial presentation.

In patients with the acquired form of EV, also known as an atypical form, there is usually a history of some form of immunodeficiency, often treatment related. This occurrence of EV in relation to immunodeficiency (other than as occurs in the inherited type) is thought to be specifically due to T-cell mediated immunodeficiency in patients with pre-disposing genetic mutations such as in RHOH and STK4, among others. Not all patients with these mutations who are immunosuppressed will develop EV-like disease. This is much different than typical EV, wherein characteristic mutations are inherited display full penetrance.
