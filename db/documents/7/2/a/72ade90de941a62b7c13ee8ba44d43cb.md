The contraindication for the procedure depends on the presence of variable factors. To better understand the contraindications, it is equally important to understand the resectability criteria. Classically, the three grades of resectability are defined for localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma as resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable.

**A- Localized and Resectable**

No distant metastasis, no radiographic evidence of portal vein (PV) or superior mesenteric vein (SMV) distortion, clear dissection planes around the celiac axis, hepatic artery, and superior mesenteric artery (SMA)

**B- Borderline Resectable**

SMV-PV involvement with distortion, narrowing, occlusion, but the presence of suitable proximal and distal vessels for reconstruction. Gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the hepatic artery with short segment encasement or abutment of the hepatic artery without extending to the celiac axis. Tumor abutment of superior mesenteric artery not extending more than 180 degrees of the vessel wall circumference.

**C- Unresectable for Cancer of the Head (Contraindication of the Procedure)**

- Distance metastasis

- Tumour encasement of SMA more than 180 degrees

- Celiac abutment

- IVCÂ involvement

- Aortic involvement

- Irreparable SMV or PV occlusion.
