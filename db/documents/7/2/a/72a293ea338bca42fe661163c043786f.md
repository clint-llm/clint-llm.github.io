If treated at the onset of pain, discontinuation of activities that cause pain can prevent an overt stress fracture of the proximal humerus's growth plate. Prior to stress fracture occurring, pain often resolves with rest. Once a stress fracture occurs, the pain does not resolve with rest, and the skill level while throwing decreases.

The treatment for Little League shoulder is 3 to 6 months of rest and discontinuation of overhead activity. Treatment can advance to core muscle and rotator cuff strengthening with a physical therapist once there is no pain at rest. Once the range of motion, strength, and scapular motion returns to normal, then a gradual return to throwing by participation in a structured throwing program and subsequent return to competition can follow.

Surgery is not indicated for proximal humeral epiphysiolysis.
