The incidence of transfusion iron overload varies in different regions of the world, depending on the scope of early screening and preventive measures. Among 925 patients with transfusion-dependent-thalassemia, 36.7% had myocardial iron overload, as documented on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a myocardial T2* â‰¤20 milliseconds. Patients in the West and the Far East had a higher iron burden in myocardium compared to the Middle East.
