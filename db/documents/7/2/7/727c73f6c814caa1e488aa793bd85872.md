Leiomyosarcoma staging is according to the organ of origin. Uterine LMS staging is per the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging an extra-uterine LMS gets staged according to the American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) staging. However, the 8th edition of AJCC has resolved a long-standing variability in soft tissue sarcoma staging. In the latest edition, AJCC has provided a separate staging system for STS of retroperitoneum, head/neck region, and extremities/trunk region.

**Grading of Soft Tissue Sarcoma/Leiomyosarcoma**

The College of American Pathologists and the AJCC recommend the three-tiered system of the French Federation of Cancer Centres/Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC). The relative ease of use, well-balanced components including a score for de-differentiation (scored from 1 to 3), mitoses (scored from 1 to 3), and necrosis (scored from 0 to 2), make the French system a suitable scoring system.

Tumor differentiation

- 1- Closely resemble normal adult mesenchymal tissue

- 2- Histologic typing is uncertain

- 3- Embryonal or undifferentiated sarcoma, sarcoma of doubtful type, synovial sarcoma, soft tissue osteosarcoma, Ewing Sarcoma/Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of soft tissue

Mitotic Count- measured in the most mitotically active area of sarcoma, ten successive HPF are assessed using a 40x objective.

- 1- 0-9 mitosis/HPF

- 2- 10-19 mitosis/HPF

- 3- more than 20/HPF

Tumor Necrosis

- 0- No necrosis

- 1- Less than 50% necrosis

- 2- More than 50% necrosis

Grading system: This is a cumulative score given to the sarcoma after assessing the tumor differentiation, mitotic count, and tumor necrosis. For example, an LMS tumor with a differentiation sore of 1, a mitotic count score of 1, and a tumor necrosis score of 0 is a grade 2 (1 + 1 + 0) tumor.

- GX – grade cannot be assessed

- G1 – total score = 2–3

- G2 –total score = 4–5

- G3 – total score = 6–8

**AJCC 8th Edition Staging for STS of Extremities and Trunk**

TNM staging:

- Tumor staging (T):

- T1: Tumor less than or equal to 5 cm in greatest dimension
- T2: Tumor over 5 cm and less than or equal to 10 cm in greatest dimension 
- T3: Tumor over 10 cm and less than or equal to 15 cm in greatest dimension
- T4: Tumor over 15 cm in greatest dimension

- Node staging (N):

- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis or unknown lymph node status
- N1: Regional lymph node metastasis

- Metastasis staging (M):

- M0: No distant metastasis
- M1: Distant metastasis

Stage groups:

- Stage I

- Stage IA: T1; N0; M0; G1
- Stage IB: T2, T3, T4; N0; M0; G1

- Stage II: T1; N0; M0; G2/3

- Stage III

- Stage IIIA: T2; N0; M0; G2/3 
- Stage IIIB: T3, T4; N0; M0; G2/3

- Stage IV: Any T; N1; M0; any G Any T; any N; M1; any G

**AJCC 8th Edition Staging for****Retroperitoneum**:****

- The staging of STS of the retroperitoneum is very similar to the staging system used for extremities and trunk. The only difference is that in the patients with STS of the retroperitoneum, the N1 node-positive patients are classified under stage IIIB, whereas in the STS of the extremities and trunk, they fall under stage IV.

**AJCC 8th Edition Staging for Head and Neck**

There are no staging groups in the head/neck region in AJCC 8th edition as it would need the application of the French grading system, and very extensive lesions (T4) remain unclassified.

- T Category

- T1: less than or equal to 2 cm
- T2: greater than 2 but less than or equal to 4 cm
- T3: greater than 4 cm
- T4: Invasion of adjoining structures

- T4a: Invasion of the orbit, skull base, dura, central compartment viscera, pterygoid muscles, or facial skeletal involvement
- T4b: Invasion of brain parenchyma, the involvement of the central nervous system via the perineural spread, invasion of prevertebral muscle, or carotid artery encasement

- N Category

- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
- N1: Regional lymph node metastasis

- M Category

- M0: No distant Metastasis
- M1: Distant metastasis

**FIGO Staging for Uterine Leiomyosarcoma**

FIGO staging for uterine sarcomas (2009).

- Stage I- Tumor limited to the uterus

- IA: Less than 5 cm in greatest dimension
- IB: More than 5 cm in greatest dimension

- Stage II- Tumor extends beyond the uterus, within the pelvis

- IIA: Adnexal involvement
- IIB: Involvement of other pelvic tissues

- Stage III- Tumor invades abdominal tissues

- IIIA: 1 site
- IIIB: more than one site
- IIIC: Involves pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes

- Stage IV - tumor invades pelvic organs and/or distant metastasis

- IVA Invasion of bladder or rectum
- IVB Distant metastases
