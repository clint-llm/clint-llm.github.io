Small tumors frequently require minimal reconstruction with good preservation of oral function. However, in more advanced disease, rehabilitation becomes a challenge. Ideal rehabilitation includes restoring the external appearance, dentition, mastication, speech, and swallow function. With more advanced reconstructions leading to loss of part of the mandible, restoration of dentition and masticatory function was classically achieved with the use of removable prosthesis with suboptimal results. This has now been largely replaced with the use of dental implants in patients with free flap mandibular reconstructions. Optimal rehabilitation in the oral cancer patient will thus rely on effective teamwork and communication between speech and language pathologists, dental specialists, and oncologic surgeons.
