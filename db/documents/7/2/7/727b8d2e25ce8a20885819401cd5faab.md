Imipramine is a tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressant. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as antidepressants in the 1950s. Although it is FDA approved for the treatment of depression, it is a second-line treatment, notably in severe depression with melancholic and atypical features due to its undesirable side effects and its toxicity in overdose. Imipramine is an adjunctive therapy in nocturnal enuresis in children above six years of age. There are other off-label uses of imipramine as in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and panic disorder.
