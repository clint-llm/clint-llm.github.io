Selenium is a trace mineral that is essential to human health. Selenium, in the form of selenoproteins, carries out various functions in normal health and metabolism. In particular, glutathione peroxidase, a selenoprotein, performs antioxidant activities that protect against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Iodothyronine deiodinases that convert inactive thyroxine to active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine, are selenium-dependent. Selenium plays a role in the immune system functioning and the progression of HIV to AIDS. Selenium deficiency has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, infertility, myodegenerative diseases, and cognitive decline. The role of selenium in cancer treatment is currently being studied. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of selenium deficiency and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of selenium deficiency.
- Describe the typical presentation of selenium deficiency.
- Describe the treatment of selenium deficiency.
- Explain the importance of enhancing coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with selenium deficiency.
