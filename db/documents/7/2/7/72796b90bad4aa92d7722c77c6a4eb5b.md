Rufinamide is available as a suspension of 40 mg/mL.

Rufinamide administration iv via twice-daily dosing. In children, it is started at 10 mg/kg/day and is gradually increased by 10 mg/kg every other day to 45 mg/kg/day or 3200 mg/day (whichever is less). In adults, the dosing regimen begins with 400 to 800 mg/day, gradually increasing by 400 to 800 mg every other day, up to a maximum of 3200 mg/day. Rufinamide is administered orally and is available in two formulations: Film-coated tablets (200 mg, 400 mg) and oral suspension (40 mg/ml). If on valproic acid, the US labeling recommends that the initial rufinamide dose be 400 mg daily (<10 mg/kg/day) due to the enzyme inhibition effects of valproic acid.

Rufinamide has a slow absorption (T-max 4 to 6 hours) andÂ exhibits bioavailability of up to 85%.

Patients with renal impairment will require no dosing adjustments. Clinicians can give 30% of the usual dose as a post-dialysis supplement for hemodialysis patients. Peritoneal dialysis dosing is undefined. Caution is advised in pati4nts with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; with severe impairment, the recommendation is to avoid using rufinamide.
