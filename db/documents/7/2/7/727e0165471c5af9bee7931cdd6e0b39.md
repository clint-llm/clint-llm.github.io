According to the WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen published in 2010, semen analysis involves the following steps:

In the first 5 minutes, liquefaction of the specimen is performed by placing the sample on an incubator at 37 degrees Celsius or on the bench. Allowing time for liquefaction helps semen to become more homogenous and watery, with only some areas of coagulation. Spermatozoa that are immobilized in the coagulum gain the ability to move. Liquefaction can take up to 60 minutes. If liquefaction does not happen on its own, reagents can be used to facilitate the process, but this can also affect the composition of the seminal plasma, sperm motility, and morphology and needs to be noted.

The semen volume needs to be measured. Following this, semen pH is measured, and wet preparations are made. Wet preparations help assess the appearance, motility, and dilution required to optimally assess the number of spermatozoa. Attention should be paid to the presence of agglutination of spermatozoa, where motile sperms are stuck to one another. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies must be considered in such situations. Agglutination can affect sperm motility and concentration. Sperm motility is best tested within an hour of collection.

Sperm vitality is assessed, especially if the sperm number is low. The integrity of the cell membranes helps identify if the immotile sperms are dead or alive.  The semen is diluted to assess the sperm number. Tests for sperm antibodies such as the mixed antiglobulin reaction test, immunobead test, checking for peroxidase positive cells, and similar biochemical tests are performed as needed. The semen needs to be sent to the microbiology laboratory within 3 hours of collection if needed. Finally, smears are prepared to study sperm morphology after 4 hours. Properly done semen analyses are relatively labor-intensive and can be complex, so the best results are obtained in laboratories that perform these tests regularly.
