Care of the patient with an antalgic gait often spans many disciplines and is best accomplished with an interprofessional team approach. This team may include primary care clinicians, emergency clinicians, orthopedic and spine surgeons, vascular surgeons, rheumatologists, and infectious disease specialists. Physical therapists can be very helpful in the long-term management of many of the conditions leading to an antalgic gait.
