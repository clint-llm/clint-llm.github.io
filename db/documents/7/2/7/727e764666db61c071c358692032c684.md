Complications from untreated scoliosis include deformity progression. This can generate back pain, lumbar radiculopathy, cosmetic problems, nerve damage, and even cardiac and pulmonary restriction. Untreated patients with a curve of more than 80 degrees in the coronal plane can have increased shortness of breath.

Surgical complications are generally lower than in adult spinal deformity surgery but present. One national data series estimated the post-surgical neurologic injury at 0.9%, respiratory complications  at  2.8%, cardiac complications at 0.8%, infection at 0.5%, and 2.7% for gastrointestinal complications. Delayed infections in the hardware are also common.

Surgeon expertise and volume of surgery are also important factors regarding the outcome and cost of surgery.
