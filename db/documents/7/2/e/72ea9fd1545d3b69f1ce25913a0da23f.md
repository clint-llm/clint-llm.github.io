Three primary mechanisms contribute to the development of the scleroderma: vascular anomalies, excess fibrosis, and autoimmune phenomenon.

Abnormal interactions between endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes (B and T) lead to microcirculatory vascular involvement. The endothelial cells produce large amounts of endothelin 1, causing vasoconstriction and fibroblast activation. Also, fibroblasts and activated endothelial cells produce reactive oxygen species that speed up vascular remodeling, leading to the obliteration of small vessels. Activated fibroblasts differentiate easily into myofibroblasts, which have increased collagen synthesis ability.
