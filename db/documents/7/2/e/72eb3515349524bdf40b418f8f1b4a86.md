Endothelin is a 21-amino acid long peptide that is a vasoconstrictor produced from endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), macrophages, and the renal medulla. They are known to produce endothelin-1 (ET-1) that acts on the receptors ETA and ETB. These receptors are G-protein coupled cell-surface receptors, and ETA is mainly present on smooth muscle cells. ETB receptors appear on endothelial and renal epithelial cells. Both are present in the lungs. ET-1 is known as a potent vasoconstrictor with proliferative, pro-fibrotic, pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory properties, and maintenance of the tone of VSMC’s. Other ET’s discovered include ET-2 and ET-3. Endothelins are involved in neurovascular uncoupling, affects cognitive functions and blood pressure. Its influence of blood pressure is an essential part of diseases such as postmenopausal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and pulmonary hypertension in which it plays a major role in its pathogenesis and hence is a vital cornerstone for appropriate management.
