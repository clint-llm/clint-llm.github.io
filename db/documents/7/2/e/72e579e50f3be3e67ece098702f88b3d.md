Human immunodeficiency virus is highly mutatable due to the lack of proofreading capability of viral reverse transcriptase, which creates a higher risk for the development of drug resistance. Viral genetic testing should take place to monitor the occurrence of drug resistance, especially when the viral titer increases.

Research has reported first-degree AV block in patients treated with ritonavir and atazanavir co-administration. An electrocardiogram is necessary for patients who have pre-existing conduction diseases or simultaneously take medications that may cause PR prolongation.

Delayed hypersensitivity to atazanavir or any of its components may develop. A mild rash may often develop but can disappear after 1 to 2 weeks and does not require stopping atazanavir. However, the development of serious reactions to the drug requires monitoring, especially the development of a severe rash, flu-like symptoms, fever, muscle or joint aches, conjunctivitis, blisters, mouth sores, facial swelling, painful/inflamed skin lesions.

Clinicians should monitor the development of acute immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

Drug interactions with co-administrated medications should require monitoring, as do hepatic function and renal function. Signs of hepatic impairment include hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes in the serum, jaundice, dark-colored urine, light-colored bowel movements, nausea, itching, and abdominal pain.
