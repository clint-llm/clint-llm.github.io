The human factors have demonstrated  important role in the development of simulation to optimize performance. Therefore, the principles of human factors and ergonomics can be applied to improve human and system performance.

The human factors should be integrated into simulation-based education to make it more relevant to clinical practice.

The human factors are more relevant in emergency medicine simulation, particularly when there is limited time to think and therefore can significantly influence outcome.
