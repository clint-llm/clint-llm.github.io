The pediatric population demands careful consideration of a child’s size in determining their rate of fluid maintenance. A 3-month-old infant has much different fluid needs than those of a more fully grown 8-year-old child. In many cases, a simple calculation called the 4-2-1 rule can determine the hourly rate of fluid maintenance required for a child based on weight.

- First 10 kg = 4 mL/kg per hour

- Next 10-20 kg = 2 mL/kg per hour

- Any remaining weight over 20 kg = 1 mL/kg per hour.

For example, a 22kg child would have the following maintenance fluid requirements.

- First 10 kg = 4 mL/kg per hour x 10 kg = 40 mL per hour

- Next 10-20 kg = 2 mL/kg per hour x 10 kg= 20 mL per hour

- Remaining 2 kg = 1 mL/kg per hour x 2 kg = 2 mL per hour

- Total hourly rate = 40 + 20 + 2 = 62 mL per hour

Another commonly used formula predicts fluid needs over a 24-hour period. The following example shows an application of this formula.

- First 10 kg = 100 ml/kg per day

- Next 10 to 20 kg = additional 50 mL/kg per day

- Any remaining weight over 20 kg = additional 20 mL/kg per day

For example, a 70-kg man would have the following maintenance fluid requirements.

- First 10 kg = 100 ml/kg/day x 10 kg = 1000 mL per day

- Next 10 to 20 kg = 50 ml/kg/day x 10 kg = 500 mL per day

- Remaining 50 kg = 20 ml/kg/day x 50 kg = 1000 mL per day

- Total fluids per day = 1000 + 500 + 1000 = 2500 mL per day

- Hourly fluid rate = 2500/24 = 104 mL per hour

One must exercise caution in applying these weight-based formulae to patients who are elderly or obese.
