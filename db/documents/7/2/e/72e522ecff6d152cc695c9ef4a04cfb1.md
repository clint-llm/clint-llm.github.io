Given the wide variety of disorders that can cause hemiballismus, a good medical history, and physical evaluation can pinpoint or narrow the diagnosis without requiring any ancillary studies. Old patients with multiple vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, previous strokes) would need advanced vessel imaging to confirm any hemorrhage or stroke, and if positive, would need a thorough stroke workup.

Thorough routine serum labs, depending on suspected etiology, can include a complete metabolic panel (CMP) and complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin A1C, serum osmolality, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), extranuclear antibody (ENA), vitamin panel (e.g., B1, B12, etc.), ceruloplasmin, copper level, other heavy metals, drugs of abuse toxicology, HIV antibody screen (if positive opportunistic infection screen), lupus antibodies (C3/C4, double-stranded DNA, anti-histone), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) studies, cryoglobulin, among other immune and infectious markers.

A contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography angiogram (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) may be used to evaluate for autoimmune pathology, structural abnormalities, or malignancy.

If neuroinfectious (opportunistic bacterial, viral-HIV, or fungal-toxoplasmosis) or neuroinflammatory/paraneoplastic etiology is suspected, a lumbar puncture with extensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) basic and advanced studies (oligoclonal bands, CSF index), including flow cytology and cytometry should be obtained. Genetic studies should be sent when indicated, and there is a strong clinical suspicion for a hereditary etiology.
