Periapical cysts generally have a good prognosis following treatment. Prognostic variables include but are not limited to the tooth affected, the size of the cyst, and the extent to which the bone is damaged.

Residual cysts have an excellent prognosis and should not recur if adequately treated.

Paradental cysts have an excellent prognosis with no reports of recurrence.

Dentigerous cysts have an excellent prognosis if treated appropriately. Their recurrence rate is relatively low; however, without complete enucleation or curettage at the time of the extraction, they can recur.

Eruption cysts have a good prognosis. They are commonly self-limiting, as the erupting tooth often ruptures the cyst.

Lateral periodontal cysts have a good prognosis with a meager recurrence rate.

Odontogenic keratocysts have a favorable to fair prognosis. Their recurrence may range from 20-62%, depending on the type of treatment rendered. With aggressive treatment options, such as resection, recurrences have not been reported.

Orthokeratinizing odontogenic cysts have a good prognosis with a reported recurrence rate as low as 2%.

Glandular odontogenic cysts have a favorable to fair prognosis with a relatively high recurrence rate of 20 to 30%. The potential for multiple recurrences is high; therefore, close long-term follow-up is recommended.
