A plica is a band of thick, fibrotic tissue that extends from the synovial capsule of a joint. Plica can be present in multiple joints, but this article will review plica in the knee which is the joint most commonly affected by plica tissue. As a result of overuse or injury, plica can become inflamed or irritated due to friction across the patella or the medial femoral condyle. When the plica becomes inflamed or irritated, it can cause plica syndrome, which is anterior knee pain due to the plica.
