The appearance of basophilic stippling on light microscopy of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates is characteristic of its namesake. Affected erythrocytes demonstrate small, basophilic (purple-blue) punctate inclusions. Unlike other erythrocyte inclusions, basophilic stippling does not show polarity and is diffusely and evenly scattered throughout the cell. The inclusions may be coarse or fine in appearance, and these different morphologies can be associated with particular disease processes as discussed later.
