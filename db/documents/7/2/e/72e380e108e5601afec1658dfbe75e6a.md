- Nystatin is associated with mucositis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome

- Oral fluconazole and clotrimazole troches may cause liver function test elevation and, rarely, hepatotoxicity.

- Proton pump inhibitors decreased systemic azole absorption by raising gastric pH

- Triazoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole) are inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome P450. All inhibit CYP3A4 and increase levels of the following drugs. Fluconazole and Ketoconazole also inhibit CYP2C8/9. Caution should be used with the list of drugs below.  Consideration should be given to substituting amphotericin or nystatin for a triazole.

- Vinca alkaloids
- Steroids (methylprednisolone and dexamethasone)
- Statins
- Protease inhibitors
- Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors
- Phenytoin decreased the dose and monitor serum levels with fluconazole and itraconazole
- Felodipine cut the dose by 50%
- Digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels
- Cyclosporine, decrease dose by 50% and monitor serum cyclosporine levels
- Carbamazepine, only in azole doses over 200 mg per day
- Benzodiazepines, reduce the dose
