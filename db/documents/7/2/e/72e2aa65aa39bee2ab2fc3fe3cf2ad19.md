The diagnosis and management of chondromalacia patella are complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes an orthopedic surgeon, emergency department physician, sports physician, physical therapist, nurse practitioners/PAs, rheumatologist, and nursing staff. Once diagnosed, management is difficult because no single treatment works consistently in all patients. Nonsurgical therapy is usually the first step. If that fails, PRP and prolotherapy may be other options. Surgery is undertaken when conservative measures fail. However, the surgery does not always result inÂ positive outcomes, and a significant number of patients continue to complain of pain.
