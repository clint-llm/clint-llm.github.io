Nasopalatine duct cysts can be expansile in nature and may result in drainage intraorally. These lesions can be caused by mucous retention and inadequate drainage, leading to pain or pressure symptoms as the lesion expands.

Nasolabial cysts may present clinically as both non-odontogenic and odontogenic lesions. Thus the histological analysis is key to the diagnosis.

Palatal cysts of the newborn spontaneously rupture and present with no complications.

Oral lymphoepithelial cysts typically do not present with complications once removed. There is no recurrence after excision.

Epidermoid cysts that become larger in size have the potential to result in complications, such as difficulty with breathing and/or speech.
