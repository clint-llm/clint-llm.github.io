Hip osteoarthritis is one of the most common causes of debilitating pain in the general population. A recent study estimates the rise in mean prevalence from 4.0% in the 1970s to 8.6% in the 2000s, with men accounting for a higher prevalence before age 50 and women having a higher prevalence after age 50.Â Hip osteoarthritis is treated in a stepwise manner, utilizing non-operative treatment options including weight loss, activity modification, physical therapy, assisted ambulatory devices (i.e., cane, walker), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections. The use of needle lavage, acupuncture, glucosamine and chondroitin supplementation, viscoelastic joint injections, growth factor injections, and platelet-rich plasma injections remains controversial. When non-operative treatment modalities have been exhausted, total hip arthroplasty is the operative treatment of choice.
