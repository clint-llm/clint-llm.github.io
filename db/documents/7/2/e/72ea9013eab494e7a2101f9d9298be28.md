Factor V is a cofactor glycoprotein required in both the coagulation and anticoagulation pathways. The fate ofÂ factor V, whether it goes down the coagulation pathway or the anticoagulation pathway, depends on modification by either activated factor X or aPC. In modification by activated factor X or thrombin to activated factor V, and then binding activated factor X to produce the prothrombinase complex, it aids in coagulation to produce a fibrin clot. In modification by aPC to factor Vac and then binding aPC, it assists in the degradation of activated factor VIII to inhibit further coagulation. aPC resistance is affected by the functionality and presence of factor Vac. The most common point mutation leading to increased aPC resistance is a missense mutation resulting in Arg506Gln.
