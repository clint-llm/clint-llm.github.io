Osteoporosis is commonly encountered in older women with no underlying risk factors. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is attributed only to old age.

Many diseases have strong evidence to be considered as risk factors attributing to the development of osteoporosis, even in the young female population. These include conditions like hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, celiac disease, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), ankylosing spondylosis. Smoking is an important modifiable risk factor besides high alcohol intake.

It is always a good clinical practice to advise women to quit smoking and reduce their alcohol intake.

Vitamin D is essential for managing bone strength and calcium absorption. It is a significant factor considered as an additional risk for osteoporosis in countries lacking tropical weather, which is vital for vitamin D synthesis.

Other contributing factors to the development of osteoporosis are the judicious use of certain medications, known as secondary risk factors for osteoporosis. Important to mention are corticosteroids, thyroxine, antacids, and chemotherapies, especially aromatase inhibitors.
