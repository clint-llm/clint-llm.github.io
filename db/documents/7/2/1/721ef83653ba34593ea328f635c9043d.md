**Sciatic nerve**

The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and forms from the conglomeration of fibers from L4 to S3 that then course deep to the piriformis before passing through the greater sciatic foramen to exit the pelvis. It travels down the posterior thigh through the popliteal fossa, where it splits into the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve.

**Superior gluteal nerve**

Formed by the dorsal fibers of L4 to S1, it leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen and is the only nerve to exit via this foramen above the piriformis. Tracking along with the superior gluteal artery and vein, it innervates the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus along with the tensor fascia lata.

**Inferior gluteal nerve**

Arising from the dorsal branches of L5 to S2 leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen running under the piriformis before branching into and supplying the gluteus maximus.

**The nerve to internal obtu****rator and superior gemellus muscles:**

Formed from L5 to S2 fibers, it exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen to supply the muscles in its name.

**The nerve to quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus muscles:**

Formed from L4 to S1 fibers, it descends along the ischium and posterior to the hip joint before supplying the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus.
