There are many etiologies of coma, but regardless of the cause, the basic initial treatment is similar for all. These patients may require care of many organ systems and an interprofessional team approach is essential. One European system has developed a “coma alarm” for the early involvement of a multidisciplinary team of specialists.

Unless the altered mental status improves, patients with coma need attention in the ICU since many will need respiratory support. Very few long-term data are available on people who survive coma. While short-term prognosis varies from good to poor depending on the etiology, sometimes full recovery may take months or years. Two negative prognostic factors include the depth of coma as well as the duration. The cause of the comatose state is the most important variable. Some patients may remain in a persistent vegetative state or other chronic minimally responsive states, and the recovery of these individuals is variable.

Current recommendations are that once a patient has developed prolonged coma or other unresponsive states, a team of healthcare professionals should determine the prognosis. If a determination of futile treatment is made, this should be communicated to the family. Life support should not be withdrawn until one is entirely sure that recovery is not possible. Prematurely deciding to end life can lead to medicolegal disputes and tarnish the reputation of the healthcare providers.
