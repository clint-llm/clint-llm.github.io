The most common mechanism of injury for Boxer’s fracture is punching, e.g., the axial pressure applied to the metacarpal bone when the fist is in a clenched position. Direct trauma to the dorsum of the hand may also cause a fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck. Unlike many other hand and wrist fractures, a Boxer’s fracture typically does not occur with a fall onto an outstretched hand.
