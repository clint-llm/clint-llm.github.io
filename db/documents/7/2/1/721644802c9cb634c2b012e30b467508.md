Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be distinguished from secondary osteonecrosis of the knee by its insidious onset and lack of identifiable cause.

In 2019, Hussain et al. published a systematic review re-examining the proposed etiologies of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee to understand the pathogenesis of the disease better. Here, the investigators noted a strong association between meniscal tears and spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee.Â  Meniscal tears were found to occur in 50 to 100% of patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee in the included studies, with the extent of medial meniscus extrusion correlating to the stage and volume of SONK lesions.
