Spondylolisthesis can result in accelerated degeneration of the intervertebral disc which can lead to diminished height of the neural foramen and increased stresses on the facet joints posteriorly.  This increased stress can lead to hypertrophy of the facet and ligamentum flavum.  These changes can result in back pain, neurogenic claudication and radiculopathy. The radicular symptoms of isthmic spondylolisthesis are typically caused by the foraminal stenosis.  Since the level most commonly affected is L5-S1, the L5 exiting nerve root in the L5-S1 foramen can be compressed.  Other causes of symptoms can include lateral recess stenosis which, for example, can be caused by facet arthrosis or hypertrophied ligamentum flavum.  Even more rare would be symptoms caused by central stenosis, given that most of these spondylolistheses rarely progress beyond grade II, and as the vertebral body translates anteriorly, the posterior elements tend to remain with the caudal vertebra maintaining their normal anatomic alignment.
