The patient should meet the usual criteria for undergoing an elective surgical procedure. There is no specific age limit, provided the patient is in reasonable health. Medical conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, should be controlled. Smokers should be encouraged to quit a couple of weeks before surgery and must be informed of the increased risks of flap necrosis, nipple-areolar complex loss, and problems with wound healing. A mammogram should be obtained on those over 40 years of age or with a family history of breast cancer. Any suspicious findings should be addressed by a surgical oncologist before undertaking elective breast reduction.
