Many staging systems exist for prognostication of acute pancreatitis. Today the Atlanta classification is used to differentiate between acute and severe cases of acute pancreatitis, which includes the following:

- Presence of local complications- abscess, necrosis, or pseudocyst

- Evidence of organ injury (SBP less than 90, Cr more than 2, or GI bleeding more than 500 ml)

- Ranson score of 3 or greater or APACHE score of 8 or higher
