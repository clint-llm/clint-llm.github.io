In severe polyhydramnios, maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists should be consulted for antenatal testing to include ultrasound evaluation for anatomic abnormalities, serial growth scans for macrosomia or fetal growth restriction, non-reassuring stress testing for fetal assessment, assessment of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity measurement to assess for fetal anemia, management of twin-twin transfusion syndrome, the potential need for indomethacin and reductive amniocentesis for symptomatic polyhydramnios, and recommendations for timing of delivery. Fetal surgery consultation is indicated for laser therapy to treat severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome. A multi-professional team should manage pregnantÂ women with polyhydramnios, including neonatologists, pediatric pulmonologists, cardiologists, fetal medicine specialists, obstetric providers, nurses, and midwives.
