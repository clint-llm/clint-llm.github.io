Patients need to understand that most cases will not require surgery. They may need to wear a neck collar to limit movement to promote healing and prevent further injury. More commonly, they will require halo immobilization.

Less commonly, the patient will require surgery. All aspects of the procedure need to be explained to the patient, and they should receive reassurance regarding the high degree of successful recovery following surgery, as cited above. They should also be given realistic expectations regarding recovery time, lasting as long as a year.
