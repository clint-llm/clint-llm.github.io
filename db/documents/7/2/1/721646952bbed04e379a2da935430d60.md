Ongoing monitoring of medications (in particular, weaning off medications for symptom reduction as rehabilitation progresses) is required by an administering physician with the assistance of the treating practitioner, depending on patient progress. Collaboration between referring physicians and therapy services is also indicated to monitor patient progression and to seek alternative treatments should conservative treatments fail.

Collaboration is also crucial in adherence to vestibular rehab, as it has been shown that compliance, as well as the ability to perform techniques, is poor without facilitation. Medical and technology professionals are working to improve web-based programs to facilitate improved home exercise programs in the future but are currently in preliminary stages.
