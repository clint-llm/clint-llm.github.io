The orbital atherectomy system (OAS) comprises the following components:  coronary orbital atherectomy device (OAD), orbital atherectomy system pump, coronary guidewire, and lubricant. The OAD consists of a sheath-covered drive shaft, a 1.25/1.50 mm crown that slides over the VIPERWIRE coronary guidewire, a crown advancer knob, and a saline tubing connection to the OAS pump. A tableside motor handle controls crown rotation speed, guides crown advancement, and contains the guidewire brake leaver.

A minimum size 6 french guide or larger is needed for the use of the OAS. The lubricant combined with saline is attached to the pump and must always be utilized during OA to help reduce the risk of thermal injury and potential heart block.
