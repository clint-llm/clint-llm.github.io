Electrical injuries are when high-energy current travels through the body due to contact with an electrical source. Injuries occur due to either the flow of current through the body, arc flash, or clothing that catches fire. With the former two, the body converts electricity to heat, which results in a thermal burn. It is important to consider that the outward appearance of an electrical burn does not accurately predict the true extent of the injury, as internal tissues or organs may be much more severely burned than the skin. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment options available for electrical burns and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of electrical burns.
- Summarize the steps in the evaluation of a patient with an electrical burn.
- Review the treatment and management options available for electrical burns.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by electrical burns.
