Prevention of leech bites includes avoiding leech infested areas and wearing clothing that covers the lower extremities. If swimming in a potential leech-infested pond, wear tight-fitting swimwear. Insect repellents such as N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide or N, N-diethyl phenylacetamide have also been suggested.
