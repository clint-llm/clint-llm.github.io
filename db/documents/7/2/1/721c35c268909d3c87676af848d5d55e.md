With the worldwide burden of LBP clearly documented, it is an important medical topic and can be thought of as almost a public health crisis.  With LBP being a clinical syndrome with heterogeneity in terms of presentations, etiologies, histories, and exam findings, objective information is always needed.  Finding the appropriate vertebral levels involved in a patient's symptoms can allow for better outcomes and determines the appropriate course of treatment, workup, management, evaluation, and decision-making process regarding lumbar spine surgery, particularly fusion.

For improved outcomes, interactions between spine surgeons, neurologists, interventional pain management physicians, as well as physical therapists, and other allied health professionals can and should include data obtained during provocative discography and post-discogram CT scanning.  This is important to plan surgeries, minimally invasive procedures, and therapies for the patient. Primary care physicians and physician extenders are crucial in obtaining an initial history and physical exams, emphasizing common "red flag" symptoms and neurological deficits.

In the initial post-procedure period, pain control and monitoring for any post-procedural complications should consist of basic neuro checks and vital signs.  Although rare, later monitoring should consist of observation for constitutional signs or symptoms of fevers, chills, and increasing LBP.  Restarting anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet therapy under appropriate guidance may be indicated depending on the clinical scenario. Clinical follow-up should include actually reviewing the objective and subjective data obtained from the discograms as part of integrated care.

In general, the need for meticulous planning and discussion with other professionals involved in managing the patient is highly recommended to lower the rate of complications and improve clinical outcomes.
