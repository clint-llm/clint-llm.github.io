Complications for adult spinal deformity range from 10.5% to 96%. The prospective multicenter Scoli-RISK-1 Study noted an immediate decline in lower extremity motor strength in 22.18% of patients undergoing complex spinal deformity surgery for adult scoliosis. At six months, this largely improved, with 20.52% noting an improvement in preoperative strength at 10.82% showing an improvement. Revision spinal surgery increases these risks.

Three-column osteotomy by nature of the spinal deformity and the invasiveness of the procedure has an increased complication rate. In one series from the International Spine Study Group, 78.0% of patients had complications following three-column osteotomy for adult deformity. Sixty-one percent of patients had a significant complication. Another study illustrated that 108 adults treated with aÂ PSO for kyphotic deformity had an 11.1% rate of neurologic deficit. In children, Lenke et al. found a 40% overall rate of complications and an 11.4% rate of neurological complications.

Complications can include iatrogenic injury to the spinal cord, nerves, durotomy, infection, or pseudomeningocele. It also can include injury to the neighboring structures such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, large vessel injury, abdominal injury, or medical sequelae such as deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, or pneumonia.

Following the surgery, the patient must be monitored for instrumentation failure as well as the development of proximal junctional kyphosis or proximal junctional failure.
