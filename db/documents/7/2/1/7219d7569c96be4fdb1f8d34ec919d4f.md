An in-depth history and physical exam are important in establishing the diagnosis of E. coli infection. Symptom onset, duration, and severity, as well as any alleviating and aggravating factors, including any over-the-counter medications trialed, may help distinguish it from other intestinal illnesses. It is especially important to distinguish between watery and bloody diarrhea and to ask about recent travel and diet history, which may provide clues to suggest E. coli as the etiology of illness. ETEC is the most common bacterial cause of traveler's diarrhea, and management relies on high clinical suspicion. Symptoms usually start more than 16 hours after the ingestion of contaminated food, whereas diarrheal illness caused by organisms other than E. coli may have onset much more rapidly. If a patient presents with an extraintestinal manifestation of E. coli, it's essential to ask about prior infections and assess for the risk of drug-resistant organisms. When a patient presents with symptoms consistent with cystitis, it's also important to know about indwelling instrumentation, such as ureteral stents or Foley catheters.

The physical exam allows health practitioners to assess the severity of illness. Patients presenting with vital signs suggestive of systemic disease should be cared for in an appropriate setting, such as a hospital-based emergency department or in-patient ward where comprehensive care can be provided. All patients should be assessed for clinical signs of dehydration by evaluating mucous membranes and skin turgor. Clinicians should auscultate the heart and lungs in all patients suspected of disease caused by E. coli. Finally, a focused exam should support the patient-provided history that may yield additional findings to guide patient care. Patients presenting with intestinal and genitourinary symptoms should have a thorough abdominal exam performed, whereas patients suspected of having sepsis caused by E. coli should undergo a comprehensive physical exam.
