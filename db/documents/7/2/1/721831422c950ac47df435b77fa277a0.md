In order to improve health outcomes for patients, practitioners should recognize that yersinia enterocolitica has an acute diarrheal form of infection as well as pseudoappendicitis which mimics appendicitis (both requiring different treatment strategies). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of yersinia enterocolitica and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the recommended management of yersinia enterocolitica.
- Outline the typical presentation (acute yersiniosis and pseudoappendicitis) for a patient with yersinia enterocolitica.
- Review the pathophysiology of yersinia enterocolitica.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with yersinia enterocolitica.
