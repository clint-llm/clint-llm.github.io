An azygos lobe is not a true accessory lobe as it does not have a unique bronchus or blood supply. There are few reports describing bronchial and vascular supply. One report of an autopsy of a 43-year-old man found that the azygos lobe was supplied by apical sub-subsegmental branches of B1b (B1bi) and B1a (B1ai), and this was accompanied by the pulmonary artery of the same sub-subsegments, A1bi and A1ai. The lateral sub-subsegmental branches of B1aii and B1bii accompanied by the pulmonary artery did not supply the azygos lobe. Venous supply was from V1a and V2 but not V1b ****Another report described similar findings with the azygos lobe ventilated by the posterior branch of the apical segmental bronchus, B1a, and accompanied by two apical sub-segmental arteries, A1ai and A1aii, and the apical inter subsegmental vein, V1a

The lymphatic supply to an azygos lobe does not differ from that of a normal lung. Lymphatic vessels of the respiratory bronchioles merge and follow the bronchiole tree to the hilum.
