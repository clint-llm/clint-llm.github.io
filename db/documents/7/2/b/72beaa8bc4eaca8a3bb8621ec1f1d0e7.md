Patients with interstitial lung disease typically present with exertional dyspnea and nonproductive cough. Extrapulmonary symptoms such as arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, or malaise may also be present and suggest an underlying collagen vascular disease. Family history may suggest a particular diagnosis, as someÂ collagen vascular diseases have a genetic basis. Smoking, drug use, employment history, and occupational exposure are important to ascertain.

Pulmonary auscultation may reveal rales or crackles. Skin findings may include skin thickening and telangiectasias (systemic sclerosis), Raynaud's phenomenon (systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus), discoid, or butterfly rash (systemic lupus erythematosus), heliotrope rash (polymyositis and dermatomyositis), and Gottron papules (polymyositis and dermatomyositis). Xerostomia, xerophthalmia, and parotid swelling may be seen in patients with Sjogren's syndrome.
