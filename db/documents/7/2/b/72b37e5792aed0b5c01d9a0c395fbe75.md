The complications that are commonly seen in the neonatal period include fulminant sepsis, respiratory failure, ectropion, eclabium, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), electrolyte imbalances, contractures, constricting skin bands leading to limb and or digital ischemic necrosis. Rajpopat et al. reported recurrent skin infections in early childhood and plantar changes leading to delay in walking due to palmoplantar keratoderma. Both heat and cold intolerance have been reported. Pruritis affected almost half of the survivors.

Generalized poor hair growth and nail deformities were commonly reported. Ophthalmologic problems included persistent ectropion, recurrent conjunctivitis, and keratitis. Difficulty maintaining weight despite high-caloric diets has been reported. Developmental delays in reaching age-appropriate developmental milestones were common. Height and weight were below average. The abnormal keratotic epithelium at birth transitions to severe ichthyosiform erythroderma in 4 to 6 weeks. Children with HI require long-term interprofessional care.
