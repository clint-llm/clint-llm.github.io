Bronchiolitis is a common presentation to clinicians and adds significantly to the cost of healthcare. To lower morbidity, the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis are best done with an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, pediatrician, primary caregiver, and infectious disease consultant. The diagnosis is clinical, and in most cases, the treatment is supportive.

While most children benefit from hydration, some may require antipyretics and a cool-mist humidifier. About 1%-3% of children with severe bronchiolitis may require admission for more aggressive respiratory support.

The key is the education of the caregiver. Clinicians, including the pharmacist and nurse practitioner, should educate the caregiver with regards to:

- The positioning of the infant

- Temperature control in the home

- Importance of oral hydration

- Avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke and other irritants

- Handwashing

- Compliance with medications

When the infant is ill, the caregiver should be educated about when to bring him or her to the hospital or clinician and not seek alternative care remedies. Follow-up of the infant is necessary to ensure that improvement is taking place. Only through open communication with the interprofessional team can the outcomes be improved and complications reduced.
