Patients and families should be educated about the presence and features of acquired language impairment. In otherwise cognitively intact patients, isolated language impairment can often be mistaken for global cognitive impairment. Patients should be provided with communication strategies individualized to their impairment. Even in the presence of reading language deficits, it can be helpful to periodically provide written educational material to patients with language impairment.
