When considering where to make the initial incision, it is important to consider skin tension and understand that the greatest tension exists along the relaxed skin tension lines, and the least tension exists along the lines of maximum extensibility. Keeping this in mind, incisions should be placed parallel to the relaxed skin tension lines to minimize tension.

Generally, axial flaps are typically raised from the trunk, neck, or proximal limbs in areas where there is sufficient loose skin to facilitate the donor site's closure with minimal morbidity. There are a variety of different axial flaps which can be raised; however, the basic operative technique is as follows:

- Measure the dimensions of the defect

- Design a skin paddle which is centered over the axial course of the vascular pedicle, taking care to ensure that the plan of dissection includes the fasciocutaneous vessel within the subcutaneous fat

- It is useful to leave a cuff of fascia and subcutaneous fat around the pedicle to avoid injuring. It is unnecessary to visualize the pedicle, but if there is evidence of arterial insufficiency in the flap, you may need to skeletonize the vessels.

- Transfer the flap into the defect

- Inset the flap into the defect

- Close the donor site either primarily or with skin grafts depending on the size of the defect
