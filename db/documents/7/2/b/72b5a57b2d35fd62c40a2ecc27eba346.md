Thyroidectomy is the mainstay of nontoxic goiter that is causing symptoms or complications. It is always tolerated by most patients including those with limited functional reserve. It must include total or near-total gland excision. It has the advantage that the recurrence rate is quietly low. However, many complications may occur during or after thyroidectomy including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism. Also, the patients who undergo total thyroidectomy need long-life thyroid supplements.
