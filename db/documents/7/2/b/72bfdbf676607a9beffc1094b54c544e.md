The skills involved in post-mastectomy reconstruction with postoperative adjustable implants require specific technique and expertise, which takes time to develop. The strategy depends on the approach, whether concomitant mastectomy reconstruction versus delayed reconstruction is decided upon. It is important to educate the nursing staff to monitor flap integrity postoperatively. In the preoperative preparation for any of the reconstructions, it is very crucial to educate the patient on smoking cessation. Postoperatively, patient education on drain care, diabetes control as well as shoulder range of motion exercises play an important role in the recovery stage.
