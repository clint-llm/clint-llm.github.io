Critical care is a complex and dynamic endeavor for cardiac surgical patients. Successful outcomes after cardiac surgery depend on optimal postoperative care. Balanced fluid resuscitation, adequate inotropic support, attention to rewarming, preventive measures for deep venous thrombosis and bedsores, and ventilator management are vital components.

Patients undergoing cardiac surgery suffer from adverse pathophysiological and psychological consequences of cardiac events, making them the prime candidates for cardiac rehabilitation. An individualized program formulation for an appropriate medical, rehabilitative, and surgical strategy to prevent the recurrence of cardiac events is the primary goal of such a program. It should curtail the pathophysiological and psychological effects of heart disease. It should limit the risk of reinfarction or sudden death. It should aim at relieving cardiac symptoms and reverse atherosclerosis by instituting programs for exercise training, education, counseling, and risk factor alteration. It should reintegrate heart disease patients into successful functional status in their families and society.
