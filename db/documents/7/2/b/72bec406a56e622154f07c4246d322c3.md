The primary function of the peroneal tendons is to evert and plantarflex at the ankle. Also, the peroneus longus will plantarflex the first ray leading to hindfoot varus during walking. Having pre-existing varus hindfoot alignment can increase strain on the peroneus longus tendon that can lead to inflammation, subluxation, and possible tears.

Peroneal Tendonitis

- Lateral ankle instability can cause laxity, leading to the increased motion of the tendons around the fibula with stretched superior peroneal retinaculum

- Low lying peroneus brevis muscle belly having to go through the narrow tendon sheath

Peroneal Subluxation/Dislocation

- Instability can be acute from the rupture of the superior retinaculum or fibular groove avulsion or chronic. Chronic subluxation is associated with fibular groove flattening laxity of the superior retinacular ligament

Peroneal tendon tear

- Musculotendinous junction during forceful contraction or in the cuboid tunnel

- Most tears are longitudinal and result from chronic subluxation over the distal fibula
