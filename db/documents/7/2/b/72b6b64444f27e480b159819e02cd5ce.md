Informed consent should be taken before the procedure. The procedure can be office-based with all aseptic protocols, but a longer procedure may require an operation theatre setting.

Standard aseptic protocols are to be followed, including hand disinfection, sterile gloves, using a sterile eyelid speculum, and topical microbicidal solution in the eye.

The instruments vary depending on the type of intravitreal implantation; sterile drape, drape scissors, eyelid speculum, calipers, toothed forceps, sterile cotton buds, sterile syringes and needles, sclerotomy cannulas with infusion cannula, blade for scleral incision and suture materials may be required.
