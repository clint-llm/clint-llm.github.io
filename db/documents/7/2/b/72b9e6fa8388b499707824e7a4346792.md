According to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, Enterobacter spp. was responsible for approximately five to seven percent of hospital-acquired bacteremias in the United States from 1976-1989. Among isolates in the ICU, it was found that Enterobacter was the third most common pathogen in the respiratory tract, the fourth most common pathogen in surgical wounds, and the fifth most common pathogen in the urinary tract and the bloodstream.

The Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiologic Importance (SCOPE) project analyzed approximately 24,179 cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections in United States Hospitals from 1995-2002. Among monomicrobial bloodstream infections, Enterobacter was found in 4.7% of infections in the ICU but only in 3.1% of infections in non-ICU wards. Enterobacter spp was the fifth most common pathogen isolated in the ICU, and the eighth-most common pathogen isolated in non-ICU wards.
