Management of cough may require teamwork by different specialties.

- New onset of a chronic cough without obvious etiology should prompt a referral to a pulmonologist or cough specialist.

- If poor cardiac function is suspected, then a referral to a cardiologist is recommended for the evaluation of congestive heart failure.

- If a gastrointestinal aberration is suspected, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, referral to a gastroenterologist is warranted.
