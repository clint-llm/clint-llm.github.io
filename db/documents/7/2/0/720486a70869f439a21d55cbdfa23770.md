Management of herniation syndromes depends on etiology, but the prime intention focuses on supporting the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular systems while attempting to decrease the intracranial pressure. Patients presenting with evidence of herniation are treated using a tiered emergency neurological life support (ENLS) management protocol.

**Medical Management**

- The head of the bed should be elevated to more than 30 degrees

- Corticosteroid therapy only for tumors

- Hyperosmolar therapy with hypertonic saline or mannitol - Hypertonic saline is available in concentrations from 2 to 23.4% and can be administered as a bolus with set serum sodium goals; serum sodium level is checked every 4 to 6 hours. Mannitol is administered as a 0.5 to 1 g/kg intravenous bolus and may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours with concurrent monitoring of the serum osmolality.

- Sedation with propofol

- Hypothermia

- Pentobarbital for electroencephalographic burst suppression

- Hyperventilation in the early acute phase before a definite treatment is performed

- Seizure prophylaxis

**Surgical Management**

- ICP monitoring

- External ventricular drain to measure ICP and to drain CSF

- Craniotomy to remove a hematoma or brain mass

- Decompressive craniectomy
