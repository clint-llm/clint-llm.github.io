The following conditions should be ruled out while making a diagnosis of somnambulism.

- Neurodegenerative changes seen in Parkinson disease at the brainstem level can cause arousals from NREM/REM sleep and affect locomotion and muscle tone, leading to several sleep-associated behavioral disorders, including somnambulism**.**

- Somnambulism due to medications such as antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, lithium, antipsychotics, SSRIs, quinine, beta-blockers, and TCAs has been observed.

- REM sleep behavior disorder

- Smith-Magenis syndrome: In addition to other findings, this syndrome presents with sleep disturbance characterized by changes in circadian rhythm with frequent awakenings at night and daytime sleepiness, which causes patients and families significant distress.
