Lynch syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team including oncology nurses. Besides the patient, it is important to monitor the carrier of the genes. Lynch syndrome carriers are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancers and extracolonic cancers including endometrial, gastric, ovarian, pancreas, ureter and renal pelvis, biliary tract, brain (usually glioblastoma as seen in Turcot syndrome), small intestinal cancers, and sebaceous gland adenomas, and keratoacanthoma (as seen in Muir-Torre syndrome). Screening for colorectal cancers has shown proven beneficial in detecting colorectal cancers and reducing mortality, while the value of screening for extracolonic cancers remains unclear. Ongoing research may better delineate risk and guidelines for screening, surveillance, and treatment of Lynch syndrome carriers.
