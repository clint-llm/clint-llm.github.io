Under a light microscope, the histological section shows the complete absence of endothelium and the Descemet membrane in the area of corneal opacity. The Bowman membrane may be thin or absent.Decorin, Keratan, and Lumican, which play essential roles in corneal development and transparency.

Lumican is responsible for the posterior stromal collagen fibril arrangement and diameter. On lumican immunolabelling in Peters anomaly patients, there is a significant decrease in lumican level in the posterior corneal stroma.

The deficiency of decorin proteoglycan leads to corneal scarring.
