Tracheostomy has been increasingly performed in children with complex medical conditions for the management of upper airway obstruction, prolonged ventilation, abnormal ventilatory drive, and irreversible neuromuscular conditions. This activity reviews the indication of pediatric tracheostomy, tracheostomy procedure techniques, and their complications in the pediatric population and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in taking care of children with a tracheostomy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for tracheostomy in children including the differences in anatomy and physiology between pediatric and adult airway.
- Summarize the equipment required in the operation theater, patient preparation, and technique for doing the pediatric tracheostomy.
- Outline the early as well as late complications associated with a pediatric tracheostomy.
- Review how well-coordinated interprofessional tracheostomy care can significantly reduce adverse events and improve the outcome in patients with tracheostomy.
