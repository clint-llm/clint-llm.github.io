The most common etiology of apraxia of eyelid opening is idiopathic focal dystonia. Other causes documented in the literature include:

- Blepharospasm or focal dystonia of the eyelids - idiopathic (also known as benign essential blepharospasm), infectious (keratitis, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, conjunctivitis), toxic exposure (extensive sunlight), autoimmune (keratoconjunctivitis sicca from Sjogren's disease), neurodegenerative (Parkinson's and Huntington's disease)

- Face or eyebrow ptosis - severe levator palpebrae dysfunction from abnormal development, vascular injury, neuromuscular disease (myasthenia gravis), neuroimmunological (multiple sclerosis), trauma, iatrogenic (eye surgery). Ptosis can easily be corrected by tightening the muscle's tendon that raises the eyelids.

- Dermatochalasis - refers to excess upper or lower eyelid skin, or both. This is merely baggy eyelids and can be fixed by removing the excess baggage and skin in the eyelids.

- Psychogenic- photophobia, fatigue
