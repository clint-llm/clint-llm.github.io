The maxilla and mandible bones create the opening of the mouth. The maxilla comprises the upper jaw while the lower jaw is from the mandible. These two bones work in sync for speaking, eating, and facial expression. The mandible is the only bone in the skull that is mobile. The mandible elevates and depresses during the actions of eating, speaking, and facial expression. The mandible bone has most of its vital structures enclosed in the mandibular foramen.

The words "mandibular foramen," equate to an opening/canal in the mandible bone. The foramen is designed to protect vessels and nerves as they travel toward their final destination. These vital structures are necessary for nerve innervation and blood supply to the skin, bone, teeth, gums, muscles, and tissues that attach to the mandible and the tissues bordering the mandible.
