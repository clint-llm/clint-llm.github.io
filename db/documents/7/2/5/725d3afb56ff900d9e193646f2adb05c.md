The laryngeal nerves may suffer damage during surgical procedures, especially with thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve during dissection produces vocal cord paralysis and results in reduced protection of the airway due to the lack of ability to medialize the vocal cords. With a unilateral injury, hoarseness would not be an unexpected finding. One rare but feared complication is a bilateral injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves, which would result in a lack of ability to close the airway with the true vocal folds, significantly increasing the risk of aspiration. Additionally, the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, in charge of innervating the cricothyroid muscle,Â  may be damaged during a cricothyrotomy or thyroidectomy and would lead to an inability to tense the vocal cords resulting in a decreased pitch of the voice.
