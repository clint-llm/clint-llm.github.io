The equipment required for pudendal nerve block consists of chlorhexidine or a povidone-iodine-based solution, disposable sterile drapes, sterile gloves, sterile gauze swabs, sterile syringes and needles, and a local anesthetic solution of choice. A 20 cm 20 gauge spinal needle is often used. Lidocaine 1% and bupivacaine 0.25% are the most commonly used solutions. For longer-term therapy, a combination of lidocaine, bupivacaine, and a steroid (such as triamcinolone) is sometimes used as this can provide 30 days or more of relief.

The block can be done without image guidance, but ultrasound or fluoroscopy are recommended options. Equipment for monitoring a patient’s hemodynamic status should also be available.
