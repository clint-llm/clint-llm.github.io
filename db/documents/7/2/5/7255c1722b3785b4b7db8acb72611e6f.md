The dosing and administration of tPA are specific to the indication.

**FDA Approved Indications**

Pulmonary Embolism

- 100 mg over 2 hours; may be administered as a 10 mg bolus followed by 90 mg over 2 hours

Ischemic Stroke: The only blood test that is necessary before tPA usage is the blood glucose level. If the patient is on anticoagulation like coumadin, then only we should do PT, PTT, and INR, etc. The benefit of tPA depends a lot on time. The sooner the patient receives tPA; the better are the outcomes.

- Maximum recommended dose is 90mg

- Patients less than or equal to 100 kg load with 0.09 mg/kg (10% of 0.9 mg/kg dose) as an IV bolus over 1 minute, followed by 0.81 mg/kg (90% of 0.9 mg/kg dose) as a continuous infusion over 60 minutes.

- Patients greater than100 kg load with 9 mg (10% of 90 mg) as an IV bolus over 1 minute, followed by 81 mg (90% of 90 mg) as a continuous infusion over 60 minutes.

STEMI

- Administer within 30 minutes of hospital arrival

- Adults greater than or equal to 67 kg get 100 mg total dosage administered as a 15 mg IV bolus, followed by 50 mg IV infused over 30 minutes, and then 35 mg IV infused over the next 60 minutes

- Adults less than 67 kg get 15 mg IV bolus, followed by 0.75 mg/kg IV (not to exceed 50 mg) infused over 30 minutes, and then 0.5 mg/kg IV (not to exceed 35 mg) over the next 60 minutes

IV Catheter Occlusion

- Instill 2 mg of alteplase in the occluded lumen and allow a 2-hour dwell time. This dose is repeatable one time if the first attempt is not successful, the use of greater than 4 mg of alteplase for this indication has not been a topic of research.

**Off-Label Indications**

Pediatric Pleural Effusions

- Four mg in 30 mL to 50 mL 0.9% intrapleural sodium chloride injection via chest tube and left to dwell for 1 hour as a single dose or as multiple doses 24 hours apart

Catheter-Directed Therapy

- 0.1 mg/kg/hr (maximum of 20 mg per 24 hours for up to 96 hours)

Prosthetic Valve Thrombosis

- Twenty-five mg intravenously over 25 hours repeated as needed until a total dose of 200 mg of alteplase administered or resolution is confirmable by TEE

Alteplase is administered intravenously as a bolus injection or infusion. In emergencies, it is reasonable to administer tPA through intraosseous access.
