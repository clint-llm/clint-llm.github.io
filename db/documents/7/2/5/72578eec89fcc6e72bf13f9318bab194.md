Potassium is an essential mineral constituent of the human body and is the chief cation found within the intracellular fluid of all cells. The chief indication for potassium administration is potassium deficiency or hypokalemia, a condition in which serum potassium level falls below a critical range. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for potassium administration as a valuable agent in managing hypokalemia and other disorders when applicable. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for interprofessional team members who are involved in the prescribing or administration of potassium to patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the proper indications for potassium administration.
- Review the signs of potassium overdose or toxicity.
- Summarize the proper dose and routes of administration of potassium in different age groups.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance potassium therapy, where indicated, and improve patient outcomes.
