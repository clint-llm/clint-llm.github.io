Filgrastim is a recombinant human methionyl granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF) which stimulates the proliferation, maturation of neutrophil progenitors, and functional end-cell activation. It also facilitates their release into the blood.

Filgrastim exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics with a short half-life of 3.5 hours, with filgrastim concentration and neutrophil count being the determinants of clearance.

The bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60 to 70%.
