Salicylate toxicity in children can be decreased by educating parents. While the management of the acute toxicity is usually done with an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, the nurse and the pharmacist play an important role in prevention. At the time of discharge, the parents must be told of the harm of all over the counter medications. Overuse of these medications should be avoided. Parents need to know thatÂ just because aspirin is readily available does not mean it is safe. At home, all medications should be stored away from the reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet. Parents should be told the signs and symptoms of aspirin toxicity and the need to bring the child into the emergency room as soon as possible. Finally, if the aspirin toxicity was intentional, the nurse should recommend that the patient see a mental health counselor prior to discharge.

**Outcomes**

Salicylate toxicity has a high morbidity and mortality. At least 1-2% of patients die from this agent. Data from the poison control centers reveal that at least 1/4 of the medication-related deaths are related to aspirin alone or in combination with other medications. The important fact is that salicylate toxicity can be treated if the diagnosis and treatment are done promptly. For the survivors, some residual neurological deficit may persist for a few years.
