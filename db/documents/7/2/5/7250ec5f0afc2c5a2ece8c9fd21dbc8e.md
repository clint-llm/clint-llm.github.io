WBAs are tools used for both formative and summative assessment of trainee performance. Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) brought WBAs into practice in 2007, intending to shift training towards a competency-based model. Formative assessments allow learning through feedback and highlight areas of development, whereas summative assessments determine competence using measurable terms.

Simulation should be incorporated into the early stages of training, such as at the Core Surgical Trainee (CST) level, to evaluate surgical competency and allow more challenging procedural skills development in the OR. Assessment of competence may be achieved through the use of global rating scales or task-specific checklists; the former may be a more reliable method of evaluation; however, the latter may be more appropriate for novices for formative training.
