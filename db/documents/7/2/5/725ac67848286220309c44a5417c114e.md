While some wounds are simple, the majority of encountered wounds are caused by or become complicated by confounding patient-related issues.

**Examples**

- A chronic wound will have a different structure and percentage of components than an acute wound, requiring conversion for healing.

- An underlying infection will impede wound healing even if the infection is subacute.

- Damaged or constricted arterial supply will prevent appropriate blood flow to the wound.

- Impaired venous drainage may cause venous stasis.

- Physical pressure on chronic ulceration will cause repeated damage, preventing healing.

**Universal Principles of Management**

- Thorough evaluation

- Obtain source control

- Eliminate confounding/contributing factors

- Optimize the wound’s healing ability/environment

- Close the wound

Considering this rational algorithm, in total, is the core of successful wound healing. Similarly, there is no one-to-one correlation between a given wound and specific treatment. A spectrum of options must be considered for every wound encountered; selecting the best option for each patient remains challenging.
