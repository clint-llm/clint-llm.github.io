The male to female ratio is 2:1. A private study of 1084 individuals with traumatic brain injuries revealed that TBI was a high-risk factor not only for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also for other psychiatric disorders. Statistically, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that annually, about 1.5 million Americans survive a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Among these, approximately 230,000 are hospitalized. In 2000, there were 10,958 TBI diagnoses. In 2015, this number jumped to 344,030. Mortality across all TBI severities is approximately 3%, yet morbidity is more difficult to estimate.
