Healthcare providers must make sure that patients are in good health, including but not limited to the presenting complaint. One article focuses on the importance of interprofessional team approach and the associated 6 C’s standing for care, communication, courage, compassion, commitment, and competence.

It shows that a collaborative model for critical care in acute respiratory failure patients will prove useful in improving recovery. For example, in subglottic stenosis, an interprofessional team should involve an otolaryngologist, an intensivist, an anesthesiologist, and a pulmonologist to optimize patient care. [Level 1]
