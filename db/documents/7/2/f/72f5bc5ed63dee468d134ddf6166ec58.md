Best patient outcomes are achieved through the combined efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. After receiving a bypass operation, patients are followed by this interprofessional team that includes physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, residents, fellows, primary care providers, pharmacists, internists, and surgeons. Before discharge, patients typically receive some form of rehabilitation necessitating the assistance of physical and occupational therapists. Once discharged, at-home nurses may continue meeting with patients to monitor and ensure their recovery.****

The vascular surgeon is the primary "driver" in these cases, but the patient's primary care clinician will also be instrumental in post-procedural monitoring. Nurses in all clinics will help coordinate patient care and follow-up and serve as liaisons between the various specialists. Pharmacists will review medication regimens to ensure appropriate dosing and no drug interactions and can counsel the patient about their drugs. Open communication between all team members, along with accurate record-keeping, will enable the interprofessional paradigm to guide optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
