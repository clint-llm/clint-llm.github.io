PCA can be an effective way to control acute, chronic, postoperative, and labor pain. However, it requires a competent interprofessional healthcare team consisting of a physician, pharmacist, nurse, and patient. It is essential to educate healthcare team members about the variety of routes, medications, dosing regimens, complications, pre-procedure, and post-procedure assessments, side effects, and expected outcomes involved. The pharmacist should double-check the dose and ensure that the delivery rate is safe. The nurses should double-check the order and ensure that the correct amount of drug is delivered. The team can inspect the records kept by the device and see if dosing has been optimal for patient pain control. While PCA can reduce the direct involvement of a physician and nurse in pain control, a supervisory role is still necessary to monitor the proper function and effectiveness of the PCA treatment along with the avoidance of undesired outcomes. The entire interprofessional team must communicate with each other to achieve optimal pain control results and avoid poor outcomes. [Level 5]
