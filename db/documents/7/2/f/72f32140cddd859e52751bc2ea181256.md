**ACC/AHA Heart Failure Stages**

- Stage A: Patients at high risk for HF but have no symptoms or structural heart disease

- Stage B: Patients have structural heart disease but are asymptomatic

- Stage C: Patients have structural heart disease plus symptoms

- Stage D: Patients have refractory HF that requires modified interventions

**Management Recommendations by ACC/AHA According to HF Stages**

- Stage A: Reduction of risk factors and aggressive treatment of comorbidities

- Stage B: Aggressive risk factor reduction and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) and/or beta-blocker.

- Stage C: Combination goal-directed therapy with ACEI/ARBs or angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), beta-blockers, and loop diuretics for fluid retention. The most recent AHA/ACC update from 2017 added a class IIa recommendation for ivabradine in patients with stage C HF.

- Stage D: Goal-directed medical therapies indicated for stage C and consideration for heart transplantation. In patients with advanced disease and decreased life expectancy, palliative care discussions and advance directive planning should be considered.
