Todd paresis is a syndrome associated with weakness or paralysis of part or all of the body as soon as the ictal discharge (seizure) has ended. It most commonly affects one limb or one half of the body but can have a wide range of presentations.

This condition was initially described by Irish physiologist and physician Robert Bentley Todd in 1849 but has been further defined, researched, and explained by many others over the years.
