Given the multi-organ system manifestations, many potential complications abound. The most important to keep in mind, however, are the ones which clinicians can significantly impact the course and improve the outcome.

- In severe cases, the complications of pulmonary hypoplasia and renal dysplasia predominate. These require management by the multidisciplinary team, including the maternal-fetal medicine specialists, neonatologists, urologists, nephrologists, geneticists, pulmonologists, anesthesiologists, respiratory therapists, and others. Families should be thoroughly informed about the condition of the fetus (or infant), and receive counseling about the possible outcome. They should be helped to make informed decisions, and all the ethical considerations should be addressed by the team of experienced specialists.

- Beyond the neonatal period, urinary tract complications predominate, and about one-third of patients may eventually progress to need a renal transplant.
