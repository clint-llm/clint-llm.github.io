Patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction will present with gradually worsening abdominal distension and some degree of abdominal discomfort. Nausea and vomiting will usually be present to some degree. Although bowel obstruction is classically taught to be associated with constipation and obstipation, a significant number of patients with ACPO will continue to have some degree of bowel function, and diarrhea is possible due to the hypersecretion of water. It is important to remember that the majority of these patients will have severe underlying co-morbidities or concurrent exacerbations of chronic disease, which may make the history unreliable.

The examination will invariably show some degree of abdominal distention. The abdomen will be tympanic, and auscultation should reveal the presence of bowel sounds classically high-pitched. Some degree of abdominal tenderness is expected on the exam. Fever and any severe abdominal tenderness with or without signs of peritonitis are ominous findings suggestive of ischemia and perforation. Signs of peritonitis with abnormal vital signs should be concerning for sepsis.
