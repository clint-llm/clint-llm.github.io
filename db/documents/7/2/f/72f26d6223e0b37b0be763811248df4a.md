Diagnostic paracentesis should be performed, and fluid amylase and protein measurements should be measured along with cell count, culture, gram stain, and cytology. Pancreatic ascites is characterized by an amylase level over 1000 IU/L and protein level greater than 3 g/dL. The calculated serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is normally less than 1.1 g/dL. This distinguishes from ascites secondary to portal hypertension where amylase levels of ascitic fluid are not elevated, and fluid albumin levels are normally below 1.5 g/dL with a SAAG greater than 1.1 g/dL.

In patients where pancreatic ascites is suspected based on clinical features and peritoneal fluid assessment discussed above, further diagnostic workup includes endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and secretin augmented magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to determine the presence and site of the pancreatic duct leak. Use of ERCP for diagnosis also allows for intervention at the time of diagnosis as described below.
