**Fluid Resuscitation**

Proper fluid resuscitation is recommended for burns involving >15% TBSA to prevent complications associated with the burn shock phase.  A lack of early and aggressive fluid resuscitation in severe burns (>15% TBSA) will result in hypovolemic shock. The intravascular volume becomes depleted due to fluid shifts and increased capillary permeability. Delaying fluid resuscitation for more than 2 hours after the initial severe burn is associated with an appreciable increase in mortality.  Of note, when calculating TBSA, only second and third-degree burns are factored into the calculation of TBSA; first-degree burns are excluded from TBSA estimation. Intravascular volume repletion helps mitigate the resultant hypovolemia complications such as tissue hypoperfusion and the associated reflexive vasoconstriction.  Burns less than 15% BSA can be appropriately managed with oral fluids or a maintenance intravenous fluid rate of 1.5 times normal.

The accepted crystalloid for fluid resuscitation is lactated Ringer's due to the worsening of metabolic acidosis associated with a large volume of normal saline (0.9%) infusions required for severe burns. Patients with severe burns are already predisposed to metabolic acidosis due to decreased kidney perfusion during burn shock. Although several formulas exist for calculating the recommended amount of volume needed for fluid resuscitation, the clinician should not lose focus of the clinical markers of appropriate resuscitation and taper fluid resuscitation to feedback from objective findings such as:

- Urine output goal: 0.5 to 0.1ml/kg/hr

- Fractional excretion of sodium: <1% (suggests hypovolemia)

- BUN to Creatinine ratio: >20 (suggests hypovolemia)

- Echocardiogram: assessment of stroke volume and ejection fraction

- Arterial Blood Gas: Base deficit <5 suggests hypoperfusion in the absence of carbon monoxide poisoning

When clinicians lose focus on the physiologic parameters (particularly urine output) of adequate fluid resuscitation, the phenomenon of "fluid creep" occurs. Fluid creep can be described as excessive volume administration to burn patients past what is appropriate resuscitation for their clinical condition. Fluid creep can result in excessive tissue and pulmonary edema, further complicating the clinical picture. Pulmonary edema can result in worsening respiratory status leading to tracheal intubation or pneumonia.  Airway edema can be worsened by fluid creep, producing a clinical scenario requiring intubation. Typically, fluid creep occurs due to a miscalculation of fluid resuscitation volumes in the first 24 hours after an initial burn. Clinicians may fail to consider the multiple intravenous medications a patient may be receiving (i.e., antibiotics, analgesics, sedatives, etc.), which should be included when considering fluid resuscitation. The most important objective finding to taper fluid replacement is urine output which, when not considered, can also result in fluid creep.  The role of colloids has not yet been defined but could be considered an adjunct therapy to prevent hypervolemia.

The most common formula for estimating the amount of fluid resuscitation needed for a patient is the Parkland formula. The Parkland formula estimates the amount of fluid to be administered over the first 24 hours, with half of the calculated volume recommended to be administered over the first eight hours. The percentage of the burn's body surface area (BSA) is expressed as a whole number.

Parkland Formula: 4mL x kg x Percentage of burn BSA

Example: A 75kg male has a burn comprising 30% TBSA

- Calculate the total amount of Lactated Ringer's to give in the first 24 hours

- 4mL x 75kg x 30 = 9,000 mL for the first 24 hours

- Calculate the amount of fluid to give in the first 8 hours

- Half of the total volume should be administered in the first 24 hours
- 9.000mL/2 = 4,500 of Lactated Ringer's in the first 8 hours

- Administer the remaining amount of fluid in the last 16 hours

- 4,500mL in the last 16 hours

**Estimation of TBSA**

The Wallace Rule of Nines is a common method to estimate the TBSA of the burn.  The Rule of Nines is valued for its simplicity and practicality in clinical scenarios.  For smaller burns, clinical providers may use the Rule of Palms, which involves estimating the size of a burn by using the patient's palm to indicate 1% of TBSA. When calculating TBSA for fluid resuscitation or clinical diagnosis criteria, first-degree burns are generally not included (just second and third-degree burns). Despite these tools, enormous amounts of variability in body surface area due to gender, age, and body mass index can make it difficult to provide a standardized method for estimating TBSA. Those with a larger body mass index often have an overestimated calculation of their burn TBSA.

Advances in technology may allow for 3D body scanning to more accurately determine the TBSA of burns. Accurate estimation of TBSA is important for transfer to appropriate burn centers and to help dictate fluid resuscitation goals. The anesthesiologist needs to have open communication with other health care professionals when accepting the care of a severely burned patient in the operating room to better understand the fluid goals of the patient in the perioperative period. With the prevalence of miscalculations and the ill consequences of fluid creep, the astute anesthesiologist should be able to estimate TBSA of a burn upon initial assessment to administer fluids accurately.

**Neuromuscular Blockade**

A major concern with burn patients is the upregulation of acetylcholine receptors subsequent to a burn resulting in life-threatening hyperkalemia after using succinylcholine. In healthy patients, succinylcholine use is associated with only 0.5 mEq/L, but in the burn patient, this response is exaggerated. The increased susceptibility to hyperkalemia is likely associated with changes in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Recent evidence suggests that burn patients have upregulated alpha7 and gamma subunit genes producing not only more acetylcholine receptors spread throughout the body but also slightly altered receptors. These altered receptors likely have abnormal electrophysiological interactions with succinylcholine producing greater hyperkalemia.

This upregulation of acetylcholine receptors does not happen fast enough for significant hyperkalemia to develop until approximately 24 to 48 hours after the initial burn injury.  Resistance to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade happens much faster than the sensitivity to succinylcholine (within the 24-48 hour window). Thus, the presenting burn patient may require higher than usual doses of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade than expected. Resistance to the neuromuscular blockade produced by rocuronium can be partially overcome through an increased dose. Rocuronium can provide reasonably good intubating conditions with a dose of 1.2mg/kg after a significant burn injury.
