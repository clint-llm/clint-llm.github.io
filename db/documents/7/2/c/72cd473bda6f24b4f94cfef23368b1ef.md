The potential differential diagnosis for endometrial hyperplasia are conditions which can result in focal or generalized thickening  of the endometrium:

- Endometrial cancer: Histopathological examination of the endometrial tissue can show markers of invasions in endometrial cancer.

- Endometrial polyp: Hydrosonography can be helpful in diagnosing endometrial polyp by enhancing visualization.  Diagnostic hysteroscopy can confirm the presence of a polyp.

- Endometritis: Irregular endometrium and focal thickness are the hallmarks of endometritis.
