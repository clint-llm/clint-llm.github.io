In patients with refractory ADHF, which is severe in nature, who do not respond to standard pharmacological treatment, including the use of IV diuretics due to mechanisms discussed above, volume overload can be reversed through the use of UF. UF has been shown to produce an overall positive nitrogen balance andÂ may also be indicated in patients with fluid overload that need to increase their caloric intake. In patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass with evidence of excess body water, UF may be used to prevent the additional accumulation of fluid.
