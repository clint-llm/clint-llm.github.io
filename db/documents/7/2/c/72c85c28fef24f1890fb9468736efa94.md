Symptoms of overdose with topical tretinoin use may include excessive redness, peeling, and discomfort.

Symptoms of overdose with oral tretinoin include the following: cracked and sore lips, redness, headache, flushing, stomach pain, dizziness, loss of coordination.

Case Report: 39-year-old overdosed on 1000 mg of ingested tretinoin in a suicide attempt and developed nothing besides some non-bloody diarrhea, which received treatment with hydration and activated charcoal.

Regarding isotretinoin use for acne treatment, triglyceride concentrations that rise to mild to moderate concentrations (300 to 500 mg/dL) do not necessitate a change in dose but instead are manageable with lifestyle modification. If the triglyceride concentrations rise severely (500 and 800 mg/dL), dose reduction of isotretinoin may be warranted with the addition of a lipid-lowering agent. If severe hypertriglyceridemia occurs (>800 mg/dL), cessation may be necessary due to the risk of acute pancreatitis.

If liver enzymes increase to more than three times over baseline, the recommendation is to discontinue isotretinoin.

If necessary, tretinoin can be stopped abruptly without tapering.
