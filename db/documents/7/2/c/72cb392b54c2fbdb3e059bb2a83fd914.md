The most common mechanism of injury of a Chance fracture is a rapid deceleration in a motor vehicle collision. In this scenario, the patient’s spine forcibly flexes over the lap seatbelt, which serves as a fulcrum. Patients typically present with back pain without neurological deficits. Neurological deficits, such as weakness, numbness, and incontinence, can occur if there is a contusion of the spinal cord or cauda equina due to retropulsion of fracture fragments of the posterior vertebral body cortex.

A significant physical exam finding to assess for is the “seatbelt sign,” which refers to bruising or abrasion on the abdomen in the distribution of a seat belt. This finding is associated with Chance fractures and intra-abdominal injuries. The “seat belt sign” can also be detected on computed tomography as stranding in the subcutaneous fat of the anterior abdominal wall.

Because of the potential for bowel and bladder rupture, it is highly recommended that a surgeon examine all trauma patients with abdominal pain. In addition, a thorough neurological exam is necessary. Both the bladder and rectum should be examined.
