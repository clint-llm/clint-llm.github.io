Patients receiving intravenous therapy should be monitored for a Jarisch– Herxheimer reaction (JHR). A patient with JHR usually presents with fever with sweating, headache, malaise, and an exacerbation of the pre-existing signs and symptoms of syphilis like worsening of rashes or ocular inflammation. It is believed to be a hypersensitivity response due to the release of inflammatory cytokines from the dying organisms. JHR typically peaks in about 8 hours after receiving the first dose of antimicrobial therapy and gradually resolves over 24 hours. Prophylaxis with systemic steroids can prevent the response in some cases.
