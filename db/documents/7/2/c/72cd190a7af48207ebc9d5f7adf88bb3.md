Cicatricial pemphigoid is a chronic, progressive disease that results in scarring. Patients require long-term follow-up to monitor for complications as a result of scarring and possible relapse. Due to the potentially serious complications that can arise with cicatricial pemphigoid, it is recommended that therapy is initiated early and aggressively. Patients benefit from a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Although some patients benefit from immunosuppressive treatment and even have long-term remission, some patients have a refractory disease without a response of disease activity or only temporary control of disease activity with a given treatment.
