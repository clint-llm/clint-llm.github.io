The patient with cervical cancer is usually asymptomatic in the early stages. The history and physical involve a thorough sexual history including first age of intercourse, postcoital bleeding, and if there is pain during intercourse. Other pertinent information to gather includes previous sexually transmitted infections, the number of lifetime partners, previous history of HPV infection, history of human immunodeficiency virus, use of tobacco, and whether the patient has had a previous vaccination against HPV. The interview should also include menstrual patterns and any abnormal bleeding, persistent vaginal discharges, irritations, or known cervical lesions. The physical exam must include a full evaluation of the external and internal genitalia. In women with cervical cancer, the exam findings might include a friable cervix, lesions, erosions, or bleeding with examination and fixed adnexa.
