Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is an available renal replacement method that includes intermittent hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. It is intended to be applied for 24 hours or longer through continuous, slower dialysis. CRRT is performed through pump-driven venovenous extracorporeal circuits and acts as renal support through blood purification to allow solute and fluid homeostasis.

It requires appropriate vascular access, pumps to allow blood circulation, a permeable membrane, and varying solutions to allow fluid balance.
