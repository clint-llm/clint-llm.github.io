There are several issues of concern regarding the use of the McNemar test and the Mann-Whitney U test, explained as follows:

1. McNemar test compares paired categorical data. However, it can not be used to measure an agreement because the McNemar test compares the overall proportion. For example, if a researcher is comparing the test results of subjects examined by two different persons, and the proportion of subjects who pass the test between these populations are the same, this cannot be concluded as evidence of an agreement.

2. Mann-Whitney U test is a common test for comparing the median between two non normally distributed groups. However, researchers often forget the assumption that the data is derived from independent random samples from two distinct populations but with the same shape (distribution). Thus, when conducting this test, aside from reporting the p-value, the spread, and the shape of the data should be described, as it may relate to clinically significant and relevant findings.U test should be used.
