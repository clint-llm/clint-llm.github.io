A dysplastic nevus is a transition between benign moles and melanoma and is characterized by junctional melanocytic skin lesions showing dysplastic or abnormal change morphologically. It is a debatable condition since it has a significant incidence of turning into melanoma. To avoid the high mortality rate associated with melanoma, dysplastic nevi as a predisposing factor for melanoma should be promptly noticed and diagnosed. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of dysplastic nevi and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of atypical moles.
- Outline the physical findings associated with atypical moles.
- Outline the management options available for patients presenting with atypical moles.
- Identify the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by atypical moles.
