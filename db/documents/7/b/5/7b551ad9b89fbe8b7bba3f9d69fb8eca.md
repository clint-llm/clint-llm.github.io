# Continuing Education Activity

Spondylolysis refers to a posterior defect in the vertebral body at the pars interarticularis. Usually, this defect is due to trauma or from a chronic repetitive loading and hyperextension. If this instability results in translation of the vertebral body, spondylolisthesis has occurred. This process requires a fracture or deformation of the posterior spine elements creating an elongation of the pars. This condition occurs in all ages with the underlying cause varying based on the age group. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of lumbar spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different types of spondylolisthesis, differentiating the patholological features that distinguish each variety.
- Outline the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with lumbar spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Describe management strategies for spondylolisthesis, based on which variant of the condition with which the patient presents.
- Review the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with lumbar spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis.

# Introduction

Spondylolysis refers to a posterior defect of the vertebral body occurring at the pars interarticularis.

# Etiology

Isthmic spondylolisthesis refers to a defect within the pars interarticularis usually from repetitive microtrauma and accounts for the vast majority of cases in children and adolescents.

Degenerative spondylolisthesis is the most common form of spondylolisthesis seen in adults.

Acutely, a traumatic spondylolisthesis can occur following a high-energy injury flexion/extension that causes a fracture-dislocation at the posterior elements.

Another type is dysplastic spondylolisthesis which is a result of an abnormal formation of the posterior elements resulting in this subsequent instability.

# Epidemiology

The rates of spondylosis and spondylolisthesis vary widely by age group. In the pediatric population, spondylosis is present in about 5% of the population, most commonly (90%) at the L5 to S1 motion segment, although pathology at L4 is more likely to be symptomatic.

# Pathophysiology

Repetitive micro-traumas from hyperextension lead to elongated or absent pars interarticularis. This force applies additional stress to the facet joints and subsequent hypermobility leading to advanced degeneration of the disc space.

# History and Physical

Initial evaluation of lower back pain initiates by obtaining a history from the patient. This history should pertain to the timeline of pain, radiation of pain, and inciting events. The clinician should pay careful attention to prior episodes of trauma. Low-grade slips and stenotic spinal canals may decompress and relieve pain with leaning forward or sitting. It is crucial to note patient comments such as decreased pain with pushing a grocery cart or walking upstairs as both common actions have the spinal column in forwarding flexion.

Classically patients may complain of pain radiating down both buttocks and lower extremities. An evaluation of the patient's walking is also critical to better assess the daily impact that pain or neurological deficits cause. All physical examinations will include assessing the neurologic function of the arms, legs, bladder, and bowels. The keys to a thorough exam are organization and patience. One should evaluate not only strength but also sensation and reflexes. It is also essential to inspect the skin along the back and document the presence of tenderness to compression or palpable step-off.

Performing a straight leg test in a patient positioned supine may also reveal a stenotic canal.

Documentation is paramount as these initial findings will likely serve as a baseline for all future evaluations.

# Evaluation

Evaluation of patients with low-back pain typically includes anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the impacted area. Some physicians will obtain radiographs of the entire spine. A key component to radiographic evaluation is obtaining flexion/extension films, which illustrates vertebral segment stability.

One of the crucial measurements to note regarding slips is the amount of translation between vertebral bodies. The amount of “uncovering” of one endplate from the other determines the grade. There are four grades of spondylolisthesis: Grade 1: 0% to 25%, Grade 2: 26% to 50%, Grade 3: 51% to 75% and Grade 4: 76% to 99%.

An MRI is critical when evaluating patients with suspected spondylosis and spondylolisthesis. Frequently these patients will initially trail a six-week course of physical therapy. Upon follow-up, if the symptomology is still present, the clinician can obtain an MRI at that time.

# Treatment / Management

Non-surgical intervention includes modification of the activity that may have exacerbated the pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), physical therapy, stretching, and occasionally using a lumbosacral orthosis. A 2009 meta-analysis evaluating spondylolysis and grade 1 spondylolisthesis showed almost 84% of adolescent patients treated nonoperatively had a successful clinical outcome at one year.

While most patients improve with nonoperative treatment alone, those failing a conservative treatment course have three options- continued pain, complete avoidance of activities that elicit pain, or surgical intervention. Again, the surgical options for spondylolysis (as well as low-grade spondylolisthesis) should be reserved for those with either neurologic deficits, the progression of a slip, or pain limiting daily functions.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Lumbosacral disc injuries

- Lumbosacral discogenic pain syndrome

- Lumbosacral facet syndrome

- Lumbosacral spine acute bony injuries

- Lumbosacral spine sprain/strain injuries

- Lumbosacral spondylolisthesis

- Lumbosacral spondylosis

- Myofascial pain in athletes

- Sacroiliac joint injury

# Prognosis

The prognosis for patients with spondylolisthesis is generally good. Most patients will respond to conservative treatment. For those with ongoing, severe symptoms not relieved by conservative approaches, surgery can potentially relieve radicular leg symptoms by decompressing nerve roots. Localized lumbar pain may require lumbar fusion in more extreme cases.

# Complications

Complications of spondylolisthesis tend to be neurological. These can include chronic pain in the lower back or legs, and numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower extremities. Severe nerve compression can lead to problems with bowel or bladder control; however, this is quite uncommon.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients will need to understand their condition and its imposed limitations based on the severity of their particular case. The clinician should review the relevant anatomy and explain the disruption, using spinal models if necessary. A review of the patient's activities and physical demands is prudent (e.g., heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, etc.). Based on the severity of the condition, the clinician may impose physical limitations.

# Pearls and Other Issues

Many patients will improve with a nonoperative treatment course directed at activity modification.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patients with low back pain are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, therapist, orthopedic nurse, primary care physician, an orthopedic surgeon. The initial treatment for low back pain is non-surgical and involves a change in lifestyle. Most patients can benefit from exercise, weight loss, and leading an active lifestyle. Surgery is only a recommendation when there is nerve compression, or the patient has failed conservative treatment. The patient must understand that surgery is not always effective, and many patients still experience residual pain and limited range of motion of the lumbar spine. The patient needs to understand that while surgical intervention has favorable outcomes for relieving radicular pains, the results are less predictable for non-radiating lower back pain.
