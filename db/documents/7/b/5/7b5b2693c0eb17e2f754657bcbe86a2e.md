The determination of gestational age is vital to providing quality prenatal care.

- Knowing the gestational age allows appropriate care to the mother without compromising maternal or fetal status.

- Knowing the gestation age allows for the correct timing of management, such as administering steroids for fetal lung maturity, starting ASA therapy with a history of pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancies, and starting Makena for previous preterm deliveries.
