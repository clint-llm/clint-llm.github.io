Peripheral venous ultrasound (US) is commonly used to diagnose and evaluate venous disease, including acute thromboembolism, postthrombotic syndrome, and chronic venous insufficiency. Venous duplex ultrasound is quick to perform and easily accessible. It is noninvasive and offers no radiation risk to the patient. When evaluating acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), ultrasonography is 97% sensitive for proximal DVT and 57% sensitive for calf DVT.

Venous thromboembolism refers to the formation of blood clots in the venous structures. The annual incidence of DVT is 1 in 1000, and DVT is responsible for > 250,000 hospitalizations a year in the United States.

Postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) refers to the late complications of venous thromboembolism. The cumulative incidence after symptomatic DVT is 15% to 50%, with most cases developing in 1 to 2 years.

Signs and symptoms of PTS often overlap with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a term denoting impaired venous return usually reserved for the superficial system. CVI arises from a combination of genetic predisposition and risk factors such as age, female gender, obesity, and prolonged standing.

Common clinical symptoms shared with PTS and CVI include pain, cramps, itching, swelling, skin changes, and venous ectasia. The Villalta score is specific for PTS and informs diagnosis, severity, and management stratification.
