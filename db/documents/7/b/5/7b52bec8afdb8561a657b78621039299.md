Pituitary hyperplasia is an under-recognized manifestation that can occur fairly commonly in primary hypothyroidism. It occurs due to the lack of negative feedback on the pituitary and hypothalamus. The presentation and imaging can mimic a pituitary mass. Patients can present with features of hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, and even visual field defects if the hyperplastic pituitary gland compresses the optic chiasm. Recognition of this entity is important as the primary modality of treatment is mainly thyroid hormone replacement and not surgery.
