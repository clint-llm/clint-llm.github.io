**Pre-Scan Discussion**

- Patients can tolerate laying on the back for up to 10 minutes.

- If the patient is greater than 300 pounds, they will require alternative BMD testing. Different models have different weight restrictions, and the system owner’s manual should be checked.

- Recent medical imaging with contrast, such as barium or gadolinium, will preclude imaging 2 weeks after contrast was administered

- Premenopausal patients should be asked whether there is any possibility that they might be pregnant. A pregnancy test may need to be administered before the examination.

- Calcium tablets should not be taken in the 24 hours before the examination

- Patients should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes with the avoidance of metal components such as zippers.

- If prior DEXA was done, the patient should be instructed to bring results.

- For body composition studies, patients should be scanned in the morning after a 12-hour overnight fast for consistency.

**Examination Day Discussion**

- Confirm they have complied with the recommendations listed above

- The menopausal status should be re-checked and whether a pregnancy test or question relating to possible pregnancy has been administered

- Subjects should be dressed in a hospital gown or scrubs, wearing only underpants and, if necessary, thin socks. A thin sheet may be placed over subjects for warmth.

- All radio-opaque objects should be removed from the scan area.
