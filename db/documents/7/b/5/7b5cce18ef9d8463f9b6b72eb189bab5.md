Tapia syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, made principally upon clinical grounds. In patients who have undergone orotracheal intubation, the onset of signs and symptoms often occurs very quickly after extubating and usually includes hoarseness, difficulties in speech and swallowing, and ipsilateral tongue deviation upon protrusion.

A complete history and detailed neurological examination are required to exclude other findings and confirm whether the cause is central or peripheral. Intracranial nerve lesions present with upper motor neuron signs and simultaneous palsies of other nerves, whereas extracranial injuries generally result in isolated nerve palsies. Any additional localizing signs should be discussed and referred to relevant specialists for further investigation and management.

Aktas and Boga proposed in 2010 a classification and treatment protocol for Tapia syndrome that has not yet been validated. This provides a practical framework for diagnosis but should be used for guidance purposes only.

Aktas and Boga Classification

Signs and Symptoms

Treatment

Grade I

Mild

Unilateral cord and tongue paralysis, no uvula distortion, the minimal slowdown in speaking, no tongue swelling, no swallowing problems

Corticosteroid treatment not recommended

Grade II

Moderate

Unilateral cord and tongue paralysis, no uvula distortion, the mild slowdown in speaking, tongue swelling, pharynx dryness, trouble swallowing, cracked speech

15 days of corticosteroid treatment recommended (first 3 days intravenously; followed by oral route)

Grace III

Severe

Unilateral cord and tongue paralysis, significant uvula distortion, great difficulty in speaking, tongue swelling, pharynx dryness, trouble swallowing, challenges in feeding and drinking

1 week of intravenous corticosteroid treatment recommendedÂ  (1 mg/kg per day)
