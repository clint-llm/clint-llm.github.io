Scleritis can be idiopathic or caused by infectious or noninfectious conditions. Additionally, associations with malignancy, autoimmune diseases, and surgically induced or medication side effects are causative factors. Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites can cause infectious scleritis and are reported to occur in 4% to 10% of all cases.

Surgically induced scleritis has been associated with pterygium removal and scleral buckle procedures. Medications used to treat osteoporosis such as bisphosphonatesÂ have been found to cause scleritis; however, reports of this occurrence are rare.
