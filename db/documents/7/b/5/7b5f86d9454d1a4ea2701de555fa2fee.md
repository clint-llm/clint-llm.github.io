- An extensive diagnostic workup is usually not necessary in healthy patients with acute hiccup presentations

- Acute hiccups can often be easily terminated by maneuvers that increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide or stimulate the vagus nerve

- Persistent hiccups can result from a variety of medications especially dexamethasone, benzodiazepines, opioids, chemotherapeutics, and anti-Parkinson medications

- GERD is a common cause of persistent hiccups, and antacids, antihistamines or proton pump inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy especially when no other cause is identifiable

- GABA agonists and dopamine antagonists are standard recommendations for persistent hiccups especially in cases caused by cancer or neurologic disease

- Intractable hiccups unrelieved by medications may require invasive intervention such as vagal nerve stimulator or stellate or phrenic nerve block
