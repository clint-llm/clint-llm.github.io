Multiple nerves have been recognized as integral components of the physiological act of swallowing. Coordination by these nerves allows us to masticate, elevate our palate, and propel a food bolus toward and down the esophagus. The primary nerves involved include CN V3, IX, X, XII, the ansa cervicalis, and the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Pharyngeal sensation is achieved chiefly via CN IX. The upper esophagus is innervated by CN X, while the splanchnic plexus and CN X innervate the lower esophagus. The splanchnic plexus keeps the lower esophageal sphincter contracted, while the parasympathetic input via CN X relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).
