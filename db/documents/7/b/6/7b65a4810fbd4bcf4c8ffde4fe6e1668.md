Whereas steroid-based treatment was the initial recommendation, the newer understanding that CTK is a distinct syndrome that is likely non-inflammatory in nature has caused a dramatic shift in management. Though topical steroids do have an important use in the treatment of DLK stages I-III which may precede, or coexist with CTK, steroids may worsen disease progression in patients with CTK.

While there is no standard of care for the treatment of CTK, other medical management options may be beneficial. As keratinocytes regenerate and produce stromal extracellular matrix, metalloproteases may slow healing and contribute to the development of CTK.

Since the opacity is not limited to the interface and expands down into the stroma, in addition to the fact that stomal loss is a prominent aspect of the disease, invasive flap lift, and irrigation are generally not recommended for fear of further tissue loss and thinning. However, some authors have proposed that surgical interventions do have a place in management

Regardless of the decision to manage solely by medical means, or to implement a surgical intervention as well, patients should be followed closely with serial topography, tomography, confocal microscopy, and OCT imaging to better monitor corneal thickness and changes in visual acuity. Additionally, monitoring patients in this way may contribute to a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and long-term effects that may result from CTK.
