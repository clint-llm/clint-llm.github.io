To establish a diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, a variety of other disorders, both physical and psychiatric, needs to be excluded. The three elements that confirm the diagnosis are (1) symptoms being consistent with PMS, (2) the symptoms should occur consistently only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and (3) negative impact on the patient's function and lifestyle. Once the physician is highly suspicious of the diagnosis, patients should be advised to keep a diary for premenstrual symptoms for consecutive months to assess for cycle-to-cycle variability.

An initial workup for diagnosis could also include ruling out other pathologies like thyroid disorders, Cushing syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia, as such ordering follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, and cortisol should be done.
