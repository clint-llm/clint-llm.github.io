It is not always possible to differentiate congenital melanocytic nevi from acquired melanocytic nevi solely on a histologic basis. CMN are composed of melanocytes that are arranged in nests and which can be located in the dermo-epidermal junction, dermis, or they may be compound. They usually present a V-shaped configuration on lower magnification, and they often involve deep areas of the dermis, sometimes reaching the subcutaneous fat or the fascia. They tend to surround appendageal structures such as sweat glands and follicles, as well as blood vessels and nerves. Cytological atypia is generally minimal or absent. Melanocytes are commonly larger in the superficial area of the lesion, diminishing in size as we go deeper. This is referred to as the "maturation gradient."

Proliferative nodules (PN) constitute nodular lesions arising within CMN, which are made up of polymorphic cells. They usually have a pushing border which can deform surrounding structures. There is usually no cytological atypia or increased proliferative rate. Necrosis is usually absent. These are all useful factors in differentiating PN from melanoma.

Occasionally, CMN may exhibit "neuroid differentiation," presenting areas of spindle cells with myxoid stroma. The latter may resemble neurofibromas.
