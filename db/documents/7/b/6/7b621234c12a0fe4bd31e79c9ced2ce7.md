The prognosis in patients with spondylolysis is usually excellent. Asymptomatic individuals require no specific treatments or any modifications to activities of daily living or athletic activities. Even patients who present with symptomatic spondylolysis usually have a very favorable prognosis as validated by a recent meta-analysis which demonstrated that theÂ  92% of the adolescent athletes were able to return to competitions when they are treated conservatively, and 90% of the time when managed surgically.
