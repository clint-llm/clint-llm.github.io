Obstructive uropathy is a disorder of the urinary tract that occurs due to obstructed urinary flow and can be either structural or functional. The back-up of urine into the unilateral or bilateral kidneys, depending on the location of the obstruction, causes hydronephrosis. The obstruction can present as a motley of symptoms but will typically involve a combination of difficultly initiating micturition, acute urinary retention, or lower abdominal discomfort and distention. The condition can be acute or chronic. It can occur across all age groups and demographics. This article will provide a detailed review of obstructive uropathy.
