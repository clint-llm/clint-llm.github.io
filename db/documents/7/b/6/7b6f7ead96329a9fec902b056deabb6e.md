Surgical instrument sets depend on the procedure for which lymph node dissection is performed. The operating room, as well as anesthesia equipment, is necessary. Sometimes laparoscopic method may be a choice by surgeons like in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. In this case, a laparoscopic tower, as well as laparoscopic instrumentsÂ (laparoscope, needle driver for suturing, trocars, bowel grasper), are needed for this surgical procedure.
