The indications for cardioplegia include the need for myocardial protection and a motionless, bloodless field during on-pump cardiac surgery. Patients will receive anterograde cardioplegia; however, retrograde cardioplegia may be used as well. Indications for retrograde cardioplegia include moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, severe coronary artery stenosis, previous coronary artery bypass with a patent graft such as the internal mammary artery essentially providing an external source of perfusion, or an anticipated prolonged pump time such as in the repair of the aortic root or valve. Inadequate cardioplegia distribution may result in myocardial cell damage with ischemia following aortic cross-clamping and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass.
