Discharge planning should be focused onÂ preventing any further accidental episodes of opioid overdoses. All patients treated for a suspected opioid overdose should be discharged with a prescription for naloxone pen or naloxone nasal spray along with verbal and written instructions on its use. Patient teaching should be focused on instructing the patient to never take prescribed opioids in greater amounts than prescribed, to make the physician aware of any side effects, and to avoid taking opioids with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or muscle relaxants.
