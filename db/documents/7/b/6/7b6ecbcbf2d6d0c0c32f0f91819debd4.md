Healthcare professionalsÂ required for undertaking an enucleation procedure are an ophthalmic surgeon, ophthalmic nurses, theatre scrub nurse, and medical assistants. A psychologist may be consulted before the procedure as part of the consent process, and an ocularist will be needed to produce a prosthesis as part of the patient's rehabilitation management. All children undergoing an enucleation or evisceration should be counseled by a child psychologist. Explanatory books for children and parents are also available to help make the process less traumatic.
