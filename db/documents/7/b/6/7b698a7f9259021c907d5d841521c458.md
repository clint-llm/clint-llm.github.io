Few other processes present with pneumaturia. These include:

- Recent instrumentation of bladder can be determined with a detailed history

- Urinary tract infection (UTI) with a gas forming organism (emphysematous cystitis): Increased risk in people with diabetes and patients with urinary tract outflow obstruction. One will see air within the bladder wall on imaging. Treatment is primarily with antibiotics tailored to urinary cultures.

The etiology of the colovesicular fistula must be clear before treatment. This is evaluated with a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis first, followed by a colonoscopy. If there is suspicion for bladder malignancy, then a cystoscopy is warranted.
