Coronary artery dissection can be spontaneous, traumatic, or due to iatrogenic causes. This review will focus on spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is the non-traumatic and non-iatrogenic separation of the coronary arterial wall. It is an uncommon cause of acute myocardial infarction. It affects young to middle-aged women with men accounting for less than 10% to 15% of cases in most large contemporary series. Although historically it was thought to be rare, the increased use of early angiography to assess acute chest pain presentations has resulted in recognition of spontaneous coronary artery dissection as more common. The condition poses diagnostic challenges and significant therapeutic dilemmas given the lack of research to guide management.
