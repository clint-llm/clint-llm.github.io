After ingestion of isopropanol, patients will typically present with altered mental status. Although the differential diagnosis of a patient with an altered mental status is extensive, the mnemonic “AEIOU-TIPS” should be employed to aid the physician in narrowing down the cause of a patient’s altered sensorium:

- A – Alcohol or acidosis

- E – Electrolytes or encephalopathy

- I – Infection

- O – Overdose or oxygen disorder

- U – Uremia

- T – Trauma or toxin

- I – Insulin

- P – Psychogenic

- S – Stroke or shock

Explore secondary causes of ketosis because ingestion of isopropanol will cause ketosis without acidosis. Include diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, starvation ketosis, and other toxic alcohol ingestions in the differential.
