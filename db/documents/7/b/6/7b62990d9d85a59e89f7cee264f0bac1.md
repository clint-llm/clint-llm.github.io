Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the developed world is now seen as a chronic illness due to the competency of antiretroviral therapy. Despite advancements in controlling the virus, a cure remains out of reach. Prevention is the cornerstone of stopping the HIV epidemic. This article will briefly review the efficacy and methods of various types of HIV prevention in the United States of America.

Between 2010 and 2014, the annual number and rate of diagnoses of HIV infection in the United States decreased. However, in particular subgroups, the numbers and rates increased. The number of new HIV diagnoses fell by 19% from 2005 to 2014. Rates of HIV in women and injection drug users continue to decline. However, for men who have sex with men (MSM), the rate of HIV diagnosis is up 6%. Black and Latino MSM is up 20%, and the subgroup of ages 13 to 24 is up an astounding 87%. The rate of HIV among white MSM is down 18%, but for those white MSM ages 13 to 24, the rate has increased by 56%.

HIV is transmitted through sexual fluids (vaginal and semen), blood, breast milk, and vertically (mother to child). In 2015, 94% of infections were attributed to sexual contact; 70% were male to male (including those at dual risk with a male to male sexual contact and IVDU risk), and 24% were heterosexually transmitted.
