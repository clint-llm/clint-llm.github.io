Predictive models for the prognosis of cirrhosis estimate the ten-year survival in patients with compensated cirrhosis at 47%, but this drops to 16% once a decompensating event occurs. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scoring or classification uses serum albumin, bilirubin, PT, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy to classify patients with cirrhosis into classes A, B, and C. One- and two-year survival rates for these classes are 100% and 85% (A),  80% and 60% (B), and 45% and 35% (C). The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is another model used to predict the short-term mortality of patients with cirrhosis. It uses serum bilirubin, creatinine, and INR to predict mortality within the next three months.

Liver transplantation is indicated in decompensated cirrhosis that does not respond to medical treatment. The one-year and five-year survival rates after liver transplantation are approximately 85% and 72%, respectively. Recurrence of the underlying liver disease can occur after a transplant.
