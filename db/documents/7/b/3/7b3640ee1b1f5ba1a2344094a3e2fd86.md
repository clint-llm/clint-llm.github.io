Overall, there are few distinguishing histologic characteristics of Mycoplasma. "In fatal cases, death is associated with diffuse pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, vascular thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure. Biopsy of the lung at autopsy shows bronchiolitis and focal sites of bronchiolitis obliterans with alveolar edema and intra-alveolar hemorrhages." Electron microscopy of lung tissue demonstrates Mycoplasma organisms localized on the surface of the bronchiolar epithelium. Lung biopsy also shows ulcerated mucosal surfaces, destroyed ciliated epithelium, extensive monocellular infiltration (macrophages, lymphocytes), and neutrophil infiltration.Mycoplasma pneumoniae in chronic lung disease such as asthma show cellular changes consistent with the chronic inflammatory changes described above.
