Erysipelas is a skin infection involving the dermis layer of the skin, but it may also extend to the superficial cutaneous lymphatics. It is characterized by an area of erythema that is well demarcated, raised, and often affects the lower extremities, with the face being the second most commonly affected site. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of Erysipelas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

- Recall the cause of erysipelas.
- Describe the presentation of erysipelas.
