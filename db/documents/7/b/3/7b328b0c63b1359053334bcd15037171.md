The use of the monospot test may be indicated in a patient presenting with complaints that are consistent with IM.  Signs and symptoms of IM include sore throat, fever, malaise, tonsillitis, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue.  Because of the significant overlap of symptoms with other common viral illnesses, testing is usually indicated for patients who have a prolonged course of symptomatology which is not consistent with typical upper respiratory viral infections.  Further, because peak heterophile antibody levels are seen between 2 to 6 weeks from infection, testing too early in the disease process may lead to increased rates of false negative testing.

The monospot test is not indicated for patients under the age of four years old as false-negative test results are unacceptably high.  Sensitivity rates for this age group range from 27 to 76%.
