Osteoporosis is, in general, a silent disease until there is a fragility fracture, and the high suspicion of the disease is what should drive the request for testing.

It has been linked with low bone mass and reduced bone mass index.

In the physical exam, there may also be thoracic kyphosis and loss of height from vertebral compression fractures, but more frequently, osteoporosis is initially completely asymptomatic, and it is usually detected either by a DXA scan or by a fragility fracture.
