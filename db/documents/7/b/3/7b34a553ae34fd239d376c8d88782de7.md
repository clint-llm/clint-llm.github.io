Obtaining a thorough history is critical in evaluating a patient with a suspected brain injury. Though the patient will unlikely be able to provide a good history, one should gather as much information from those who may have witnessed the incident. It is especially important to determine how the injury occurred,Â if there is any seizure or concussion history, if alcohol or illicit drug use was involved, whether or not there was any loss of consciousness, any resultant weakness or paresthesias, difficulty walking, or incontinence of the bladder or bowel.

Patients who have experienced significant injury or loss of consciousness, continued symptoms, deterioration in neurologic function, or neurologic deficits should be evaluated with imaging studies.

Screening for alcohol or illicit drugs would be recommended. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the preferred imaging modality for acute head trauma. It is a more sensitive imaging modality for detecting acute hemorrhage (e.g., non-enhanced CT). It provides better delineation of bone (e.g., for detecting any skull fractures) and more sensitive in detecting acute hemorrhage and identifying any surgically reversible injuries.

Current guidelines recommend a CT for a suspected skull fracture, intracranial bleeding, or other intracranial disorders based on physical exam findings.
