Cavernous angiomas, also referred to as cavernous malformations (CMs), cavernous hemangiomas, or cavernomas are benign intracranial vascular malformations that form during development. Vascular malformations involve every organ and are grouped into four types according to gross and histopathologic characteristics: capillary malformations, also called telangiectasias, cavernous malformations, also called cavernous angiomas or hemangiomas, venous malformations, and arteriovenous shunting malformations. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with cavernous brain angiomas.

**Objectives:**
- Identify some differential diagnoses for cerebral microhemorrhage.
- Review the evaluation of new-onset seizure with the evaluation of focal neurologic deficits presumed to be due to recurrent hemorrhages. 
- Explain how to proceed once a diagnosis of familial cerebral cavernous malformation has been made.
- Summarize a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by cavernous angiomas.
