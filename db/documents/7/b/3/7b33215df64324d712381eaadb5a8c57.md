In the clinical setting, the myotatic reflex receives a grade on a scale, with a number score given based on the physical quality of the muscle contraction and subsequent limb flexion or extension elicited by the initial induced mechanical stretch. This score, ranging from zero to four, can help clinicians not only diagnosis neurological and system diseases but also accurately predict disease outcomes and grossly locate neurological lesions.

**Myotatic Reflex Scoring:**

- **0: No contraction.**This lack of response is always considered pathological, though not definitive, for any specific neurological disease.

- **1: Weak, slight response.**This response can be pathological or physiological.

- **2: Brisk reflex.**The normal, non-pathological reflex.

- **3: Increased, greater than brisk response, with the absence of clonus.**This response can be pathological or physiological.

- **4: Elicitation of clonus.**Characterized by repeated rhythmic contractions in the agonist muscle group, clonus is always considered a pathological finding.

In addition to this basic reflex scoring system, the number score designated to an elicited reflex can also have a “+“ or “-” to additionally help characterize reflexes that the provider considers slightly greater than or less than a particular numerical value.

The myotatic reflex has vital utility in helping physicians localize a neurological lesion or pathology to either the central nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Hyperreflexia, designated by a reflex score of 3 or 4, is often a supportive exam finding in patients with upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions or injury, grossly meaning an injury to the CNS. An UMN lesion is also frequently concomitant with exam findings of muscle spasticity and the absence of muscle fasciculations and commonly associated with conditions such as paraplegia, tetraplegia, hemiplegia, and diplegiaHyporeflexia, designated by a reflex score of zero or one is often a supportive exam finding in patients with lower motor neuron (LMN) lesions or injury, grossly meaning damage to the PNS, for example, the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerves, or the neuromuscular junction or the muscle itself. A LMN lesion is also frequently concomitant with exam findings of muscle flaccidity, hypotonia, and fasciculations and commonly associated with conditions such as myopathies and neuropathies.

Hypo- and hyperreflexia can also be normal physiological exam variation as a result of aging, with children and young individuals commonly having more brisk reflexes and elderly individuals having non-pathological decreased reflexes. These same findings can also be representative of metabolic dysfunction, including electrolyte imbalance, thyroid dysfunction, liver and/or kidney disease, medication toxicity, and neoplastic process.
