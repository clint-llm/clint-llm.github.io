Prompt evaluation and treatment are paramount to resolving the infection and optimizing outcomes for patients. If unrecognized or inadequately treated, infections may progress to involve contiguous structures, resulting in greater morbidity to patients. Functional limitations and neurovascular compromise may arise as a result of mismanagement. Other complications include stiffness, tendon rupture, joint destruction, osteomyelitis, nerve compression, and wound complications requiring amputation or flap coverage.
