The differential diagnosis for esophageal webs and rings is extensive and includes other causes of dysphagia. History and evaluation by barium swallow and/or EGD can help identify those causes. Conditions that may mimic webs and rings include achalasia and esophageal strictures. Achalasia presents with progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids. The classic finding on barium swallow is distal dilatation of the esophagus with a “bird-beak” appearance.
