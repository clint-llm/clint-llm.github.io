- Emphysema is an abnormal dilatation, due to destruction, of the walls of alveoli and respiratory bronchioles. It isÂ often due to cigarette smoking.

- AAT deficiency is a genetic cause for emphysema.

- The spirometry in patients with emphysema would show the obstruction.

- Apart from smoking cessation, inhaler therapy is effective in most patients.

- LAMA can be used as a single preventive therapy along with rescue inhalers. Combination of LABA/LAMA is not inferior to LABA/ICS. In advanced cases, a combination of LABA/LAMA/ICS would be indicated. ICS alone without LABA is not recommended for the treatment of COPD.

- Lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation would be necessary for select patients.

- Complications include decompensated respiratory failure which can be life-threatening.
