In phagocytosis, the plasma membrane of a cell is directed by cytoskeletal filaments to form pseudopodia (fake arms) that act to engulf a particle and bring it into the cell from the extracellular matrix. Once engulfed, the particle remains compartmentalized in an intracellular vesicle known as a phagosome and eventually undergoes lysosomal degradation in the phagocytic pathway. Phagocytosis is primarily a eukaryotic process.

Since phagocytosis is a cell-mediated process involving the transport of a substance from the extracellular matrix into the cell, it is considered a form of endocytosis. Specifically, phagocytosis is a form of endocytosis that only involves the transport of larger particles (greater than 0.5 micrometers), such as bacteria or cellular debris. Phagocytosis is also described as a destructive endocytosis due to the fate of particles being endocytosed.

The discovery of phagocytosis was made by Dr. Ilya Mechnikov, a pioneering scientist in the fields of immunology and zoology. The term “phagocytosis” derives from the Greek words “phagein” and “kytos,” which roughly translates to the phrase “to devour cell” – fittingly describing what this process appears to resemble under the microscope.
