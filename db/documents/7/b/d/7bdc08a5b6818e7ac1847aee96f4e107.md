Many patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) can live healthy, symptom-free lives. The decision to have surgery involves weighing the risk of aneurysmal rupture against the risks and benefits of the surgical procedure. While the aneurysm size and the rate at which it enlarges are included in some general guidelines, each treatment decision should be made individually. Clinicians should discuss the surgical risks with their patients so they can make informed decisions.
