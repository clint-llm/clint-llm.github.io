While different surgeons and different institutions will have different instrument sets available, extended SMAS rhytidectomy typically requires a #10 and a #15 blade scalpel, facelift retractor and light source, facelift scissors, Trepsat dissectors, needle drivers, forceps, electrocautery, suction, and sutures for both soft tissue suspension and skin closure. Heavy 2-0 polyglactin sutures are used to suspend the SMAS flap. Finer 5-0 polypropylene is used for skin closure anterior to the auricle, and 4-0 to 6-0 absorbable sutures, such as plain gut, are used to close the remainder of the incision. A bulky compression dressing is typically applied at the conclusion of the procedure.
