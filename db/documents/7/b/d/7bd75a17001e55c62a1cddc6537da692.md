History and physical examination are extremely important for the diagnosis of dysphagia. Common related symptoms are:

- Choking and coughing

- Eating meals more slowly

- Throat clearance during or after meals

- A feeling of food stuck in the mid-chest or the throat

- Frequent pulmonary infections

- Weight loss

- Changes in diet consistency of food, preference to liquids and semisolids

- Neurological changes

Physical signs include:

- Loss of dentition

- Abnormal lip closure

- Local changes

- Neurological changes

Oropharyngeal dysphagia should be differentiated from esophageal dysphagia. Each should be considered as a distinct group.

The presence of one or more of these symptoms can predict oropharyngeal dysphagia:

- A delay in oropharyngeal initiation of swallowing

- Deglutitive cough

- Nasal aspiration during swallowing

- There is a need for a repetitive swallow to clear the nasal secretion

Patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia should be considered for a barium swallow. They should also be referred to a neurologist, otolaryngologist, and speech pathologist for further assessment.

Dysphagia can be of acute onset as in stroke. However, in most other conditions causing dysphagia, the symptoms are slowly progressive.Â Patients who find it difficult to swallow solid food usually suffer from obstruction such as esophageal web, ring, or stricture. Patients who struggle to drink liquids are more likely to have dysphagia due to neurological lesions.
