The most common symptom in children is headache; therefore, the importance of a detailed history and a thorough physical examination is vital in making the diagnosis.

There is a slight difference in migraine among children compared to adults because the latter is mainly frontal rather than temporal/occipital and bilateral rather than unilateral.

A thorough physical examination is needed, including blood pressure measurement and palpation of the head in search of sinus tenderness and nuchal rigidity. A funduscopic examination is necessary to look for papilledema, hemorrhage, or other signs of increased intracranial pressure. A visual field examination should be done.
