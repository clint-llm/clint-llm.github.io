There are normally two muscles in the lateral leg compartment, the FLM and FBM.

The FBT inserts onto the lateral aspect of the tuberosity at the base of the 5th metatarsal.

The FLTÂ  travels inferolateral along the calcaneus, and when it reaches the cuboid bone, the FLT tendon may have an os peroneum (a fibrocartilaginous nodule) that articulates with the cuboid, forming the peroneocuboid joint. The presence of this joint is variable. Distal to the cuboid, the FLT makes a sharp turn, passing between the calcaneal tuberosity and the base of the 5th metatarsal, traversing the cuboid tunnel anteromedially, and entering the plantar aspect of the foot. From there, the FLT inserts onto the base of the first metatarsal, with its synovial tendon sheath ending right before it inserts. Variable insertions of the FLT include the medial cuneiform, the plantar aspect of the base of the 2nd- 5th metatarsals, and the first dorsal interosseous muscle.
