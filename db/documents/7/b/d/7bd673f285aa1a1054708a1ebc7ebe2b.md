The patient will receive the best care if the interprofessional healthcare team works together in an integrated fashion. Collaboration and shared decision-making are the keys to a good outcome. Patients depending on their indication to use mifepristone, will be treated in a variety of locations. Health care providers need to be aware of red flag symptoms if the patient experiences an adverse reaction. For instances of heavy bleeding, the clinician, RN, lab technician, and the pharmacist all need to work together to determine the patient's hemodynamic stability status and find a solution. If the patient develops a bacterial infection, the medical team in recovery needs to start the workup and continue to follow up. The entire team must work together to give the patient support from all angles; this can be especially important for females after losing a pregnancy. Social work support can be important in this case. Patients may require both pre and post-elective abortion counseling. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, health care professionals can ensure the optimum use of mifepristone in their patients. [Level 5]
