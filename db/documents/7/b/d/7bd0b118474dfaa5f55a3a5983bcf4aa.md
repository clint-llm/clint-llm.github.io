In a healthy state, coronaries empty blood into the capillary bed of the myocardium. CAVF drains blood into the low-pressure vasculature like cardiac chambers, pulmonary artery, coronary sinus, and superior vena cava bypassing the capillaries. This vascular anatomy deprives the myocardium of blood supply leading to a coronary steal phenomenon resulting in cardiac ischemia. Left to right shunt leads to volume overload to the right heart leading to hyperkinetic pulmonary artery hypertension and right-sided congestive heart failure. The majority of patients with small fistula are asymptomatic. Patients with large fistula and left to right shunt with coronary steal phenomenon present with angina.
