Peak serum concentrations of cephalexin are seen approximately one hour after a single dose. The serum half-life is 1 to 2 hours, but this can increase to up to 22 hours in patients with drastically reduced creatinine clearance. Additionally, patients on hemodialysis experience an increased half-life of approximately 4 to 5 hours. Patients should ingest cephalexin on an empty stomach, as food consumption delays the onset of the drug and lowers the peak concentration. Also, consuming food with cephalexin can prolong the time the drug is detectable in the serum.

Additionally, as cephalexin is excreted by kidneys in unchanged form, patients with renal impairment may have prolonged excretion rates of cephalexin.

Monitor blood sugar levels when a patient on metformin is administered cephalexin, as there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

Cephalosporin, including cephalexin, might cause prolongation in prothrombin time. Monitor prothrombin time especially in patients with malnutrition, renal or hepatic impairment, using the anticoagulation treatment and antibiotics chronically.
