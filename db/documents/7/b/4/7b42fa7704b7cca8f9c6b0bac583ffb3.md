Zileuton is a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor primarily used for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic asthma for patients aged 12 and older.

Research has also shown zileuton to help treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), upper airway inflammatory conditions, and dermatological conditions such as acne, pruritic in Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, and atopic dermatitis.
