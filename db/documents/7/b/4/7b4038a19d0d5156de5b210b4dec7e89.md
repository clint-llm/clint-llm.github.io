Since postoperative treatments for ventral cord syndrome are often ineffectual, measures to prevent perioperative cord ischemia should include avoiding anemia, systemic hypotension, and hyperextension/hyperflexion during positioning. Efforts must be made to minimize any surgical accidents resulting in vascular dissection.

Tetraplegia and paraplegia are amongst the most devastating consequences of ventral cord syndrome. These movement impediments have a significant medical, social, and financial cost to both the individual and society. Since no current treatment can reverse ventral cord syndrome, patients must receive rehabilitation focused on improving independence and quality of life all while preventing secondary complications of spinal cord injury. Patients are candidates for several forms of rehabilitation including but not limited to physical, occupational, vocational, and neuropsychological therapies.
