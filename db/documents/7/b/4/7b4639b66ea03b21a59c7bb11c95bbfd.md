The incidence of adverse effects with therapeutic baclofen dosing varies between 10 to 65%.

With increasing off-label use of baclofen, such as alcohol use disorder, intractable hiccups, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety, there is an increase in the cases of intentional and accidental baclofen toxicity. A French retrospective study looking at intentional baclofen overdoses saw an increase from 8 cases in 2001 to 91 cases in 2015.
