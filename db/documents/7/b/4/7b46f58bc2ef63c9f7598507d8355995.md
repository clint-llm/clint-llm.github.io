Several conditions stated below prevent the use of disopyramide as an antiarrhythmic drug:

- Overt heart failure; disopyramide is known to have negative inotropic effects resulting in decreased heart ejection fraction.

- Second or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker present; In a heart that is free from the influence of vagal tone, disopyramide can worsen the current AV conduction status.

- Long QT syndromes: disopyramide and other class Ia antiarrhythmics can prolong the QT interval.

- Hypersensitivity to the drugs itself or its components
