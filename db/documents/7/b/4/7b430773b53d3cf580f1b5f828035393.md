Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classical hallucinogen. No approved indications for LSD-assisted therapy exist today. It has been used in the past for non-FDA approved indications: depressive disorders including those with conversion phobia, neurosis, manic-depression, and reactive depression, cyclothymic (obsessional) and passive-aggressive (obsessional) compulsive sexual deviation addiction, psychoneurotic disorders, mixed, pan-neuroticism (including schizophrenia), borderline or latent and personality disorders (especially transient situational). This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile/toxicity, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of LSD, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team should they encounter patients who misuse or have misused this drug.

**Objectives:**
- Review the proposed mechanism of action of LSD.
- Describe the adverse event profile of LSD.
- Summarize the toxicity that can accompany LSD use.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who are currently or have previously misused LSD.
