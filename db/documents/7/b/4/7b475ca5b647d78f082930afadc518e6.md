LS endocarditis is not a common condition, but when it presents, it often correlates with high morbidity and mortality. The healthcare team, including the pharmacists and nurses, should be aware that the vegetations can embolize not only to the brain but also to the extremities and intestine. If this is not recognized, then it can result in ischemia and necrosis of the organ involved. Serial echos are required to follow the vegetations.

The treatment for LS endocarditis is not well established, but anticoagulation is the recommendation. The outcomes depend on the age of the patient, the presence of malignancy, and other comorbidities.

The following consultations may be necessary:

Cardiologist - To assist with the assessment of the nature and severity of valvular disease, heart failure management, and evaluation for coexistent lupus cardiac pathology.

Cardiac surgeon - If valve replacement is required

Rheumatologist - For suspected underlying systemic lupus erythematosus

Infectious disease specialist - Suggested to address potential sepsis or secondary infective endocarditis.

Neurologist - For cerebrovascular complications
