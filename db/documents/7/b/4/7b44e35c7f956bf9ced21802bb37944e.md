Meissner corpuscles are an integral aspect of the human sensory system, required for discriminatory touch and grip control. The high sensitivity of these receptors also allows for the reading of Braille using the fingertips. Males and females have a similar number of corpuscles in each digit, although, given the larger average surface area of male hands and fingers, men have a lower density of receptors which may contribute to a small difference in touch receptivity.

Differences in corpuscular density have been associated with a number of neurologic disorders, including sensory neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV neuropathy, and Friedreichâ€™s ataxia.

Meissner corpuscles can survive for long-periods following nerve injury or denervation but can sustain alterations in protein expression. Expression of S100, a marker of lamellar cells within Meissner corpuscles, has been shown to be normal following spinal cord injury, diminished in nerve entrapment, and absent in denervated dermatomes.
