The cellular mechanism that leads to necrosis is the loss of cell membrane integrity as a result of exposure to a noxious stimulus; this allows extracellular ions to move inside the cell, followed by fluid leading to eventual swelling of the cell and its organelles. Another cellular mechanism is the disruption of the lysosomal membrane, which leads to the release of proteolytic enzymes into the cell, such as proteases, RNAase, DNAases, and phosphatases. These, when activated in the cytosol, leading to damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins.

Histopathological features

There are different patterns of necrosis based on the nature of the insult and the tissue:

- Single-cell - single, noncontiguous cells in a tissue that are characterized by swelling of the cell and nucleus and pale cytoplasm

- Focal - Contain contiguous cells

- Multifocal

- Diffuse - Contain contiguous cells

- Centrilobular

- Zonal

The main features of necrosis are:

- Swelling of the cell

- Swelling of the nucleus

- Karyolysis (nuclear dissolution)

- Karyorrhexis (nuclear fragmentation)

- Nuclear pyknosis

- Pale eosinophilic cytoplasm

- Cytoplasmic vacuoles may be present in areas of necrosis

- Adjacent cellular debris and inflammatory cells may be present if there is leakage of the cell membrane
