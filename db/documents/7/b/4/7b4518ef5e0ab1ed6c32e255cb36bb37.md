The myasthenic crisis should be differentiated from the cholinergic crisis with edrophonium test. Administration of 2 mg of edrophonium will worsen the clinical symptom in cholinergic crisis. The contrary is the case in myasthenic crisis. Other causes of cholinergic crisis like exposure to nerve gas, organophosphates and use of reversal agent for neuromuscular blockage should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
