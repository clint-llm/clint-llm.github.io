When electrical alternans is present on an ECG, further evaluation is needed to find the underlying cause as mentioned above. When considering a pericardial effusion, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the first-line imaging modality. In the unstable patient, bedside echocardiogram is even more important as TTE provides very high sensitivity (near 100%) in diagnosing pericardial effusion.
