**Measurement of Serum Bilirubin**

Serum bilirubin is measured spectrophotometrically when the molecule undergoes a reaction with diazo reagents causing the breakdown of the tetrapyrrole to two azodipyrroles. This reaction is termed as the “Van den Bergh.”  Unconjugated bilirubin reacts slowly with the diazo reagent as the central carbon bridge of bilirubin is buried within the hydrogen bonds. In contrast, conjugated bilirubin lacks these hydrogen bonds, and the reaction occurs rapidly even in the absence of accelerators. The addition of accelerators such as caffeine or methanol disrupts the hydrogen bonds, and the reaction is quickly completed yielding the value of total bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin is measured by subtracting the direct-reacting fraction from total bilirubin. Potential sources of error include plasma lipids, drugs such as propranolol, and several other endogenous substances. These interfere with the diazo assay and can potentially produce an unreliable result.
