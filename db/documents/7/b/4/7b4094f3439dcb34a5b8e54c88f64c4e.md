**Education and Information**

- Because oral anticoagulants are widely used in many types of patients and since many of these patients have comorbid disorders which require consultation with other specialists, all healthcare staff need to have some type of education on these medications.

- All physicians who prescribe, dispense or administer these agents should be assessed for competence, knowledge, dosing, and potential interactions of the different oral anticoagulants.

- Whenever a new oral anticoagulant is added to the formulary, all the staff need to be notified about it by either a newsletter, email, electronic notification, and/or an in-service. Since educational programs often have limitations, the product detail should be sent to all staff via the intranet.

- Whenever a new oral anticoagulant is added to the formulary, update the information such as antidotes, monitoring, and potential adverse effects.

- All patients on oral anticoagulants and oral antiplatelet agents are at a risk for bleeding, and thus healthcare workers who prescribe this combination must be fully aware of the risk and follow the patient closely.
