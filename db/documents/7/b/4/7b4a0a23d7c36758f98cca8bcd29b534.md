Although first being described in 1887 by Chiari, the etiology of salpingitis isthmica nodosa is frequently unknown. There are currently three proposed etiologies: infection, cellular invasion, and congenital malformations.

The most widely accepted of these states that infection during a woman’s reproductive years triggers a chronic inflammatory process within the fallopian tube. Researchers have demonstrated that females who have previous histological signs of salpingitis often have the outer membrane protein of C. trachomatis in the affected fallopian tube and/ or high serum antibody titers.Chlamydia infection and SIN. Another study demonstrated that 89% of women with SIN had evidence of inflammation in the affected tube. They concluded that SIN was either a direct complication of infection during reproductive years or that early infection increases the likelihood of future infections, which ultimately lead to SIN.

The non-inflammatory theory states that SIN results from an overgrowth of the inner layer of the fallopian tube, which eventually invades the mucosal wall.

Finally, the congenital theory, originally formulated by von Recklinghausen in 1896, states that the tube-like glands are, in fact, Wolffian rests. This is explained by the fact that the isthmus is the location where the Wolffian and Mullerian ducts cross during development. Other previously suggested etiologies include chronic tubal spasm and neoplasia.
