Nivolumab is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The most common dosing regimens are 240 mg every two weeks or 480 mg every four weeks. Dosing depends on the indication. Nivolumab can be diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution or in 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. Regardless of the diluent used, immediate use after solution preparation is advised. Nivolumab may be given as a combination therapy with Ipilimumab for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced RCC, and metastatic CRC (MSI-H or dMMR).

When given in combination, nivolumab must precede the Ipilimumab infusion, and separate infusion bags must be used. In general, nivolumab should not be mixed with or given on the same intravenous line as another drug. Until its administration, nivolumab should be stored under refrigeration at 2 to 8 degrees C (36 F to 46 F), protected from light (in its original packaging). It should not be frozen nor shaken.
