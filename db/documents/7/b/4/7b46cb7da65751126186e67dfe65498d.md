The management of patients with binge eating disorder should beÂ with the help of an interprofessional team, including a medical clinician, psychologist, psychiatrists, pharmacists, nutritionists, social workers, educational professionals, endocrinologists, and nurses. Counseling from nutritionists plays an essential role in organizing and planning meals as well as behavioral weight loss therapy for these patients.

Clinicians should be aware that patients with binge eating disorder are vulnerable to shame and stigma and find it distressing to share it with healthcare professionals.
