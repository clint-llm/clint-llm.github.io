Acute rotator cuff tendonitis can occur secondary to direct blows to the shoulder, poor throwing mechanics in overhead sports, or from falls on an outstretched arm.

Tendinopathy ensues after repetitive rotator cuff injury triggers a recurrent pathological cycle that results in acute on chronic tendonitis, increasing levels of tendinopathy and tendinosis, and ultimately, PTTs and/or FTTs to varying degrees of tear sizes and retraction. The exact pathogenesis of rotator cuff tears remains controversial, but most clinicians agree the underlying mechanism is comprised of a combination of extrinsic impingement from structures surrounding the cuff and intrinsic degeneration from changes within the tendon itself.
