Very little evidence is reviewed for the staging of BRONJ. So staging recommendations should be considered as consensus statements. The current staging system is developed by Ruggiero and colleagues

Stage 1 patients have exposed bone and are asymptomatic with no localized soft tissue infection.

Stage 2 patients have exposed bone, pain, and regional soft tissue inflammation or infection.

Stage 3 patients have exposed bone with associated pain, localized soft tissue inflammation (or secondary infection), pathologic fracture, and extraoral or oral-antral fistula. Radiographically, the bone show osteolysis extending to the inferior mandibular border or maxillary sinus floor.

Recently, AAOMS added stage 0 to the staging system, referring to patients who take bisphosphonates and present with non-specific clinical findings and symptoms. Term stage 0 can lead to overdiagnosis that can have detrimental effects on the patientâ€™s skeletal health if modification of anti-resorptive medication regimen is done as similar presenting symptoms may lead to a different diagnosis
