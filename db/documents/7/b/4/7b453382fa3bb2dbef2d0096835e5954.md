There are currently multiple approved options for PVS. These include synthetic, autologous, xenograft, and allograft materials. The ideal implanted material incorporates into the host's tissue providing long-lasting suburethral support. Selection depends on both patient factors and surgeon experience. Synthetic and other biomaterials have become popular due to decreased operative time and post-operative recovery. However, autologous materials are the gold standard for PVS due to minimal inflammatory and foreign-body reactions.

A decision needs to be made preoperatively regarding which type of pubovaginal sling is going to be placed. The surgeon needs to make sure the hospital or surgical center has the product available if a synthetic, animal or human cadaveric sling is to be used.
