Greenstick fractures are usually seen in the pediatric population and are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the pediatrician, emergency department physician, orthopedic nurse, and orthopedic surgeon. If the degree of angulation is significant, then the healthcare provider needs to perform a closed reduction and immobilization.

The outcomes for most children are good. However, follow-up is required to ensure proper healing is occurring.
