Vitamin B6 is predominantly absorbed in the small intestine jejunum and is metabolized at the cellular level in the mitochondria and cytosol to active forms in the liver. The phosphorylated form of the vitamin is converted in dephosphorylated form and the pool of free vitamin B6 in jejunum by passive diffusion.

Vitamin B6 deficiency may present with seizures in the young. Severely deficient adults commonly present with rashes and mental status changes. Additional clinical findings of deficiency may include normocytic anemia, a nonspecific pruritic rash, cheilitis with scaly lip skin and cracks in the corner of the mouth, and glossitis (swelling of the tongue). Depression is associated with a severe B6 deficiency as well.

Current studies are evaluating the role of B6 deficiency in heart disease, cancer, and cognitive decline as medical conditions that may respond to supplementation. To date, there is no clear evidence to support supplement use beyond the normal dietary intake.Â However, some studies indicate a reduction of symptoms in the premenstrual syndrome with supplementation of B6, particularly a decrease in moodiness, irritability, and forgetfulness. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommend vitamin B6 supplementation (1.9 mg per day) for hyperemesis gravidarum.
