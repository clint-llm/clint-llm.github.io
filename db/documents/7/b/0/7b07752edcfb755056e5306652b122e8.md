ANP was first discovered in 1981 by Adolfo J de Bold.

ANP acts to increase the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within the kidney by dilating the afferent arterioles and constricting the efferent arterioles.

There have also been more recent associations made between ANP and lipid metabolism

Adiponectin is an adipokine secreted by adipose tissue. Adiponectin has regulating effects on glucose and lipid metabolism resulting in increasing insulin sensitivity, reductions in both plasma glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) levels, as well as anti-inflammatory effects.

Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that there is a genetic component to the natriuretic peptides and their receptors. ANP and BNP are both encoded by natriuretic peptide precursors A and B (NPPA & NPPB), respectively,Â t found on chromosome 1.

Another variant that studied is rs5068. This particular variant demonstrated in a large sample study to result in higher ANP levels, lower blood pressures, reduced C-reactive protein levels, as well as increased amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.
