The mammary gland is said to be a modified sweat gland made up of the parenchyma and the stroma covered by the skin. Underlying this gland are some muscles. The primary muscle, which lies deep underneath this gland is the pectoralis major muscle covered by pectoral fascia. Other muscles that are partly underneath this gland along with the pectoralis major muscle are the serratus anterior muscle and the external oblique muscle of the abdomen.

An intact pectoralis major muscle plays a crucial role in the successful reconstruction of the breastÂ and implant surgeries.
