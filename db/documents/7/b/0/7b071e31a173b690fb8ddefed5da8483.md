While in utero, patients with CdLS may present growth restriction. At birth, they present with failure to thrive, and their weight is often less than 2.2 kg. As the children grow older, they often continue to have delayed growth (usually below the 5th percentile).

- **Craniofacial:**A distinctive feature seen in children with CdLS is synophyrys, which are thick arched eyebrows that meet in the middle.

- **Neurodevelopmental**: Children may have global developmental delays, along with intellectual disability.

- **Gastrointestinal**: GERD is present in nearly all (85%) patients with CdLS, which can predispose patients to Barrett esophagus.

- **Genitourinary**: Genital hypoplasia, cryptorchidism (in 73% of males), hypospadias, renal cyst, or renal hypoplasia are common. Reports exist of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) in males with CdLS.

- **Ophthalmologic**: Dysfunctional tear ducts, ptosis, strabismus, nystagmus, myopia, astigmatism, amblyopia, cataracts, glaucoma, detached retina, and blepharitis are often a feature in children with CdLS.

- **Cardiac:**Cardiac findings in children with CdLS include murmurs, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, and atrial or ventricular septal defects.

- **Neurological**: Many patients (up to 25%) exercise seizure disorders requiring care by a neurologist. Autonomic dysfunctions and sleep-related problems (e.g., nightly apnoea and insomnia) have also been described.

- **Psychiatric**: Patients can have behavioral difficulties ranging from aggression, self-injury, to self-stimulatory behavior.

- **Dermatologic**: Hirsutism or cutis marmorata (purple skin discoloration) can present during the dermatologic examination.

- **Musculoskeletal**: Limb dysplasias, scoliosis (39%), partial toe fusion, clinodactyly (curved fifth digit), radial hypoplasia, radioulnar synostosis, shortened sternum, and pectus excavatum have been observed in patients with CdLS.

- **Respiratory:**laryngeal anomalies are rare.

- **Immunodeficiency:**Because of antibody deficiency and/or impaired T-cell function, recurrent infections (chronic ear infections, chronic viral respiratory infections, and pneumonia) can affect a variable percentage of individuals affected by CdLS.

Different scoring systems have been proposed to graduate the severity of the syndrome based on the phenotypic characteristics. Recently, the first international consensus statement on diagnosis and management of CdLS introduced a tool for the diagnosis of the syndrome.cardinal features from suggestive characteristics. The former include synophrys and/or thick eyebrows, short nose, concave nasal ridge and/or upturned nasal tip, long and/or smooth philtrum, thin upper lip vermilion, and/or downturned corners of the mouth, hand oligodactyly and/or adactyly, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Suggestive features comprise global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, prenatal growth retardation, postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly (prenatally and/or postnatally), small hands, and/or feet, short fifth finger, and hirsutism. If present, each cardinal feature is scored with 2 points, whereas a score of 1 point is assigned to each suggestive feature. A total score ≥ of 11 points (with at least 3 are cardinal) indicates a classic CdLS; 9 or 10 points (at least 2 cardinal) is suggestive for a non-classic CdLS. Moreover, 4 to 8 points (at least 1 cardinal) requires molecular testing, whereas a score of fewer than 4 points is insufficient to indicate further exams.
