An ideal keratometer can measure the radius in various meridians from the axis of the cornea. The keratometers are designed to be rotated along a particular axis. The objects are labeled as mires. A double device has been incorporated to avoid errors and confusion due to the continuous movement of the eyes.

**Spherical Cornea**

This is characterized by no difference in power between the two principal meridians, and the mire appears as a perfect sphere.

**Astigmatism**

This is characterized by the difference in the power between the two principal meridians. As with the rule of astigmatism, horizontally oval mires are seen. As against the rule of astigmatism, vertically oval mires are seen. In oblique astigmatism, the principal meridian lies between 30 and 60 degrees and 120 and 150 degrees. The irregular anterior corneal surface has irregular mires and a doubling of mires.

**Keratoconus**

Inclination and jumping of mires are seen, also called pulsating mires. Minification of mires is seen in advanced keratoconus due to high myopia. Significant astigmatism shows oval mires. In advanced keratoconus, wavy, irregular, and distorted mires are also seen.
