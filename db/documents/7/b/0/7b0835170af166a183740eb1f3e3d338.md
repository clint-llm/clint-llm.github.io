Cisplatin is a medication used to manage and treat solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. It is in the alkylating agent class of cytotoxic medications. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for cisplatinum as a valuable agent in treating malignancy. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for the interprofessional oncology team members in the care of patients with malignancy treated with this agent.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of cisplatin.
- Describe the adverse effects associated with cisplatin therapy.
- Review the appropriate monitoring necessary with cisplatin therapy.
- Outline how collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team can enhance patient care when dosing and monitoring cisplatin to improve patient outcomes for patients receiving antineoplastic therapy with cisplatin.
