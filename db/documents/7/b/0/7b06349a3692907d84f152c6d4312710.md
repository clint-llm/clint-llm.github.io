Neuroimaging, in conjunction with physical examination findings, may be used to characterize the cause of hemianopsia and guide clinical management.

Patients with focal neurologic findings suggestive of stroke and within the window for intervention (chemical or mechanical thrombectomy) should receive prompt imaging per institutional protocols or the AHA Stroke Guidelines.

MRI of the brain best evaluates both bitemporal hemianopsia and homonymous hemianopsia with contrast. In the case of bitemporal hemianopsia, special attention should focus on the structure of the optic chiasm and sellar region. With homonymous hemianopsia, the retrochiasmal structures, including the optic tract and occipital lobe, should be well characterized.

Diffusion-weighted imaging is preferable for detecting vasogenic edema associated with acute ischemic changes. Note that CT may be employed in emergent scenarios to evaluate for ischemia, mass lesions, or vascular aneurysms. CT angiogram is helpful in the case of large vessel pathologies, such as a middle cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery occlusion.
