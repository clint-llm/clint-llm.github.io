The main goal of the prehospital ECG is to identify a STEMI more quickly, leading to a more timely intervention in the appropriate candidates. Several studies have shown that decreased FMC-to-device times have improved morbidity and mortality. An effective way of decreasing the time to PCI is activating the cardiac catheterization lab from the prehospital setting and bypassing the emergency department in qualified facilities. This is a large undertaking for any health system, requiring an interprofessional effort between the EMS services, emergency department staff, interventional cardiologist, and the CCL staff.  There have been some reservations about “false positive” ECGs from the field. The fear is that there will be an unnecessary utilization of resources involved with activating the CCL, as well as the possible iatrogenic injuries and adverse outcomes associated with the procedure itself.
