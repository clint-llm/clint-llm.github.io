Hepatic cysts are fluid-filled cavities in the liver generally asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging studies. They can sometimes be associated with serious complications such as infection, hemorrhage, rupture, or compression of the biliary tree. This activity explains the evaluation and treatment of hepatic cyst and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of hepatic cysts.
- Identify the use of CT, MRI, and an ultrasound in the evaluation of hepatic cysts.
- Describe the use of percutaneous aspiration, laparoscopic deroofing, and complete cyst excision in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic cysts.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients with hepatic cysts.
