Suture material placed in human tissue represents a foreign body, andÂ it will provoke an immunologic response. The tissue response depends on the suture material (absorbable versus non-absorbable, synthetic versus biologic), the type of tissue receiving sutures, and the immune system. Inherent properties of absorption, filament number, size, and tissue reactivity are among the features of suture material implicated in the tissue response. The response may be driven by the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system, or a combination thereof. The most frequently implicated agents are macrophages, which are responsible for the cell-mediated response, commonly referred to as type IV hypersensitivity reaction.

To explain suture hypersensitivity, what constitutes a normal tissue response to the presence of foreign material must be established. Sutures serve as a persistent, or even non-degradable, antigen, which elicits a macrophage-dominant reaction over weeks. Activated macrophages often engage in a morphologic change to epithelium-like cells, referred to as epithelioid cells or histiocytes. Granuloma formation constitutes the aggregation of the epithelioid cells, with surrounding lymphocytes. Such reactions are referred to as granulomatous inflammation, which is related to strong T-cell activation and cytokine production. This reaction can also be elicited by foreign bodies that activate macrophages without an adaptive immune response.

Absorbable sutures depend on the tissue response for their timely dissolution. Suture hypersensitivity is related to the duration of suture absorption, developing such a reaction at the end of the absorption process. The sutures' diameter might be critical in this process.

The tissue response elicited by suture material is a specific case of this generalized form of inflammation. The reaction can be broken down into acute and chronic phases. The acute response of tissues to suture is the same for all sutures during the first five to seven days, at least.

In contrast, non-absorbable sutures remain in tissues indefinitely and exhibit a different tissue reaction. Buried silk produces an initial prompt tissue reaction consisting of mild edema and a collection of polymorphonuclear leucocytes around the suture. By the third day, a few fibroblasts are seen, and the intensity of leukocyte infiltration starts to decrease. As the process continues, there is a gradual increase in monocytes, giant cells, and round cells and a decrease in polymorphonuclear cells. Fibroblasts penetrate between the silk fibers and eventually form a fibrous capsule around the suture material.

The reactions to silk may be divided into two major types. In the first and most frequent, the suture remains tight and is surrounded by a capsule of fibrous tissue with variable thickness. Also, it is accompanied by a layer of histiocytes from one to three cell layers deep. Giant cells and lymphocytes vary in both occurrence and numbers. In more cellular reactions, capillaries may be prominent. In the second type of response, the capsule is present, but fibroblasts and histiocytes invade the interstices of the suture. In rare instances, the response appears much like granuloma.

The extent of the tissue reaction also depends on the tissue receiving the suture material. Bladder lumen exposure with silk and mersilene sutures produced significant tissue reactions and stone formation. In comparison, with monofilament polypropylene sutures, this reaction wasn't present. Plain catgut produced the least tissue reaction.

The development of a foreign body granuloma may be associated with an immunoreaction of macrophages.
