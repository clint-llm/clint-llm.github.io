A Holter monitor is an ambulatory electrocardiographic system discovered by Dr. Norman J. Holter and his team in 1957. Little did they knew that their device would change the way we track cardiac rhythms out of the hospital.

Historically electrocardiography began in 1893 with the work of Einthoven's string galvanometer.

Since then it has formed the backbone of rhythm detection and analysis in Cardiac Electrophysiology.
