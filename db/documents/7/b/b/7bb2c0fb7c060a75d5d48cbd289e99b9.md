**Effects, Consequences, and Reactions of Sexual Harassment in Medicine**

Workplace sexual harassment, categorized as gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion, is considered a risk factor for women's mental health problems. Women who have encountered sexual harassment in their workplace report depression, anxiety, increased use of alcohol and drugs, and eating disorders. In addition, negative mood, self-blame, reduced self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, anger, disgust, envy, fear, and reduced satisfaction with life have also been demonstrated. Sexual harassment increases the risk of suicidal behavior and severe psychiatric illness.

Over the longer term, it is typical for women to become less trusting and more careful in developing professional connections and dealing with potential academic collaborators. Some women evade male mentors or permanently modify their interpersonal interactions with colleagues, which often harms professional relationships.
