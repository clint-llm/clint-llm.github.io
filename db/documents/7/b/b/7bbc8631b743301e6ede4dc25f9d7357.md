All that wheezes is not asthma, and it is essential to keep a broad differential while bronchiolitis/wheezing associated respiratory infections are the most common alternative diagnosis, many other disease processes present with wheezing.

Be wary of patients with a "normal" blood gas who appear to be experiencing significant respiratory distress and patients who appear lethargic or altered. They may be nearing respiratory failure and respiratory arrest with secondary cardiac arrest.

Patients requiring continuous nebulized treatments or interventions beyond albuterol, ipratropium, and steroids may have status asthmaticus. They require readmission for further evaluation and management.

Remember to look for both common triggers (URIs, allergens, exercise) and uncommon triggers (reflux, medications, psychological distress).
