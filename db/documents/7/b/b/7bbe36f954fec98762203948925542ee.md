Simulation offers the ability to demonstrate the safe and proficient performance of both basic and advanced procedural skill sets along with overall patient care performance outcomes utilizing cognitive, technical, and ergonomic factors.  To ensure these aspects are met, the simulation center must be able to not only capture this data but also have the ability to provide a reporting structure that allows both the learner and faculty the data demonstrating proficiency.  FERPA guidelines apply to all learners utilizing simulation centers in higher education; therefore, simulation center administrators, faculty, and staff must be knowledgeable of the guidelines that apply to their institution (FERPA 34 CFR § 99.3).

As simulation continues to evolve into the future with hybrid, in-situ, and virtual simulations, the various aspects of distance learning will bring about creative challenges for simulation centers to record and safeguard educational records.
