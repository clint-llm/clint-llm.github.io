Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) occurs in genetically susceptible individuals after an inappropriate immune response to the intestinal flora.

To date, the cause of IBD remains a mystery. Many causes have been implicated but none is universally present in all patients. The one consistent feature of Crohn disease is that it has a strong link with tobacco. On the other hand, it appears that smoking protects against ulcerative colitis. The role of diet remains debatable.

The CARD15 gene has been associated with IBD but because of its polymorphic features, it is not possible to determine which part of the GI tract will be affected. The role of genes in ulcerative colitis is not as strong as in Crohn disease.
