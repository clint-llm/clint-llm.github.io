This activity reviews the principles behind refractive errors in children and the effects these uncorrected errors have on ocular visual development. It looks at the special procedures, testing requirements, and instrumentation required to examine a child properly. Suppression and amblyopia affect the developing visual system due to uncorrected refractive error. The activity also highlights the role of the family and interprofessional team in the process of prescribing glasses for children and in proper management and follow-up.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the optical basis for refractive errors.
- Describe the progression of different types of refractive errors in children.
- Summarize the modified ocular examination techniques needed for children.
- Review several factors affecting prescribing glasses for children.
