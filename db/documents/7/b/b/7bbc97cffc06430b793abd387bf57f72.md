The goals of acromegaly treatment include controlling biochemical parameters (GH and IGF-1 levels) and associated signs and symptoms, the local mass effect of the tumor, managing comorbidities, and improving mortality.

**Surgical Therapy**

Surgery is the treatment of choice for all microadenomas as well as macroadenomas, causing a mass effect. Debulking of macroadenomas without mass effect can also be done and has been described as a modality to allow for better response to medical treatment, even if a surgical cure is not likely.

**Surgical Techniques**

- **Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery:**A minimally invasive surgery using an endoscope through a small incision in the nose or at the upper lip to remove the pituitary adenoma will promptly alleviate any pressure symptoms, as well as reduce the elevated growth hormone (GH) levels. The proposed benefit of using an endoscope is the enhanced ability to visualize the tumor in a panoramic fashion and not miss any residual tumor when resecting.

- **Transsphenoidal Microscopic Surgery:**The tumor is directly visualized using a microscope, which is the traditional method of transsphenoidal surgery. A meta-analysis compared endoscopic and traditional microscopic transsphenoidal surgeries. It found they have comparable endocrine remission and complication rates. As expected, microadenomas had higher remission rates regardless of the surgical technique used, and the endoscopic technique confers the theoretical benefit of better visualization and, thus, better outcomes for macroadenomas. But, further studies are required to directly compare these surgical modalities.

- **Craniotomy:**This approach is reserved for those adenomas with suprasellar extension. Other reasons for choosing this approach include unfavorable para-sellar sinuses and internal or external carotid artery aneurysms.

**Post-surgical Follow-up and Management**

Immediately post-surgery, urine output monitoring and sodium levels are vital. Patients may either develop the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or, conversely, diabetes insipidus and necessitate desmopressin administration. The adrenal function should be monitored and treated appropriately immediately post-operatively. Patients with comorbid sleep apnea should not use their CPAP device post-operatively for a while to reduce the risk of pneumocephalus and infections as a result of the high nasal pressures. Thyroid and gonadal axes can undergo testing 6 to 12 weeks after surgery. Studies have shown that immediate day-one post-operative measurement of GH can be done to assess remission. However, the remaining normal pituitary gland may produce excess GH in response to surgical stress.

An OGTT can be done one week post-operatively. A GH value of <0.4ng/mL defines disease control. Serology of GH and IGF-1 can be measured by 3 to 6 months post-operatively as it can take this long for IGF-1 levels to normalize. Remission is then defined when normal IGF-1 levels are seen, and GH after OGTT is measured at <1ng/mL (although some recommend using <0.4ng/mL). If remission is confirmed, serology should be repeated at least annually, as relapse has been known to occur in some patients even as long as ten or more years later. Post-operative imaging should be done a minimum of 3 months after surgery as the fat and gel foam packing can take that long to be resorbed.

If residual disease is noted, the patient may need further treatment with repeat surgery, if possible and appropriate, medical management or radiotherapy. Pathology specimens are helpful for further management and prognostication as, for example, when the tumor is densely granulated, this may predict response to octreotide.

**Medical Therapy**

This****is considered for patients who do not desire surgery, are too high risk for surgery, are not a surgical candidate as the tumor may be unresectable, and those with recurrent disease after initial surgical management who do not qualify for repeat surgery. As described above, there may also be a role for neoadjuvant medical therapy before surgery.

**Medical Agents**

- **Somatostatin analogs (octreotide, Lanreotide, pasireotide):**
- All of these drugs are synthetic somatostatin and bind to somatostatin receptors. This results in the suppression of growth hormone secretion from both normal pituitary gland and somatotroph adenomas; it also acts at the level of the liver inhibiting GH action by reducing GH binding to hepatocytes and reducing the production of IGF-1 from the liver. Thus, these drugs control hormonal overproduction as well as tumor growth.
- Also, Pasireotide is a second-generation somatostatin analog; it has been found to have a much higher affinity for the somatostatin receptor SSTR5 in addition to some action on SSTR2 and SSTR3. This is important as most somatotroph adenomas have high expression of both SSTR2 and SSTR5. Thus, with octreotide and lanreotide having effects predominantly via SSTR2 and pasireotide with the highest affinity for SSTR5, this can help with targeted therapy.
- Somatostatin analogs are usually administered as once-monthly intramuscular injections, although 3 to 4 times per day, subcutaneous injections are also available. Recently, an oral formulation of somatostatin has been FDA-approved. This came after the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial. The primary endpoint was control of IGF-1 levels, and they met primary endpoints. 58% of patients with acromegaly taking the oral formulation of octreotide had controlled levels of IGF-1 as opposed to only 19% of those taking a placebo.
- Somatostatin analogs are generally well tolerated. Side effects that have been reported are mainly gastrointestinal such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, but they can also result in biliary sludge or cholelithiasis. These drugs can also affect glucose homeostasis resulting in hyperglycemia; this result seems more pronounced with pasireotide.
- Concerning monitoring, an IGF-1 level should be measured three months after administering a long-acting somatostatin analog. Treatment efficacy is described as one or a combination of the following: random GH level <2ng/mL, GH nadir <1ng/mL after OGTT, or normalization of IGF-1 levels.

- **Dopamine receptor agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine):**
- These act on dopamine 2 receptors (D2R) in the pituitary gland and are less effective than somatostatin analogs. They are often used as adjuncts. Cabergoline is more potent than bromocriptine in lowering GH levels. Doses of cabergoline (up to 7mg weekly) are much higher than those used in prolactinomas to effectively reduce GH levels.
- These drugs are considered for those patients with only mild biochemical abnormalities (GH >1 but <1.3ng/mL) and mild symptoms or in conjunction with somatostatin analogs. Studies have shown that cabergoline can reduce GH and IGF-1 levels in 40% of patients.
- The most common side effects related to these drugs are nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, rarely dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension.

- **GH-Receptor antagonist (pegvisomant):**
- This novel drug is a human growth hormone analog and blocks endogenous growth hormone at the receptor level, lowering IGF-1 levels while GH levels can be increased.
- IGF-1 levels are the only biochemical marker used to monitor response to treatment.
- This drug does not have anti-proliferative effects and thus does not affect tumor size.
- Adverse reactions associated with this drug include diarrhea and nausea; it can also result in abnormal hepatic function tests, infections, and pain.
- Of note, pegvisomant can have a beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis and can improve insulin sensitivity.

Combination medical therapy has also been described. Combining cabergoline with a somatostatin analog has been seen to be effective in a subset of patients, even in the absence of hyperprolactinemia. Another common combination is that of a somatostatin analog with Pegvisomant. A study demonstrated that by adding Pegvisomant to a somatostatin analog in patients seemingly resistant to the somatostatin analog, IGF-1 levels normalized in 95% of patients. Importantly, if this combination is used, one needs to monitor hepatic function, as liver derangement is more common with the combination of drugs than with Pegvisomant alone.

A combination of a low-dose somatostatin analog with weekly pegvisomant is not an on-label or approved regimen for acromegaly; however, a study has shown promise for this novel dosing regimen to be effective in biochemical control in addition to being cost-effective in those requiring combination therapy for the management of their acromegaly.

**Radiotherapy**

Radiotherapy is considered in those patients in whom medical management is ineffective in controlling disease, recurrence after surgery, and, again, the failure of medical therapy. The patients treated with radiotherapy need to be closely monitored for hypopituitarism.

- **Conventional fractionated radiotherapy is often**administered as an adjunct to surgery to prevent relapse or when surgery cannot bring the acceptable lowering of GH levels. It is associated with the risk of irradiating adjacent brain tissues. It is provided at small daily doses five days a week, usually for 5 to 6 weeks duration. Remission can take up to 10 years, and these patients require medical management in the interim.

- **Stereotactic radiosurgery:**Precision radiotherapy directs high-dose radiation to the tumor and minimizes risk to nearby healthy brain tissues. It is a single high dose of radiation. The adenoma needs to be multiple millimeters away from the optic chasm to avoid damage to utilize this technique. The remission rate with this modality ranges from 17 to 50% in the absence of medical management for 2 to 5 years.

**Management of Acromegaly in Pregnancy**

GH secretion varies during normal pregnancy. GH-secreting tumors have estrogen receptors, particularly those that co-secrete prolactin. The concern is whether the pregnant state would increase the tumor size; however, in some studies, it has been found that tumor size does not change significantly during pregnancy in most women. But, given that the risk is still present, women need to be monitored closely with serial visual field monitoring.

In a pregnant patient with acromegaly due to a microadenoma, the clinician should discontinue medical management, and these patients can just be closely monitored. The same applies to those with macroadenomas not affecting the optic chiasm with very close monitoring of visual fields. If a woman were to develop worsening symptoms related to acromegaly, medical management could be reinstituted to help alleviate those symptoms (no biochemical monitoring due to alterations of IGF-1 and GH during pregnancy). Bromocriptine has been used in pregnant women with acromegaly to manage the signs and symptoms without causing adverse fetal harm. However, cabergoline has not been extensively studied in pregnancy. Somatostatin analogs can cross the placenta and potentially decrease uterine blood flow, but longer use of octreotide does not seem to adversely affect the pregnancy or fetal development. Pegvisomant is not recommended as it has not been studied in pregnancy, and its use in pregnancy is limited to case reports. If visual complaints arise, an MRI is necessary to determine whether medical management or surgery is needed.
