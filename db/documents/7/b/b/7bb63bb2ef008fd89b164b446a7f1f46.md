Any intracranial pathology which causes an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) can cause tonsillar herniation, particularly posterior fossa pathologies. These include:

- Hematoma:

- 
              
- Intracerebral (particularly cerebellar)
              
              
- Subdural
              
              
- Extradural
              
              
- Intraventricular

- Subarachnoid hemorrhage

- Posterior fossa space-occupying lesions:

- 
              
- Tumor
              
              
- Abscess

- Hydrocephalus

- Diffuse brain swelling:

- 
              
- Diffuse axonal injury
              
              
- Malignant middle cerebral artery stroke syndrome

- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) over drainage by lumbar puncture (LP)

Historically, LP was a more common cause of tonsillar herniation. If aÂ patient has raised ICP, then lowering the pressure within the spinal canal can increase the pressure gradient between the posterior fossa and the spinal canal, resulting in tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum. Before the advent of computed tomographic (CT) scan in the 1970s, patients with signs of raised intracranial pressure had "therapeutic lumbar taps," where a large volume of CSF was removed. In modern practice, if a patient is symptomatic with signs of raised ICP (headache, nausea, reduced consciousness, or focal neurological deficit), then intracranial imaging with CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated before LP. This allows an assessment as to whether it is safe or not to proceed with an LP.
