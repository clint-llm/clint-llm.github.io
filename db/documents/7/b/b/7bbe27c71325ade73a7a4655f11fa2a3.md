The various locoregional anesthesia techniques for breast reconstruction surgery are currently performed under ultrasound to minimize the risks of nerve damage and pneumothorax for certain nerve blocks and require the following equipment:

- Ultrasound guidance with theÂ high-frequency probe or low-frequency curvilinear probe, depending on the depth of the block and the patient's body

- Sterile sleeve and gel

- One 23 to 25-gauge needle for skin infiltration

- 20 mL of local anesthetic

- Needle size: 80mm B-bevel nerve block needle

- One pack of gauze 4-inch x 4-inch

- Chlorhexidine gluconate solution for skin asepsis

- Sterile gloves

- Marking pen
