Complications of NIPPV include patient discomfort, anxiety, and agitation, pulmonary barotrauma (ie pneumothorax), hypotension (secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure and reduced preload) gastric distention (usually with elevated inspiratory positive airway pressure greater than 20 cm water) leading to abdominal compartment syndrome. Most of these problems can be alleviated by using the lowest, safest setting that provides results. Hypotension can be treated with either administration of intravenous (IV) fluids.
