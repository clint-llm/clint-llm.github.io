Pulmonary veins have clinical significance in two ways predominantly, congestion or anatomical malformation. Congestion occurs secondary to left-sided heart failure. Pulmonary edema that arises from pulmonary vein congestion gives rise to the respiratory symptoms with which most patients with congestive heart failure present.

Anatomical malformation such as partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) and the more severe form, total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR).

Another disease associated with abnormal veins is alveolar-capillary dysplasia with misaligned pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV). This rare and fatal disease (almost 100% mortality) is caused by unknown teratogen, which hinders the development of fetal lung vascularization.Â Significant decrease in alveolar capillary numbers causing the blood that enters individual lung unit to drain to this abnormal vein directly rather than from capillaries.

To visualize the pulmonary veins, several radiographic modalities can be used, such as chest radiography, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography (CT). Multidetector CT Scan is considered the best imaging modality for pulmonary veins evaluation.

Agenesis of the right pulmonary veins is a very rare event. This condition involves the presence of collateral veins but less oxygenated blood.
