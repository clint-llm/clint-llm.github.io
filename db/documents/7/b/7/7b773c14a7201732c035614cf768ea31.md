Given the variable presentation of SSPE and the clinical findings it is associated with, there are many other differential diagnoses to think of. Although SSPE generally occurs in childhood, it can rarely occur in adults and should not be dismissed if the patient is a pregnant woman. It can be misdiagnosed as sole epilepsy or psychiatric illness in the early stages of the disease. Any patients with acute, progressive myoclonus, dementia, and/or seizures should be evaluated for the following:

- Viral encephalitis

- Autoimmune encephalitis

- Atypical multiple sclerosis

- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

- NMDA receptor encephalitis

- Neurometabolic encephalopathies

- Neoplasms

- Paraneoplastic syndromes

- Leukodystrophies

By no means is this list completely inclusive, but it speaks to a vast realm of possibilities that should be considered in addition to SSPE.
