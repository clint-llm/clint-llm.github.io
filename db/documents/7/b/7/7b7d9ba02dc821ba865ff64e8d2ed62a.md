The lower leg consists of four compartments: anterior, lateral, superficial posterior, and deep posterior.

- The anterior compartment includes the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus tertius, tibialis anterior and the deep peroneal nerve

- The lateral compartment contains the peroneus longus and brevis and also the superficial peroneal nerve

- The deep posterior compartment consists of the tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorum longus, popliteus, and the tibialis nerve

- The popliteus muscle solely acts at the knee by internally rotating the tibia relative to the femur, thus its function is to "unlock" the knee joint during the initiation of flexion

- The popliteus is located behind the knee joint and forms the base of the popliteal fossa


- The tibialis posterior is the deepest of the four muscles and originates from the interosseous membrane between the tibia and fibula. It inverts and plantar flexes the foot and maintains the medial arch of the foot. The flexor digitorium longus (FDL) is located medially in the posterior leg and is responsible for flexing the lateral four toes. The flexor hallucis longus is located on the lateral side of the leg and flexes the great toe

- The superficial posterior compartment has the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, and the sural nerve

- The tibial nerve innervates all of the superficial and deep muscles of the calf.
