The sphenopalatine artery is a terminal branch of the internal maxillary artery originating from the external carotid artery system.

The SPA branches into two major vessels, the septal artery and posterior lateral nasal artery, before exiting the sphenopalatine foramen.

The sphenopalatine artery and its branches form an anastomotic region within the nasal cavity. Kiesselbach's plexus (Little's area) is the arterial anastomosis found in the anterior nasal septum formed by terminal branches of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the external carotid artery (ECA). The Kiesselbach's plexus is formed by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal artery (branches of the ICA) and ECA branches such as the superior labial artery, greater palatine artery, and the posterior septal branch of the SPA.
