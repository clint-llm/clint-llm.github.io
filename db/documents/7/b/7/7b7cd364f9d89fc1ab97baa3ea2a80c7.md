**Simple, Superficial Eyelid Laceration Repair**

Reapproximate skin edges with simple interrupted sutures using 6-0 silk or 6-0 plain gut suture. Be sure to evert the skin edges. Take small bites (approximately 1 mm from the skin edge) and space sutures 2 mm to 3 mm apart. Avoid tightly tying sutures to the skin. Tight sutures can strangulate delicate tissue. The silk suture will need to be removed. The plain gut suture is absorbable and is preferred if the patient is not reliable to follow-up for suture removal.

**Eyelid Margin Involving Laceration**

Many techniques are commonly employed to approximate the edges of an eyelid margin laceration.

- Using 6-0 Silk suture, re-approximate the edges of the eyelid margin by placing one simple interrupted suture from gray line to gray line. Do not tie the suture. See Image 2a.

- Then, place partial-thickness simple interrupted sutures using 6-0 Vicryl to approximate the edges of the tarsal plate. Tie these sutures and cut the ends short. This is important for the structural integrity of the eyelid.

- Place an additional marginal 6-0 silk suture parallel to the first but closer to the lash line.

- Suture skin as described above.

**Eyelid Laceration with Canalicular Involvement**

Dilate both upper and lower puncta. If there is an un-involved punctum, probe it to the sac and irrigate to ensure there are no underlying blockages. Then identify the medial and lateral ends of the lacerated canaliculus. A miniaturized stent can be used if only one canaliculus is involved. If both are involved, silicone tubing or a Crawford stent can be used. See below for stenting techniques for miniature and Crawford Stent. Suture skin as described above in simple laceration repair.

Miniature stent: Advance a stent through the punctum of the lacerated canaliculus and out the distal end. Then insert a stent into the canaliculus opening of the lacerated lateral edge. Ensure the stent is seated in the punctum. Place several 6-0 polyglactin sutures using a curved needle to anastomose the cut edges of the canaliculus and re-approximate the surrounding tissue. Leave these untied. Then place addition interrupted buried 5-0 polyglactin sutures to reinforce the medial canthal tendon. After all deep sutures are placed, tie and trim all sutures.

Crawford Stent: Place the first end of the stent through the punctum of the lacerated canaliculus and out the distal end. Then pass the same end through the previously identified proximal end and then advance through the lacrimal and nasal lacrimal duct. Retrieve the end of the stent from the nasal cavity. Pass the other end of the stent similarly through the intact canaliculus. Tie and trim ends in the nose just before skin closure.
