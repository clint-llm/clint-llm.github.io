Chondrosarcoma is ideally managed by an interprofessional team that consists of orthopedists, radiologists, surgical oncologists, oncologists, pathologists, and specialty care nurses. Correlation between gross, radiographic, and microscopic features of the lesion is crucial to establish the definitive diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. Postoperatively, patients require long term follow-up due to the possibility of tumor recurrence and distant metastases. The prognosis for patients with low-grade disease is excellent. Pharmacists review medications, check for drug-drug interactions, and provide patient education. Specialty care nurses in perianesthesia, operating room, orthopedics, and oncology are involved in monitoring patients, educating patients and their families, and providing updates to the team about the patient's condition. Thereby the team can improve outcomes for this condition. [Level 5]
