Patients should undergo pre-operative risk stratification before any major surgery, including latissimus dorsi flap transfer. Patients should be screened for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases that may increase the risks of general endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-operative imaging of the harvest and inset sites is not required for latissimus transfer. Blood loss from surgery can be significant, however, so a type-and-screen should be performed to prepare for the possibility of transfusion. Finally, patients' nutrition, electrolyte levels, thyroid hormone levels, and other wound healing predictors should be checked and optimized before reconstructive surgery is performed.
