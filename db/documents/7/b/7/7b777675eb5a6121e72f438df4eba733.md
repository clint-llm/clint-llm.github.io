Acute angle-closure glaucoma (ACG): This entity can be confused with PMG or PLG. Eliciting a positive family history for glaucoma and history of past similar episodes helps differentiate them. Gonioscopy of the contralateral eye helps distinguish the exact mechanism.

Ciliary block glaucoma (CBG): Malignant glaucoma or aqueous misdirection syndrome occurs due to anterior rotation of the ciliary body and accumulation of aqueous behind the anterior hyaloid. PBG is a commonly confused entity. Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is diagnostic as it provides relief of the PBG attack, while no lowering of the IOP occurs in CBG.

Supra-choroidal hemorrhage: It can mimic PBG with a flat AC and raised IOP. A detailed fundus evaluation shows a classic dark red elevation or, in cases of poor view of the fundus, B-scan ultrasound can be performed to aid in the diagnosis.

Choroidal effusion: This condition classically presents with a low IOP. If the effusion involves a ciliary body and secondary cyclodialysis, it can present with raised IOP and a flat AC, mimicking PBG.

Post-traumatic endophthalmitis: The presence of a hypopyon, elevated IOP, corneal edema, or AC flare with a ruptured lens can mimic or coexist with PAG. A microbiological evaluation of the anterior chamber or vitreous tap helps exclude endophthalmitis.
