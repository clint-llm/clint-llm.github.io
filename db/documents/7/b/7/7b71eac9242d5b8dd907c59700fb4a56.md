Asteatotic eczema, also known as eczema craquel√©, is a common type of pruritic dermatitis. It can also be known as xerosis, which is dry skin. It characterized by dry, cracked, and scaling skin that is typically inflamed. It usually begins as dry skin, and as the disease becomes more severe, the skin can crack and cause fissures. These fissures are a result of epidermal water loss. The fissured skin occurs in a polygonal or curvilinear pattern. The irregular fissuring and scaling patterns are sometimes referred to as "crazing paving." Patients also report pruritis associated with dry skin.

Asteatotic eczema occurs especially in winter months when the skin is more at risk for becoming dry. Asteatotic eczema is also more common in the elderly. The eruption can occur on any skin area but typically presents on the anterolateral aspects of the lower legs. Lesions can also occur on the back, trunk, and arms.

There have been several case reports of asteatotic eczema correlating with underlying systemic conditions. These included malignancy, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition. Several classes of medications also have demonstrated links to xerosis, including diuretics, retinoids, and antineoplastics agents.
