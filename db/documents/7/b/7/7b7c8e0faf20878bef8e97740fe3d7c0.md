Conservative management of femoral pseudoaneurysms has higher rates of failure in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy, but not for those receiving thrombin injection.

Though not studied well, endovascular repair of visceral pseudoaneurysm carries a high rate of technical success in small series.  Open repair/ligation is considered more durable, however, and may be a better option for younger patients.

Traumatic aortic pseudoaneurysms treated via TEVAR have an excellent technical success rate (100%) with a low rate of device-related complications (2.4%) and conversion to open (2.4%).  Coverage of the left subclavian artery resulted in a 6% rate of delayed revascularization.
