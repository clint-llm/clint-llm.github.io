In a 2019 study of 2,175 patients published by Chen et al., infection was the most common complication, affecting 2.9% of patients. Postoperative bleeding was the second most common complication, occurring in 1.4% of patients.

Patients who use tobacco, have hypothyroidism or hypertension or also undergo auricular cartilage grafting or additional adjacent tissue transfer are more likely to require overnight admission, and patients with postoperative bleeding, neurological disorders, or alcohol use disorder are more likely to return to the emergency room or be readmitted to the hospital within 48 hours of surgery.
