The incidence of TGA is about 5.2-10/100,000 per year in the general population. In individuals aged 50 and older, the incidence increases to 23.5 to 32/100,000 per year. The majority of reported cases have been in patients aged 50 to 80 years old. There is no gender difference. Although no clear risk factors have been identified, it has been noted more often in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease and hyperlipidemia. There was not an associated history of prior ischemic stroke, diabetes, or hypertension noted. Many studies have demonstrated associated migraines in these patients, but this has not been demonstrated in all cases.
