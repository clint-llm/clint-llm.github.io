The patient is prepared by undergoing a complete physical examination with possible lab tests. Psychiatric evaluation is done to discuss their symptoms of depression, with the antidepressant medication trials they have earlier used. It helps in determining if rTMS would make a good treatment option for them. The physician should ask the patient for any personal/family history of epilepsy or any other mental health disorder such as substance abuse, bipolar disorder, or psychosis. Studies have shown that the patient should be enquired for any metal or implanted medical devices such as stents, aneurysm clips, implanted deep brain stimulators, implanted electrical devices such as pacemakers, cochlear implants for hearing, or any magnetic implants due to the strong magnetic field produced during the procedure.
