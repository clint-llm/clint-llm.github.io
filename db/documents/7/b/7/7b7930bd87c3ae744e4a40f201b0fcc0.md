Forceps allow for an alternative to vacuum-assisted delivery or cesarean section particularly with a non-reassuring tracing when delivery is imminent, maternal exhaustion from pushing, or medical comorbidities that preclude pushing or operative delivery. Advantages of forceps as compared to vacuum include:

- Unlikely to detach from head

- Can be used in premature fetuses

- Allows rotation

- Less bleeding from the scalp

- Less encephalopathy

In general, vacuum extraction is safer than forceps for the mother while forceps is safer than vacuum extraction for the fetus.
