Paget disease is a skeletal growth disorder in which abnormalities such as unusual bone growth can occur in several multifactoral ways. This is often manifested by diffuse pain throughout the musculoskeletal system. It generally manifests with radiologically visible changes. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of Paget disease and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the hypothesized etiologies of Paget disease.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with Paget disease including exam findings, indicated laboratory and diagnostic imaging.
- Summarize the treatment options for Paget disease.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by Paget disease.
