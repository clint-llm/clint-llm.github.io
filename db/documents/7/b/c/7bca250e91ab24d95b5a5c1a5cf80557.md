The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is a flat band of connective tissue that runs from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial condyle of the tibia. Its role is to provide valgus stability to the knee joint.Â MCL injuries often occur in sports, especially in skiing; in fact, 60% of skiing knee injuries involve the MCL.
