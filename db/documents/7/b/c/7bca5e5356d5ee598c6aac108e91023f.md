A detailed clinical history regarding the onset and duration of symptoms, travel history, exposure to people with COVID-19, underlying medical comorbidities, medication history must be obtained by treating providers. Patients with typical clinical signs suspicious of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, malaise, and myalgias should be tested for SARS-CoV-2.

Patients presenting with isolated GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain or incidental findings of elevated serum transaminases should be tested for virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting

Infectious etiology, especially C. difficile and other viral and bacterial enteric infections, should be ruled out in patients presenting with isolated symptoms of acute diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Patients with underlying chronic liver disease, on chronic immunosuppressive medications, and post-transplant patients presenting with atypical symptoms should also be considered for testing for SARS-CoV-2

Initial laboratory assessment with complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic panel(CMP) that includes testing for renal and liver function, coagulation panel, serum lipase should be considered at presentation.

Consider checking troponin and EKG to rule out cardiac injury, especially in patients presenting with liver abnormalities with AST>ALT.

Measuring inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin-dimer, and ferritin measurement can be considered.

Initial imaging may include chest x-ray, ultrasound, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography if clinically indicated.

Endoscopic evaluation should be considered if clinically indicated with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as recommended by The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), considering that endoscopy procedures are associated with a high risk of virus transmission.

Patient's with COVID-19 and elevated liver biochemistries should be checked for etiologies unrelated to COVID-19, which must include checking a comprehensive hepatitis panel to rule out other viruses such as hepatitis A, B, and C

In patients with Autoimmune Hepatitis(AIH) and Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT) recipients with active COVID-19, It is not recommended to presume disease flare or acute cellular rejection without a biopsy confirmation indicating the same
