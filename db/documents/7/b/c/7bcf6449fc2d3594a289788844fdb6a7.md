The only personnel requirement is someone authorized to perform the procedure within their scope of practice. Only one provider is necessary; however, a second person can assist by managing instruments, holding the tube while it is being secured, and retracting redundant soft tissue or breast tissue. Moderate sedation can be used, which would require a dedicated nurse or second provider to monitor the airway.
