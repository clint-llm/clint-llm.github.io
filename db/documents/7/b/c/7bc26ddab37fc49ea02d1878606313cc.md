Mean survival in HAD without ART is 3 to 6 months. This increased to 38.5 months with the initiation of ART therapy in the 1990s and it is thought that with adherence to HAART, mean survival should approach that of the general HIV-affected population. Worse prognosis is associated with the following factors: lower educational level, increasing age, lower CD4 count, higher viral load, decreasing hemoglobin, decreasing platelets, lower body mass index, hepatitis C coinfection, intravenous drug use and poor medication adherence. In addition, the presence of HAD is an independent predictor of risk of death in HIV-infected patients.
