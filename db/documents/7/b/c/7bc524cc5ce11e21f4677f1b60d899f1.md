Disulfiram is available only via oral administration. Tablets are available in 250 mg to 500 mg forms. Tablets may be crushed and mixed with liquids (water, coffee, milk, fruit juice) and should be taken once per day. Disulfiram administration should never take place until the patient has abstained from alcohol for at least 12 hours. Patients should avoid alcohol and alcohol-containing products for at least 14 days after discontinuing disulfiram, as there are reports of disulfiram-alcohol reactions within 2 weeks of discontinuation. There is no benefit to increasing the dose of disulfiram to greater than 500 mg/day.

A trial of disulfiram and alcohol to produce a disulfiram-alcohol reaction is no longer a recommendation. However, the patient should receive extensive education on symptoms of disulfiram-alcohol reaction before administration.
