Patients with uric acid calculi show similar clinical presentations as patients with calcium stones. However, uric acid calculi have a different mechanism of stone formation, radiological diagnosis is more problematic, and management modalities are different.

Patients should be educated on the various factors related to the prevention of uric acid nephrolithiasis like adequate fluid intake and dietary control. Adherence to medications also plays a vital role in the management of uric acid nephrolithiasis.
