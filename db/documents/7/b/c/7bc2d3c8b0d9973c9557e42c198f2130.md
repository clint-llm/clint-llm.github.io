These ten disorders are further categorized into three clusters – clusters A, B, and C. Cluster A contains paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal. Cluster B consists of antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders. And cluster C includes avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Personality disorders can be described as chronic life-long maladaptive behavior patterns that are inflexible and pervasive, infiltrating all aspects of an individual’s life. Of salience for this review will be avoidant personality disorder (AVPD). AVPD was first introduced in the psychiatric nosology in DSM III in 1980. It is associated with an overly sensitive hyper-vigilant temperament, with a general longing to relate to others.
