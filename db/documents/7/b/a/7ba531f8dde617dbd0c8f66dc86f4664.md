Acoustic neuromas are tumors that develop from the sheath of Schwann cells. They tend to occupy the cerebellopontine angle and are usually found adjacent to the cochlear or vestibular nerve, either intracranially or extra-axially. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of acoustic neuromas, and highlights the collaboration amongst the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology associated with acoustic neuromas.
- Describe some of the signs and symptoms that a patient with an acoustic neuroma may demonstrate.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for patients with acoustic neuromas.
- Explain how the interprofessional team collaborates to coordinate care effectively when evaluating and managing a patient with an acoustic neuroma.
