# Continuing Education Activity

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be distinguished from secondary osteonecrosis of the knee by its insidious onset and lack of identifiable cause. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK). This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in effectively diagnosing and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK).
- Review the evaluation of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK).
- Outline the treatment and management options available for patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK).
- Describe how interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication can advance the management of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

First described in 1968, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) is a distinct clinical entity that is a common cause of acute, unilateral knee pain and swelling.

# Etiology

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be distinguished from secondary osteonecrosis of the knee by its insidious onset and lack of identifiable cause.

In 2019, Hussain et al. published a systematic review re-examining the proposed etiologies of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee to understand the pathogenesis of the disease better. Here, the investigators noted a strong association between meniscal tears and spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee.  Meniscal tears were found to occur in 50 to 100% of patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee in the included studies, with the extent of medial meniscus extrusion correlating to the stage and volume of SONK lesions.

# Epidemiology

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is the most common form of knee osteonecrosis.

# History and Physical

Typically, the patient presents with acute onset, unilateral knee pain. The pain is severe and often localizes to the medial side of the joint, with lesions of the medial femoral condyle being most common. Notable history of trauma is usually absent; however, patients can sometimes recall precisely when the symptoms began.

# Evaluation

Evaluation of patients with suspected spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee begins with obtaining a comprehensive history and performing a physical exam. After this initial evaluation, further imaging is the next step. Anteroposterior (AP), oblique, and lateral plain films of the knee should be obtained and can demonstrate flattening of the involved condyles in later stages of the disease. It is important to note that plain radiographs are often negative early on in the course of the disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is especially useful in the early stages of the disease, given its high sensitivity to detect bone edema.

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be staged to assess the severity and to guide treatment. The Koshino classification, described in 1979, consists of four stages. Stage I is a patient with knee symptoms but normal x-ray findings. Stage II consists of patients with flattening and subchondral radiolucencies without collapse. Stage III shows an extension of these radiolucencies with subchondral collapse. Stage IV consists of further degenerative changes with osteosclerosis and osteophyte formation.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is guided based on the extent and severity of the disease. In the initial stages of the disease, non-operative treatment is an option, especially if the lesion is small (less than 3.5 centimeters squared).

Prior to subchondral collapse, joint-preserving surgical techniques can be employed, including diagnostic and therapeutic arthroscopy, core decompression, and osteochondral autologous transplants. Duany et al. reported an 87% success rate in preserving the native knee joint using such joint preserving surgical techniques in patients with pre-collapse SONK at a mean follow-up of 40 months.

Advanced stages of the disease can have treatment with a high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). HTO is usually the choice for younger, more active patients. Depending on lesion characteristics and the condition of the overall joint, UKA can be an attempt to maintain bone stock and native knee kinematics.

# Differential Diagnosis

The diagnosis of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be challenging due to the insidious onset of disease and nonspecific symptoms. Care is necessary to rule out both referred pain from concurrent hip disease as well as intra-articular pathology.

# Prognosis

Few studies exist which examine the natural course and downstream consequences of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee. Previous work has suggested that the prognosis for the condition does indeed depend on the size of the lesion, with larger lesions portending an increased risk of osteoarthritis.

# Complications

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is a progressive disease, and the patient’s condition will continue to deteriorate if not diagnosed and treated promptly. If diagnosed and treated conservatively in the early stages of the disease, patients can avoid risks and subsequent complications inherent in surgery.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should receive education on the disease progression and myriad of surgical options available. Compliance with conservative treatment measures is essential in preventing further subchondral collapse. Patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee should follow up closely with an orthopedic surgeon to monitor for disease progression.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is a relatively rare condition that necessitates a high index of suspicion when evaluating the undifferentiated patient with a focally tender knee. The majority of patients may present to the primary care provider or the emergency department. Thus, these clinicians, including nurses, need to know about SONK-delays in diagnosis, and erroneous treatment can lead to significant disability. The radiologist should be asked to perform the relevant imaging. If SONK is suspected, it is critical that the primary care physician and nurse institute the proper workup and makes a referral to an orthopedic surgeon if indicated. An orthopedic specialty-trained nurse can be an asset in these cases, by verifying patient compliance with medical therapy and assisting on surgical interventions. They would also help counsel the patient on the condition, and assist with post-surgical assessment as well. All these specialties working collaboratively demonstrate how an interprofessional team approach towards diagnosis and management of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee will drive the best patient outcomes regardless of the disease stage.
