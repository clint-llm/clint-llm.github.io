Complications of subclavian venous access can often be avoided with proper technique.

**Immediate Complications**

Immediate complications occur either during or immediately following central line insertion. They are classified into cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, and catheter placement complications.

**Cardiac complications**

Cardiac complications are one of the immediate complications which occur during subclavian line placement. Most common is the onset of arrhythmias (premature atrial and ventricular contractions) which occur when guidewire comes in contact with the right atrium.

**Vascular complications**

The vascular complications encountered during subclavian line placement are arterial injury, bleeding, venous injury, and hematoma formation.

**Catheter placement complications**

There are many case reports of guidewire and catheter entanglement with the IVC filters which were corrected by taking the help of fluoroscopy.

**Pulmonary complications:**

Subclavian line placement may be associated with pneumothorax, chylothorax, pneumomediastinum, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, tracheal injury, and air embolism.

**The Delayed Complications**

Infection and device dysfunction are the delayed complication of central line placements.

**Infections:**it can lead to sepsis, shock, and death.  It is mainly due to biofilm formation on the catheter with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the most commonly isolated organism.

**Device dysfunction:**dysfunction of components of the central venous catheter can lead to the development of delayed complications like catheter blockade due to fibrin sheath formation, catheter fracture, venous thrombosis, stenosis, and infection.  Fibrin sheath formation usually occurs within the first week of central line placement and they usually block the distal opening of the catheter. It is usually managed by fibrinolytic like alteplase and sometimes, line stripping is used when fibrinolytic fail to dissolve the fibrin sheath.
