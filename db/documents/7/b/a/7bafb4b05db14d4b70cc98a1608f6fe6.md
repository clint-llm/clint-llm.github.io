Most all CRC will present either by diagnostic colonoscopy for suspicious signs and symptoms (80%), asymptomatic, routine screening (11%), or incidental finding at an acute abdomen emergent admission (7%). Patients diagnosed through routine cancer screening are frequently at an earlier stage compared to the advanced disease seen in incidental surgical findings. Diagnostic colonoscopy’s triggers are blood per rectum (37%), abdominal pain (34%), and anemia (23%). The most common indications of emergent surgery are obstruction (57%), peritonitis (25%), and perforation (18%).

Symptoms according to tumor location on the clinical presentation of rectosigmoid are more frequently associated with a change in bowel habits (diminish stool caliber), bright red blood per rectum (hematochezia), pain (tenesmus), leakage diarrhea (mucus discharge), and constipation (obstruction). Late symptomatic presentation of metastatic disease at diagnosis will depend on the affected organ according to the dissemination route. Physical examination should explore signs of ascites, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy and must extend to a digital rectal exam for fixed mass. A thorough family history is of great relevance in identifying familial clusters and inherited patterns that would change the surveillance and therapy of a high-risk patient.
