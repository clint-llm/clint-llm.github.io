Natural killer or NK cells are a sub-population of Large Granular Lymphocytes (LGLs) which arise from a common NK/T-cell progenitor. Accumulating evidence indicates that NK cells can develop and mature both in the bone marrow and secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) including tonsils, spleen, and Lymph nodes (LNs)

While encountering normal cells, inhibitory receptors override activating receptors. However, molecular changes on the cell surface due to viral infection or tumor formation can stimulate the activating receptors. Upon activation, NK cells release granzyme, perforin, effector molecules of the TNF family, and Fas-ligand to induce apoptosis of the target cells. In addition, NK cells synthesize and release other cytokines and chemokines such as Il-10, gamma-interferon, GM-CSF to recruit other immune effector cells to the target site. NK cells also exhibit antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity against cells or target antigens which are marked with specific antibodies. Recently, therapeutic applications modulating the inhibition-activation dynamic of NK cells have been developed for multiple conditions including cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, etc.
