The preferred choice for oral vitamin K supplementation is vitamin K1. The suggested dose is 1 to 2 mg. In cases of severe coagulopathy (i.e., high INR), an oral dose of 5 to 10 mg can be administered. The maximum oral dose is 25 mg. Alternatively, vitamin K1 can be given intravenously. The dose for intravenous administration is 10 to 20 mg. It should be given slowly (no less than 30 min). The effect usually occurs within 2 to 4 hours after administering an intravenous dose. The maximum effect for intravenous administration is 6 to 12 hours, while oral supplementation will take about 24 hours.
