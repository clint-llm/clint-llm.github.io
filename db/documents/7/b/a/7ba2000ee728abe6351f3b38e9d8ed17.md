Ropinirole can cause death when taken with alcohol, and persons who excessively consume alcohol should not use the drug. A lethal level up to six times the therapeutic dose correlates with death.

Patients with liver insufficiency require close monitoring; a report of a case of liver toxicity exists. The medication is metabolized majorly in the liver, and the toxicity may be due to an immune reaction or a possible toxic metabolite of the drug.

There have been reports of patients who intentionally or accidentally took more than the maximum recommended daily dose of ropinirole in clinical trials. General supportive measures are recommended, and vitals should be maintained when necessary. The largest overdose reported with ropinirole in clinical trials was 62 mg daily for seven days (total 435 mg). Of these patients who used doses higher than 24 mg per day, commonly reported adverse reactions were related to its dopaminergic activity, i.e., nausea, dizziness, hyperhidrosis, visual hallucinations, claustrophobia, palpitations, chorea, asthenia, and nightmares. Additional symptoms reported in overdose patients included vomiting, agitation, chest pain, increased coughing, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, dyskinesia, somnolence, and confusional state.
