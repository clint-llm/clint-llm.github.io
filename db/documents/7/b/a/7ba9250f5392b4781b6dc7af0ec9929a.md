Hypothalamic hamartomas are benign congenital tumors that arise from the ventral hypothalamus.

The intrahypothalamic subtype of hypothalamic hamartoma, in particular, is also associated with neurobehavioral comorbidity, including cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms.

Psychiatric symptoms are a common comorbid feature of hypothalamic hamartoma with epilepsy.
