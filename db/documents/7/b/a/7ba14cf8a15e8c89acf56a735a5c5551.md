If not diagnosed on time, these patients can lead to potentially serious complications. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of MGS and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of MGS.
- Summarize the evaluation process of MGS.
- Review the differential diagnoses of MGS.
- Explain the management of patients with MGS.
