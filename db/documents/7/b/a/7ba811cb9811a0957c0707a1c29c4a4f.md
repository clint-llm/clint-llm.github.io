Pulmonary hypertension presents with nonspecific and progressive symptoms, which require a high degree of suspicion to make a timely diagnosis. Without treatment, PH and pulmonary arterial hypertension are progressive and fatal diseases. Risk stratification in patients with risk factors for this disease helps guide diagnostic studies and leads to improved clinical outcomes with early diagnosis.

Risk stratification also determines the initial treatment regimen and helps in monitoring disease progression and response to therapy. As described above, PAH represents an imbalance between vasoconstrictors and proliferative mediators (e.g., endothelin-1) and vasodilators (e.g., nitric oxide, prostacyclin).

Following guideline-recommended diagnostic algorithms and treatment regimens has helped achieve this improvement. Emerging treatments and ongoing clinical trials continue to expand treatment options for patients with refractory disease or those who cannot receive available therapies. As a result, the prognosis of PAH with treatment is improving compared to other forms of PH. In the Giessen Pulmonary Hypertension Registry, patients with chronic lung disease associated-PH (group 3) had worse survival compared with PAH, and patients with group 2 PH had similar survival rates to those with PAH.
