When a primary caregiver or nurse practitioner comes across a patient with a movement disorder, referral to a neurologist is recommended as the differential diagnosis is broad and the treatments doÂ vary for each disorder. The interprofessional team may consist of a neurologist, neurosurgeon, neuroscience nurse, and a pharmacist. The nurse can monitor patient response, provide education, and keep the team apprised of changes in patient status. The pharmacist should educate the patient about medication use, compliance, and side effects. The best outcomes will be achieved with a team approach. [Level 5]
