**Diagnosis of TBM**

CNS-TB is a paucibacillary disease; therefore, it eludes a definite diagnosis.

Confirmatory evidence of demonstrating MTB in CSF is challenging, so newer molecular techniques are very useful. However, diagnostic confirmation may not be possible in every case, so presumptive and early initiation of treatment should be done to prevent delay-related morbidity and mortality.

It is important to explore the epidemiological variables and various personal risk factors for acquiring infection, although this data may not always be forthcoming in adults. In children with TBM, however, exposure to active TB could be elicited in 70-90%.

An extra-neural site of active infection may help make presumptive diagnoses in some cases. Chest radiographs may be valuable in most children with TBM and about 50% of adults. A laboratory workup may suggest mild anemia, lymphocytosis, and hyponatremia. A positive tuberculin test is useful as supportive evidence, especially in children; however, a negative cannot exclude the diagnosis. Fundus examination is worthwhile as it may reveal papilloedema and choroid tubercles.

**CSF Examination and Culture**

A pellicle or cobweb may form during gross CSF examination, which is representative but not pathognomonic of TBM. A xanthochromic CSF indicates a very high protein content. CSF cytological analysis typically shows the total cell count between 100 and 500/mm^3 in the majority. In 15% of cases, <100 cells/mm^3 are present; pleocytosis may be absent in miliary TB with CNS-TB, elderly, and coinfection with HIV.

In 20% of cases, the cell number may be 500 to 1,500 cells/mm^3. Also, in the first week of illness, a transient polymorphonuclear predominance may be observed, or there may be mixed pleocytosis; however, typically, the CSF picture in TBM is that of predominant lympho-mononuclear pleocytosis.

Value exceeding one g/dl is characteristic of severe adhesive spinal arachnoiditis and portends a poor prognosis. The glucose level in CSF is <45 mg/dl in 80% of cases; however, unlike acute pyogenic meningitis, CSF glucose is never undetectable.

**Microbiological Tests**

Demonstration of MTB in the CSF smear by Ziehl-Neelsen and Auramine-rhodamine staining is crucial but elusive.

**Molecular Diagnostic Techniques**

Based upon the recommendations of the World Health Organization, Xpert MTB/RIF, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, is used for molecular diagnosis in CSF specimens in TBM, especially in volume constraint scenarios.

A meta-analysis of Xpert MTB/RIF demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 80.5% and 97.8%, respectively.

The sensitivity of CSF assays for mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is comparable to Xpert MTB/RIF, and it may be useful for the diagnosis of TBM in HIV-infected patients, especially in resource-poor settings.

**Adenosine Deaminase**

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme produced by T-lymphocytes. It is an indirect measure of the host response to MTB and has a good diagnosis value. It is elevated in the CSF of 60 to 100% of patients with TBM. A cutoff value of 9.5 U/L in CSF is taken to differentiate TBM from non-TBM. Dynamic monitoring of CSF-ADA activity may also be helpful.

**Imaging**

Neuroimaging plays a vital part in the diagnostic armamentarium of suspected cases of CNS-TB and helps ensure a timely and correct diagnosis. Neuroimaging ideally must include the entire neuro-axis. The modalities for evaluation include brain CT or brain MRI of which the contrast-enhanced MRI has the superior delineating ability. Newer MRI techniques further enhance the diagnostic quality in atypical or difficult cases.

The diagnostic triad, along with their frequency in TBM, consists of  (1) Extensive basilar leptomeningeal enhancement and exudates in 38 to 89%, (2) Hydrocephalus in 60 to 75%, (3) Cerebral infarcts in 15 to 28%, followed by tuberculoma in another 27% of cases.

In TBM, the exudates have certain areas of predilection. Optochiasmatic arachnoiditis is almost pathognomonic of TBM.

On CT, intense basal cisternal enhancement may appear as a characteristic spider leg appearance.

The basal pachymeningitis in TBM involves mostly the middle cerebral artery (M1 segment), circle of Willis, lenticulostriate and thalamo-perforating arteries causing a stroke.

Tuberculomas are visible as discrete, single, or numerous ring-enhancing lesions with marked perilesional edema. They are commonly located at the corticomedullary junction both in the brain and the spinal cord. Depending upon the pathological maturation stage, on CT, tuberculomas may have variable appearances; either as non-caseating lesions, solidly caseating lesions, or caseating masses with central liquefication or with central calcification (target sign on CT).

On MRI, they are hypointense on T1W and appear hyperintense on T2W images. Post-contrast images delineate either ring-shaped or homogeneous disc-shaped enhancement. Tuberculomas may be differentiated from metastases and gliomas by their unique metabolite pattern on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A complete and regular peripheral hypointense ring in susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) favors the diagnosis of tuberculomas.

Tuberculous myelitis may be visible as diffuse cord swelling with an altered signal on MRI. The phase contrast MRI is the technique of choice for depicting obliteration of spinal subarachnoid space, dural thickening, paraspinal exudates, clumping of cauda equine nerve roots, CSF loculations, cord infarction or syringomyelia in spinal arachnoiditis.
