Cardiac cirrhosis is a serious disorder with very high morbidity and mortality. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, liver specialist, nephrologist, internist, cardiac nurses, radiologist, and critical care nurses. The treatment of cardiac cirrhosis is based on the management of the underlying cardiac condition causing hemodynamic imbalance. Determination of the volume status and adequate management of fluids for these patients is important. Clinical features of cardiac cirrhosis may improve dramatically with adequate diuresis. Close monitoring of cardiac output is important to prevent ischemic hepatitis. Usual management of liver cirrhosis as indicated in the setting of liver dysfunction irrespective of the etiology, such as beta-blockers to reduce portal hypertension, diuretics for recurrent ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis in the setting of GI bleed.

The outlook for patients with cardiac cirrhosis is guarded. If the primary condition is not managed well, the prognosis is grave. Even those who survive are often left with residual multiorgan dysfunction.
