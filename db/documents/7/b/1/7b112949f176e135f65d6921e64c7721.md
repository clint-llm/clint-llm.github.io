Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy occurs due to decreased blood supply to the optic nerve head. It is divided into a) Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (A-AION) and b) Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). These two conditions have entirely different ethology and approach to their diagnosis and management is completely different. This activity will focus on the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of NAION.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of NAION.
- Summarize the evaluation of NAION.
- Outline the management options available for NAION.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance NAION management and improve outcomes.
