**Antimicrobial Stewardship in Dentistry and Oral Surgery**

Dentists prescribe 10% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions and prescribe the most antibiotics as a specialty in the United States.

Clostridioides difficile colitis occurred in 0.007 per 1000 patient days, and anaphylaxis occurred in 0.003 per 1000 person days.

Unneeded antimicrobials contribute to antimicrobial resistance, a growing threat in the community. In the United States alone, antibiotic-resistant bacteria result in the deaths of 23,000 people per year.

Dentists working in academic hospitals or university settings were found more likely to prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis correctly when compared to dentists practicing elsewhere.

Increased education regarding the dangers of antibiotic-related events, including Clostridiodes difficile colitis and antimicrobial resistance, could make a difference. A small prospective cohort study involving infectious diseases antimicrobial stewardship personnel outreach to private practice dentists showed an increase in appropriate antibiotic prescribing from 19% pre-education to 87.9% post-education.
