**Paranasal Sinuses**

When there is facial trauma, the paranasal sinuses can act as a “crumple zone” protecting the more delicate structures of the brain from injury.

**Dural Venous Sinuses**

The emissary veins, which traverse the cranium and enter the dural venous sinus system, are a pathway that infection can enter the brain. This phenomenon is possible because the emissary veins have no valves. Emissary veins from the pterygoid plexus in the infratemporal fossa and ophthalmic veins from the orbit also pass through the cavernous sinus and can be a source of infection. In each case, infection is possible because the veins begin extracranially and become intracranial.

Subdural hematomas typically result from injury to cerebral veins where they enter the superior sagittal sinus, which occurs because the cerebral veins are more mobile than the dura-encased sinuses. This type of intracranial hemorrhage occurs between the dura mater and arachnoid mater, layers of the lining of the brain. A subdural hematoma can occur from the most trivial injury.
