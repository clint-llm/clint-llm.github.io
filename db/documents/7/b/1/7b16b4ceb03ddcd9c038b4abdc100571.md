It often takes an interprofessional team to manage a patient with buphthalmos. The team may include ophthalmologists, optometrists, pediatricians, and other health care providers. The main aim of treatment is to reduce IOP to prevent progressive corneal opacification and glaucomatous optic atrophy, thereby preserving existing vision.

Over the years, the prognosis of children with buphthalmos has slightly improved. However, despite treatment, many children require low vision aids and visual rehabilitation.
