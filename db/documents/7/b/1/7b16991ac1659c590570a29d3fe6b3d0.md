Regardless of where the procedure is to be performed (clinic, hospital, surgery center), a recovery nurse fully dedicated to monitoring the patient is strongly recommended to detect serious complications such as hematoma formation. Close follow-up within 1 week should be scheduled in the clinic in the post-operative period to ensure there are no signs of infection, hematoma, or rejection.
