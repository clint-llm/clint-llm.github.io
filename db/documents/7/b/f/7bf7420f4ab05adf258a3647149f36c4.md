Intravenous fluid therapy typically consists of using colloids, crystalloids, or a combination of both. Crystalloids such as normal saline contain usually contain salts with or without glucose. When crystalloids are given, they precipitously equilibrate with and disperse throughout the whole extracellular fluid space. In initial fluid resuscitation, crystalloids are classically the first line fluid used in most patients.

Colloid solutions such as albumin typically contain proteins or large glucose polymers. When a colloid solution is given, the high protein content the solution keeps the solution intravascular for a more extended period. Secondarily, this type of solution works to support the intravascular plasma oncotic pressure. Colloids cost substantially more than crystalloids and are associated with more complications, both of which tend to limit their use.
