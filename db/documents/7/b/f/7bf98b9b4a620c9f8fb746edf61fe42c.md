Single osteoporotic compression fractures can lead to more fractures.  Treatment of the underlying disease is warranted to decrease the risk of future vertebral column fractures. Vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty have been shown to lead to a reduction in pain, decrease in mortality and morbidity, and improved quality of life. Traumatic compression fractures will often heal on their own and likely will not require surgical intervention. However, those with unstable vertebral fractures will undergo surgical stabilization. Those who have incomplete spinal cord injuries may see an improvement in outcome if decompressed early.
