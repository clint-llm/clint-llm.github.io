Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is poorly responsive to any multimodality therapy.

**Prognostic Factors**

The favorable prognostic indicators of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma are

- Younger age (less than or equal to 60 years old)

- An absence of cervical or distant metastases

- Small tumors (less than or equal to 5 to 7 cm)

- Unilateral tumors

- An absence of local invasion of the surrounding tissue or nodal involvement

- An incidental finding of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma within a thyroidectomy specimen
