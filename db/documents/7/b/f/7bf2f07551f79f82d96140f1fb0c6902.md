Patients with pathological myopia may experience a marked drop in visual acuity secondary to a subretinal hemorrhage or myopic choroidal neovascular membrane. Despite prompt therapy, they can develop scarring and atrophy in the macula that results in a permanent central scotoma. They also face an increased risk of early cataract formation, glaucoma, and retinal detachments, which can also lead to visual impairment.
