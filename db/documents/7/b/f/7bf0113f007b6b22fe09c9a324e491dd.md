An understanding of the exposure risk for individual populations is key to decreasing the risk of Mn toxicity. Current acceptable levels of Mn in drinking water are 400 micrograms per liter, and a tolerable intake of Mn from dietary sources should not exceed 60 micrograms/kg.

The possibility of occupational exposures should encourage workers to raise alarms to their managerial staff should OSHA infractions become evident. Patients should advocate for current standards in respirators while welding or operating in industrial manufacturing. Patients should compare their current workplace standards with those set by OSHA to ensure they are not at risk of developing manganism or other toxic metal exposures.

Patients and families must be aware of the potential for infant toxicity. Reconstituting formula with Mn-laden water increases the risk dramatically in these patients due to naive Mn excretory function. Female patients with a history of metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, or another condition predisposing them to Fe deficiency should also have a heightened awareness, given their propensity for developing manganism secondary to elevated transferrin expression. Those on parenteral nutritional supplementation such as TPN should also be aware, given the by-passing of normal homeostatic regulatory functions that keep intestinal absorption low as well as those affected by the hepatic and pancreatic disease.

In the setting of the above risk factors and exposure history, identification of the characteristic symptomatology should raise the alarm for Mn. Early psychiatric symptoms followed by neurologic deterioration similar to that of Parkinson disease are the hallmark of toxicity. Treatment with avoidance of further exposure, systemic chelators, and vitamin and nutritional supplementation will then ensure, likely in consultation with neurology and toxicology services.

The prognosis for patients exposed to Mn is generally favorable among the few studies recorded. Trends towards the partial recovery of most symptoms are common, with residual deficits in those of more advanced age at the time of onset and motor and behavioral deficits generally.
