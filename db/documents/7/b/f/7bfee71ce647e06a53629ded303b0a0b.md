Capsule retention can occur in 1.3% to 1.4% of patients undergoing capsule endoscopy and is the most common complication. Capsule retention is usually asymptomatic and diagnosed 2 weeks after capsule ingestion via abdominal plain film x-ray. Patients with known or suspected obstructions, strictures or fistulas should not undergo capsule endoscopy due to their increased risk of retention. Crohn's disease increases a patient’s risk of having capsule retention to 2.6%. A dummy capsule called an Agile Patency Capsule can be used to determine patency of the intestinal lumen for the safe use of capsule endoscopy. Radiographic imaging such as small-bowel follow-through, CT or magnetic resonance enterography can also be used to assess lumen patency prior to the administration of the capsule. Capsules may need to be surgically or endoscopically removed if symptomatic retention occurs. The video capsule can also be retained in a Zenker or Meckel's diverticulum. There is a small risk for aspiration of the capsule or cricopharyngeal impaction of the capsule.
