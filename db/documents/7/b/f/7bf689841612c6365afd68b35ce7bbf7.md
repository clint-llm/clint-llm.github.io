The most common etiologies for recurrent acute rhinosinusitis mirror the other subtypes of sinusitis. Viral upper respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of sinusitis and are typically self-limiting.Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, other Streptococcus species, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus.Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) often colonizes the nares and leads to recurrent sinusitis, especially in patients who have already received multiple courses of antibiotics.

There tends to be some etiologic overlap between recurrent acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Non-invasive fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus may be isolated in these patients. Anatomic obstructive abnormalities, including turbinate hypertrophy, conchae bullosa, stenosed sinus ostia, Haller cells, nasal polyposis, nasal masses, and septal spurs/deviation, can predispose the nasal cavity and sinuses to infection.
