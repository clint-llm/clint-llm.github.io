Neither combined oral nor progestin-only contraceptives seem to cause weight gain (except for DPMA), but it is commonly reported by patients as a side effect.

**Combined Estrogen-progestin Contraception**

Common complaints from a combined oral contraceptive include mild symptoms such as breast tenderness, nausea, headaches, bloating, and unscheduled bleeding, but these typically resolve in most users. Other side effects include increased risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism (DVT, PE, MI, stroke), mild increase in blood pressure, and possible increases in breast and cervical cancer risk. COCs also have been demonstrated to cause seemingly unfavorable changes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (increased triglycerides, decreased HDL and increased LDL cholesterol, increased insulin and glucose levels, and reduced insulin sensitivity).

**Progestin-only Contraception**

Unscheduled bleeding and changes in menses are the most common side effects associated with POPs, as they are the most well-tolerated of the progestin-only options. Other side effects include acne, hirsutism, and an increased prevalence of follicular ovarian cysts.

The DMPA injection can delay returning to fertility for as long as 18 months after it is stopped and should not be chosen by women thinking about pregnancy within the next two years.
