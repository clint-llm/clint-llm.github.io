It is not usually advisable to continue the diet for a period longer than four to six weeks due to potentially deleterious effects on the microbiome and vitamin, mineral, and fiber intake. However, the reintroduction of small amounts of FODMAP-containing foods may aid in the gradual restoration of intestinal microflora by supplying important prebiotics to oneâ€™s diet.

Patients on the low-FODMAP diet should refrain from eating wheat and rye products, certain stone fruit (including apricots, cherries, peaches, and prunes), persimmons, watermelons, artichokes, beets, some cruciferous vegetables, fennel, garlic, leek, onions, peas, barley, some nuts and seeds, lentils, chickpeas, mushrooms or artificial sweeteners. The list mentioned above is not comprehensive, but instead provides an idea of the scope of limitations. Patients are, however, encouraged to eat tofu, certain nuts and legumes, and quinoa in the meanwhile.
