# Introduction

The development of simulation has been evolving in technology and utilization over the last several centuries, with the increased application over the past 2 to 3 decades in the field of pediatrics. Today, simulation-based medical education (SBME) is widely used by a majority of pediatric training programs and is marked by a large variety of technologies and continued interest and availability of research in the field.

The history of simulation in medicine has its origins in fields such as the military, commercial aviation, and NASA.

Today, there are numerous simulation centers and hospitals that utilize a variety of human patient simulators that range from low to high fidelity mannequins, the most sophisticated of which are capable of responding to learner stimuli such as drug administration, compressions, voice, physical exam, and even procedural interventions.

# Issues of Concern

Simulation has provided pediatric educators an invaluable tool in which to practice high-risk and low-frequency events safely. As with any educational modality, several challenges must be faced to optimize effectiveness. Cost is one of the most common constraints cited in implementing a simulation curriculum. In addition to the purchase prices, there are costs associated with the storage, maintenance, and management of equipment as well as associated personnel costs. The time and commitment required for the development of a high-quality scenario-based curriculum must also not be underestimated.

In regards to the clinical application, translation to patient care outcomes and skill retention has been debated in the past. Though there has been conflicting data, a meta-analysis published in 2015 showed a frequently positive correlation between simulation-based assessments and patient-related outcomes.

High-quality simulation research is critical to continue to provide the best practice of evidence-based educational modalities. A review of healthcare simulation research shows a consistent need for high-quality methodologies between adult and pediatric specialties.

The desire for improved simulation research in pediatrics has led to the development of research groups, including the International Network for Simulation-Based Pediatric Innovation, Research, and Education (INSPIRE) group, which is dedicated to advancing pediatric simulation training and research. In pursuing their mission, INSPIRE published a guideline for simulation-based research in 2014, and again reemphasize the difficulty in measuring patient outcomes of simulation training. They hope that the creation of registries of educational interventions will improve power and sample size of simulation studies to draw better conclusions from SBME research.

# Curriculum Development

SBME has become an integral part of pediatric training programs. It is useful not only as a training tool but as a means of formative as well as summative assessments. The methodology of curriculum development, along with simulation delivery, has been explored in various studies, and some important principles are necessary to understand to maximize learning outcomes.

Debriefing has invariably been thought of as a key tenet in simulation training and is an example of the utilization of simulation as a formative assessment tool. There is variability on how and when the debrief can occur, but should always focus on reflection with feedback delivered and a learner-centered plan to improve future performance.

Other best practice frameworks to consider when developing curricula in pediatric simulation include deliberate practice, mastery learning, and rapid cycle deliberate practice, all of which exemplify a means of summative assessment (i.e., comparing the learner performance to a benchmark and, ideally, to a minimum level of competency in a skill).

Deliberate practice provides learners with immediate feedback and coaching to allow necessary adjustments to their practice of a skill. Repetitive practice is a key component to deliberate practice and allows for multiple repetitive training/practice opportunities. This strategy has been applied in pediatrics for improved CPR performance and lumbar puncture success in pediatric residents.

Mastery learning takes deliberate practice one step further; the learners practice the skill until they have reached a competency, meaning it is performed at a mastery level without coaching.

Some novel developments in SBME include rapid cycle deliberate practice, which combines the above learning principles into one instructional design. The learner proceeds with a scenario and is interrupted frequently or “paused” to receive corrective feedback from an expert and continues or starts over the scenario in a corrected way. The learner receives many chances to achieve mastery of the skills being taught. This method has been shown in pediatric residents to improve skill acquisition in resuscitation and septic shock management but has not demonstrated long term retention compared to other modalities.

There are currently several published, expert-reviewed, simulation curricula in the field of pediatrics, notably in the fields of pediatric emergency medicine (PEM), and pediatric critical care; this includes longitudinal curricula for pediatric fellows, pediatric residents as well as emergency medicine residents.

# Clinical Clerkships

The liaison committee on medical education (LCME) highly encourages the use of simulation in a medical student curriculum. It has been shown that the incorporation of high fidelity simulator-based scenarios into a third-year pediatric clerkship curriculum had high student satisfaction and led to improved objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) performance.

Furthermore, there is a trend in medical student education to place greater emphasis on patient encounters early within a student’s training. As an example, a pre-clerkship pediatric simulation curriculum was implemented at Johns Hopkins that consisted of a 5-day simulation course, after which the shelf scores and procedure performance evaluations improved.

# Procedural Skills Assessment

The ACGME requires pediatric residents to gain competence in thirteen procedures, and despite formal training, studies show that residents desire more procedural training.

Classically observational checklists have been utilized in the assessment of procedural skills; the scores are then based on completed or omitted observed steps. Another form of competency assessment is a global rating scale (GRS), which provides a more global impression on a skill's performance

Some high technology simulators such as mannequins and computer-based simulators can also provide real-time procedural feedback, including depth of compressions, bag-mask pressure, or timing of procedures. The usefulness of data like those mentioned in real patient practice, however, is not well understood. As Cheng et al. note, compressions on a mannequin do not translate well to appropriate compressions on a live infant.

Further studies identifying standardized methods of evaluating procedure skills, solidifying time to skill decay, defining best practice for skill maintenance, and improved patient outcomes are several goals of future pediatric SBME.

# Medical Decision Making and Leadership Development

An important skill to acquire in high acuity situations like pediatric resuscitation is the ability to communicate well within a team. A desire for more standard measures to evaluate communication skills has led to validated performance checklists to assist in pediatric resuscitation leadership evaluation.

Good communication skills can lead to improved teamwork in a healthcare setting. Teamwork has demonstrated to result in improved clinical performance after a simulation education intervention.

In addition to communication with interdisciplinary teams, it is equally important for a pediatrician to communicate with patients and families. Standardized patients have shown to be an effective communication teaching tool for palliative care training in pediatric critical care fellows.

# Clinical Significance

There are many reasons pediatric SBME has increased in utilization, demand, and necessity over the past 20 years. One of the most important is medicine's increasing focus on patient safety. This has obvious implications on a trainee's experience, including the pressure of increased faculty supervision and a push for demonstration of competence. In line with improving patient safety includes a push to practice evidence-based medicine. A growing trend in medicine is the desire to reduce unnecessary interventions and decrease iatrogenic complications; specific to pediatrics is an interest in decreasing lumbar puncture rates in neonatal fever, increased utilization of bag-mask ventilation over intubation, and reduction in appendectomies for uncomplicated appendicitis to name a few.

In addition to decreasing procedure necessity, medical students and residents are increasingly under work hour restrictions.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Simulation-based medical education is an evolving area of growth in training medical personnel, particularly because of the demand for increased efficiency of training time. Multiple fields of medicine, including clinicians and nurses, are focusing attention on improving simulation education. A focus on high-quality simulation ensures the best outcomes of educational interventions.

Multiple personnel in-training can be involved in the implementation of a medical simulation curriculum, particularly when it comes to training to improve teamwork among nurses, clinicians, and pharmacists. Indeed, communication skills are an important skill to acquire to be an effective leader of a team and enhance teamwork in medicine. Simulation has been used to enhance team communication in pediatric healthcare settings and demonstrate improved patient outcomes.
