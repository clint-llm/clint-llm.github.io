The cause of a Tillaux fractureÂ is a traumatic injury to the ankle. It is felt that a supination external rotation injury is needed to create this fracture pattern. Also, medial rotation of the leg on a fixed foot has been reported as a mechanism of injury

The distal tibial physeal closure occurs in a predictable pattern in the 18 months transitional period before skeletal maturity. The central portion of the physis closes first followed by the anteromedial then posteromedial portions and the lateral portion closes last. This specific closure pattern contributes to the etiology of the juvenile transitional ankle fractures ie. Tillaux and Triplane fractures.
