Interprofessional communication is the key to success in patient care. Most medical errors that occur are secondary to a lack of communication. All team members must be at liberty to speak up when they have concerns. For IVC thrombosis, coordination of care by physicians is necessary. An emergency medicine physician may initially evaluate the patient, but they must be able to contact the vascular surgery, nephrologist, etc., for further management. In addition to communication skills is the importance of knowing one's limits. There must be a willingness to ask for help when needed to improve healthcare outcomes. Excellent communication and awareness of personal limitations among all team members are critical.
