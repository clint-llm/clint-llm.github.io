Patients diagnosed with syphilis should receive counsel regarding disease transmission and risk reduction via safe sex practices. Pregnant patients should also have counseling on the possibility of vertical transmission. All patients should receive education on the signs and symptoms of neurosyphilis. Patients under therapy for syphilis should be informed about the need for repeat titers as a test of cure; patients who are treated for syphilis and fail to achieve a four-fold decline in non-treponemal titers within 6 to 12 months may have unrecognized neurosyphilis necessitating further work-up and more aggressive treatment. All patients diagnosed with neurosyphilis should also undergo testing for HIV. Providers should inform patients who are undergoing treatment of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction as a potential occurrence.
