Ectopically presented antigens on the tumor cells that are otherwise exclusively expressed in neurons are presumably the triggers for paraneoplastic encephalitis. Postulated mechanisms of these abnormally expressed antigens include tumor genetic alterations, gene amplification, and protein overexpression. Also, some of these so-called onconeural antigens are normally expressed in immunologically privileged sites like the testes, but for unknown reasons, they get identified by the immune system as foreign, which in turn mounts an immune attack.

Antigen-presenting cells then activate antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells against neuronal structures, which in turn activate B cells to turn into plasma cells that produce the detectable antibodies. It is the parenchymal invasion of the cytotoxic T cells that leads to neuronal cell damage. As mentioned earlier, the antibodies are directed to intracellular antigens, therefore, cannot cause the disease directly but simply serve as a valuable marker for the underlying tumor, e.g. Anti-Yo antibodies in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration are characteristically associated with ovarian cancer.

Interestingly, it was shown that this same immune attack sometimes limits the growth of cancer itself and may rarely stop it.

In addition, immune checkpoint blockers may trigger a similar cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune attack, which can cause adverse effects, including limbic encephalitis.

Most commonly, PEM is associated with the Anti-Hu antibody, which is also called ANNA-1 (Anti-Neuronal Nuclear Antibody type 1). Sometimes, it is associated with Anti-CRMP5 (Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 5). Other times, the associated antibodies are the Anti-Amphiphysin.
