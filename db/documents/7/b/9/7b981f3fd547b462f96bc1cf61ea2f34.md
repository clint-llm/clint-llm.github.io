There is a direct relationship between an increased serum PSA level and the likelihood of a prostate cancer diagnosis. However, it isn't always clear at which point further evaluation is warranted.

No PSA value can guarantee the detection of prostate cancer. Values as low as 1.1 ng/mL routinely overlook up to 17 percent of prostate cancers.

The single general consensus standard normal upper limit for PSA is considered to be no more than 4 ng/mL. (PSA is measured either in ng/mL or mcg/L. These units are equivalent, so 1 ng/mL = 1 mcg/L.)

**Age-Adjusted PSA**

Using 4 ng/mL as the single upper normal limit for serum PSA does not adequately account for the natural increase in serum prostate-specific antigen that is expected to occur with age. There is a direct correlation between age and serum PSA concentration, with an expected  3.2% increase per year demonstrated in healthy 60-year-old males.

The 95th percentile PSA value is commonly used for the age-adjusted normal reference ranges, which are as follows:

- Males 40-49 years: no more than 2.5 ng/mL

- Males 50-59 years: no more than 3.5 ng/mL

- Males 60-69 years: no more than 4.5 ng/mL

- Males 70-79 years: no more than 6.5 ng/mL

**Free and Total PSA:**Free PSA is a subset of intact PSA. A decrease in the ratio of this serum biomarker [free PSA/total PSA] may be utilized to improve the sensitivity of prostate cancer detection when initial total PSA values are between 4 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL.

When the total PSA is between 4 and 10 ng/mL, free % PSA can be used.

- The higher the free % PSA, the lower the risk of cancer.

- The actual cancer risk varies according to age.

- If the free % PSA is <10%, the cancer risk is 50%.

- If the free % PSA is >25%, the cancer risk is <10%.

**PSA Density:**The volume of the prostate in cubic centimeters can be calculated by the formula: (width cm x height cm x length cm) x 0.52. These values are measured by either an MRI or prostatic ultrasound. When the volume of the prostate is known, a PSA density calculation can be done by dividing the total PSA in ng/mL by the prostate volume in cc's. A PSA density of 0.15 or more is considered suspicious for cancer.

**PSA Velocity:**A slow increase in PSA level is expected over time, but a more rapid rise could indicate malignancy. Generally, a yearly increase in PSA of no more than 0.75 ng/mL higher per year and no more than 25% is considered acceptable. Greater increases are considered suspicious.

**PSA  Doubling Time:**Aggressive, rapidly growing prostate cancers are more dangerous than slow-growing malignancies. This can be estimated by the PSA doubling time in patients with known prostate cancer. A PSA doubling time of 2 years or longer is generally considered reasonably acceptable. As the PSA doubling time becomes shorter, the 5-year prostate cancer mortality rate increases. A PSA doubling time longer than 12 months is associated with a 5-year prostate cancer-specific death rate of 10% compared to those with a doubling time of 1 year or less who have a 50% mortality.

**Prostate Biopsies**

The decision to perform a biopsy should include at least two elevated PSA values and take into consideration the patient's age, comorbidities, medical history, family history, high-risk factors, physical examination, urinary symptoms, reasonable life expectancy, and personal preference after a thorough review of the risks and benefits. It should also include the results of an MRI or prostate cancer bio-assay examination, if available.

Performing a prostate biopsy can be a complicated decision. In general, biopsies should not be recommended in patients where there is an unacceptable risk (i.e., unable to stop anticoagulant therapy safely), where treatment would not be accepted even if a dangerous cancer were found, or where the life expectancy due to age or comorbidities is well below the minimum ten years necessary to see a significant benefit from treatment. Patients should be fully informed of the risks and benefits of the biopsy as well as given sufficient time to decide on their choice.

**PSA Use in Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer**

Active surveillance for prostate cancer is based on the finding that low-grade, low-stage prostate cancer is relatively indolent, causing most patients no clinical harm. Low-risk (Gleason 3+3=6) and selected low intermediate-risk (Gleason 3=4+7) patients are generally considered candidates for active surveillance. Most of these patients (about 25%) will not show any disease progression and can safely avoid the side effects and complications of definitive cancer therapy. A repeat biopsy 6 to 18 months after the initial diagnosis remains the standard of care for patients on active surveillance. This is due to the high reported rate of pathological reclassification of up to 35% after the second confirmatory biopsy.

Prostate MRIs are recommended prior to the rebiopsy to optimize the results and to track the progress of any identifiable lesions.

Recommended PSA monitoring for patients on active surveillance is generally every six months. A significant change would generally be considered a PSA level >0.75 ng/mL or >25% a year, a PSA doubling time of <3 years, or a total PSA >10 ng/mL. A notable change in the MRI PIRADS score (from PIRADS 3 to PIRADS 4 or 5) or marked enlargement of a known cancer nodule would also be considered significant and prompt a rebiopsy.

In men with stable PSA levels and digital rectal examinations, follow-up prostate biopsies after the initial "confirmatory" rebiopsy should generally be considered every 2 to 4 years, and MRI scans should be repeated every 1 to 2 years, depending on risk factors and comorbidities. MRI alone is not reliable enough to completely supplant prostate biopsies.

The suggested protocol was compared to an alternate regimen where, after the initial "confirmatory" biopsy, repeat biopsies were performed only when significant changes in the MRI scan or PSA level were detected. This regimen eliminated many prostate biopsies compared to a scheduled protocol but missed too many clinically significant cancers.

The use of finasteride or dutasteride (5-alpha-reductase inhibitors) and enzalutamide (an androgen receptor inhibitor) have not been shown to significantly affect slowing PSA level increases or cancer progression in patients on active surveillance.

**PSA After Definitive Prostate Cancer Therapy**

Overall, a recurrence rate after definitive therapy (either radical surgery or radiation) is expected in 25% to 40% of patients who undergo definitive curative treatment.

**Following a radical prostatectomy**, all prostatic tissue should have been removed. Therefore, any detectable PSA following the surgery indicates some remaining prostatic tissue, usually presumed to be cancerous.

Slowly rising PSA levels are sometimes caused by a small amount of residual prostate tissue left behind after surgery. This can occur in 5% to 15% of all radical prostatectomy patients and does not necessarily indicate residual cancer. Adjunctive therapy should be considered if the PSA level reaches 0.4 ng/mL or more.

The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines on localized prostate cancer define a post-radical prostatectomy biochemical recurrence as two consecutive serum PSA levels >0.2 ng/mL.

**After definitive radiation therapy**, PSA levels tend to fall relatively slowly. It may take 18 months for these levels to reach a nadir.

A biochemical recurrence after definitive radiation therapy is defined as 2 PSA levels>2 ng/mL above the nadir level.

In a large retrospective study of 2694 men, all treated with external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer, those who demonstrated a biochemical recurrence developed metastases at a median of 5.4 years.

**European Urological Association Risk Stratification for Progression After Biochemical PSA Recurrence**

Biochemical recurrence after definitive therapy for localized prostate cancer is a significant, independent risk factor for metastatic disease, cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality. The European Urological Association has suggested the following high and low-risk stratification categories for both post-radical prostatectomy surgery and radiation therapy patients.

- Low-risk

- After radical prostatectomy: PSA doubling time >12 months and Gleason score <8
- After radiation therapy: Interval to biochemical failure >18 months and Gleason score <8

- High-risk

- After radical prostatectomy: PSA doubling time <12 months and Gleason score >7
- After radiation therapy: Interval to biochemical failure and Gleason score >7

**PET Scans For Post-Prostatectomy Biochemical PSA Recurrence**

When the PSA level is >0.2 ng/mL, prostatic PET scanning can be performed. This will help differentiate localized recurrences in the prostatic bed after radical prostatectomies that might benefit from pelvic irradiation from those with disseminated disease where systemic treatment is preferred. Some experts recommend PET scans for all post-radical prostatectomy patients with a biochemical recurrence and suitable PSA levels, while others recommend a more selective approach using a risk stratification model.
