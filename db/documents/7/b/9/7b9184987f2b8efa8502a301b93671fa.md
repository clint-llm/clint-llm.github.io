The exact pathogenesis of hydroa vacciniforme remains unclear. Some studies suggest sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB)Â is the etiologic agent,

In contrast, the differences in clinical severity and incidence between patient populations in hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma allude to a combination of genetic, immunologic, and/or environmental events. This model suggests a patient with a particular genetic background is predisposed to develop chronic EBV-infection after the initial infection. Subsequently, in response to inflammatory stimuli, EBV-infected cytotoxic T cells and/or NK cells are recruited locally and cause tissue damage. Also, small studies have shown an upregulation of interferon-y and multiple genes that encode chemokines, including CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL4 in serum levels of patients. This data suggests the role of chemokines and potentially gene polymorphisms in disease severity.
