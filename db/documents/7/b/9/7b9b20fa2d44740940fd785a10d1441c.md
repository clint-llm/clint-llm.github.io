Cannabis plants and their derivatives delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have been evaluated for the treatment of many disorders, including lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). Control of IOP is the most significant modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, an optic neuropathy that causes irreversible blindness. This activity reviews cannabinoidsâ€™ mechanisms of action in lowering intraocular pressure, their potential neuroprotective properties, and local and systemic side effects.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanisms by which cannabinoids decrease intraocular pressure.
- Describe the proposed pathways through which cannabinoids may exert their neuroprotective effect.
- Identify the most common systemic side effects associated with cannabis use.
- Review the most common acute psychotropic side effects associated with cannabis use.
