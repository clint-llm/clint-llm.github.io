An otoscope will allow for the assessment of the pinna, external auditory canal, and tympanic membrane. The light also enables the examiner to perform a close examination of the pre- and postauricular areas. Disposable specula of varying sizes are required for the otoscope. To assess the mobility of the tympanic membrane, pneumatic otoscopy can be performed. This requires an otoscope with a pneumatic bulb and speculae with rubber rings to create an air-tight seal within the canal.

A tuning fork is required for the differentiation between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. The ideal tuning fork of choice has a long period of tonal decay that also causes minimal vibration sense (to avoid the patient's sensing vibration and confusing this with sound). Otolaryngologists traditionally utilize a 512-Hz tuning fork as it provides the greatest balance between these two characteristics.
