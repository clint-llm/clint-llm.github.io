# Introduction

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory nucleic acid amplification technique used to denature and renature short segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences using DNA polymerase I enzyme, an isolate from Thermus aquaticus, known as Taq DNA.

PCR is a procedure that selectively focuses on a minuscule segment of DNA in a test tube.

# Testing Procedures

Polymerase chain reaction procedures begin with the collection of a small sample of DNA in a test tube.

The specific temperature is determined based on the physical and chemical properties of the specific primers used in the solution.

In order to initiate the functionality of DNA polymerase, double-stranded DNA is mandatory for the occurrence of replication.

Following 30-40 cycles, repetitive cycles eventually taper off due to the limited capability of the reagent as well as other contributing factors such as accumulation of pyrophosphate molecules, excessive self-annealing, and the presence of PCR inhibitors in the sample.

Proteinase K has the propensity to break down Taq polymerase.

Following the aforementioned steps of PCR, the next step includes agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide.

There are various advantages of using PCR in basic and biomedical sciences. Over the years, it has acquired a renowned reputation making it the gold standard procedure for a multitude of reasons.

**Real-time PCR**

Real-time PCR is an alternative method to examine small segments of DNA  via the shortened duration of the cycles, elimination of post-PCR procedural handling steps, implementing fluorogenic labels as well as efficient detection of emissions.

The disadvantage of real-time PCR in comparison to conventional PCR is that it requires opening the system to track the progression of amplicons.

**Reverse Transcriptase-PCR**

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a procedure that uses mRNA for DNA amplification via DNA polymerase.

To date, Real-time PCR and RT-PCR are employed simultaneously to assess the quantitative difference in gene expression among various samples.

Samples for PCR testing may be acquired from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, nostril, and oral cavity.

# Interfering Factors

There are a few drawbacks of polymerase chain reaction. This test is highly sensitive and has the susceptibility to detect the slightest contamination in DNA and RNA yielding inaccurate results.

# Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings

In PCR, amplification of DNA can be observed with fluorescent dyes that bind to double-stranded DNA or probes that are sequence-specific. The amplification reaction consists of a quantification cycle, Cq. Cq is described as the number of fractional cycles necessitated for the fluorescence to meet the preset for quantification.

After determining Cq, a qualitative conclusion can be deduced, or a quantitative analysis may be further conducted. Cq is dependent on PCR efficiency; PCR efficiency involves assessment of the amplification efficiency which is explained as fold increase/cycle with a fold value ranging from 1 to 2, with a fold value of 2 indicating 100% PCR efficiency. PCR efficiency is derived from standard curves and amplification curves.

Standard curve PCR efficiency increases the likelihood of dilution errors ultimately affecting the accurate quantification of several clinical and biological samples. However, individual amplification curves do not include confounding variables for the analysis of PCR efficiency resulting in varying results compared to standard curves for the same assay. Accurate computation of the target quantity is essential for appropriate amplification efficiency that will be reflected in the analysis.

A low PCR efficiency requires additional cycles to reach an appropriate quantification threshold resulting in a higher Cq. The presence of amplification following the utilization of a valid probe-based assay is indicative of the sample containing the particular target and subsequently concluding it as diagnostically positive. Due to the Poisson variation, the lack of amplification is not a valid criterion to classify a reaction as negative.

As mentioned earlier, qPCR measures DNA or RNA in various diagnostic and biological samples via the Cq. qPCR is often computed with the assumption that all assays are 100% efficient. Additionally, reporting of qPCR involves Cq, delta-Cq, or delta-delta-Cq. For significant and purposeful interpretation of biological, clinical, and diagnostic samples, efficiency corrected should be utilized in qPCR testing. Thus, it is essential to consider these factors when interpreting and reporting PCR efficiency to yield adequate results.

The stage and degree of a patient's ailment can be reckoned with by utilizing cycle threshold (Ct) values concurrently with clinical manifestations and disease history. Moreover, healthcare professionals can further surveillance the progression of diseases and foreshadow steps to recover and resolve ailment by repeating the PCR test and generating serial Ct values. Ct values can also aid contact tracers to focus on patients with a more elevated viral genomic load, signifying a higher risk for disease transmission.

# Clinical Significance

PCR is used in basic and biomedical sciences which has substantial laboratory and clinical significance due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and rapidity.

Rapid detection of microbial pathogens via rapid real-time PCR allows for clinicians to promptly administer tailored treatment thus, reducing hospitalizations, preventing inappropriate administration of antibiotics, in turn, antibiotic resistance.

Additional microbial pathogens that are infamous for causing food-borne related illnesses such as group B streptococci, mycobacterium species, Bacteroides vulgatus, and escherichia coli (e.coli) can also be identified via real-time PCR testing.

PCR is also used to study the histopathology of various viral and cellular genes to comprehend and diagnose malignant diseases in humans.

# Quality Control and Lab Safety

**Contamination of PCR**

Conventional PCR is the gold standard for screening and detecting a wide scope of scientific areas of interest due to its promising results. Adequate handling following PCR procedure is imperative for proper assessment of amplicon.

To prevent contamination of PCR, it is crucial to have a designated area of the laboratory exclusive for PCR testing to limit unnecessary turbulence within the area.

A specific section in a freezer, that is closest to the laminar flow hood, should contain enzymes and buffers.

Automatic pipettes are known to cause contamination, thus, positive displacement pipettes should be employed for proper handling of the reagents.

Prior to using microcentrifuge tubes consisting of reagents exclusively for PCR, centrifugation is necessitated for approximately 10 seconds to allow the fluid to settle at the bottom of the tube preventing the occurrence of contamination.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Efficient use of PCR by the interprofessional healthcare team can lead to early detection of bacterial and viral pathogens prompting earlier treatments. This can also further aid in preventing antibiotic resistance and viral outbreaks, respectively. The interprofessional health care team comprises a primary care physician, pathologist, infectious disease specialist, lab technician, and nurses.

The polymerase chain reaction is a nucleic acid amplification testing procedure that consists of denaturing, renaturing, elongating, and amplifying a short segment of DNA or RNA. This is implemented by incorporating DNA I polymerase, which is derived from Thermus aquaticus, also known as Taq polymerase. Taq polymerase consists of thermostable properties preventing the irreversible alteration of the DNA or RNA physical and chemical properties, making it ideal for the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction procedure for diagnosing a wide range of bacterial and viral infections, as well as screening genetic diseases.

Laboratory technicians should be fully trained in the safe handling and use of samples to ensure quality and prevent contamination. Face masks, gloves, and hair caps should be worn at all times in the laboratory. Storage of solutions in their respective equipment (pipettes, glassware, plasticware) should be done with caution to prevent DNA from being exposed and contaminated. The interprofessional team of healthcare providers should be up to date with the latest guidelines and management strategies for patients with confirmed communicable diseases.

This integrated team-based approach provides care coordination from all interprofessional team members to further advance the health of patients suffering from infectious diseases. Patients should also be thoroughly informed on laboratory findings and counseled on preventative measures, and the importance of medication compliance is needed. Patients should also be educated on disease transmission and preventive measures they can incorporate to ensure public health and safety. Continuous communication between the healthcare team and their patients can help form a therapeutic alliance to prevent complications and spread of communicable disease, ensure patient and public safety, and preserve the quality of life.
