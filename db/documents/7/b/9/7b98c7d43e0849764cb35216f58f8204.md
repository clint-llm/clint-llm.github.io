Recently, dermoscopic findings in Zoon balanitis have been described in 11 patients, which include focused curved vessels (100%) in different shapes, including serpentine (100%), convoluted (45 % to 50%), chalice-shaped (27.3% to 25%); orange-brownish structureless areas (75% to 81%), linear irregular blurry vessels (36.4% to 37.5%) and dotted vessels (25% to 27.3%). These findings might assist the clinical diagnosis of Zoon balanitis, distinguishing it from its main differential diagnoses, such as erythroplasia of Queyrat, which shows scattered glomerular vessels; psoriasis, which displays regular dotted vessels and seborrheic dermatitis and non-specific balanoposthitis, usually showing linear irregular unspecific blurry vessels.

The use of reflectance confocal microscopy in differentiating between balanitis and carcinoma in situ has been evaluated. Balanitis shows a nucleated honeycomb pattern and vermicular vessels scattered small bright sells and round vessels,Â whereas carcinoma in situ shows an atypical honeycomb pattern, disarranged epidermal pattern, and round nucleated cells.
