The initial action that is needed by the nurse at the time of patient presentation when there is a possibility of an ectopic pregnancy is to establish the patient safety net, consisting of obtaining a full set of vital signs, placing the patient on the monitor, and obtaining at least one large bore intravenous line.  If the local nursing scope of practice includes drawing blood for labs, that will be needed as well for these patients.

If the patient is stable, the next nursing action will be to hydrate the patient. The transabdominal portion of the ultrasound assessment is best performed with a full bladder. Oral hydration is able to help with this, but intravenous fluid administration is another option, depending on if the patient is being allowed to take anything orally at that time.  It is important to coordinate the hydration status with the provider performing the ultrasound as it can be very uncomfortable for the patient if she is required to hold a full bladder for an extended time.

After the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy is established, it will be important for the nurse to be a patient advocate.  The patient should be given mental support and institutions may have support systems in place for mothers who have been diagnosed with a nonviable pregnancy.
