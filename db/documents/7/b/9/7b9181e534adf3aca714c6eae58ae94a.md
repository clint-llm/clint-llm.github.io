The use of the sphenopalatine ganglion block has been proposed as a treatment option for a variety of pain syndromes. Ho et al. evaluated the level of evidence for the use of SPGB in various pain syndromes utilizing the Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine scale:

(1a) Systematic review/meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies (1b) Single, well-designed, randomized controlled trials with a narrow confidence interval(2a) Systematic review/meta-analysis of cohort studies(2b) Single cohort studies or randomized control studies of low quality(3a) Systemic review/meta-analysis of case-control studies(3b) Single case-control studies(4) Case series, as well as cohort and case-control studies of poor quality (5) Expert opinion

Grades of recommendation are as follows:

(A) Level 1 studies with consistent results(B) Deduction from level 1 studies, or level 2 or 3 studies with consistent results(C) Level 4 studies, or deduction from level 2 or 3 studies(D) Level 5 evidence, or inconclusive/inconsistent results in the literature

Indications for SPGB based on the highest level of evidence and grade of recommendation are as follows:

- Cluster headache: 2b, B

- Second-division trigeminal neuralgia: 2b, B

- To help reduce the need for analgesics after endoscopic sinus surgery: 1b, B

- Migraine headache: 2b, B

Due to a lack of controlled studies, the following proposed indications received a level of evidence of 4, grade C: headache syndromes including hemicrania continua, trigeminal neuralgia, and dural puncture headache. SPGB has level 4, grade C evidence for additional conditions including intractable hiccups, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), intercostal neuralgia, and dysmenorrhea.
