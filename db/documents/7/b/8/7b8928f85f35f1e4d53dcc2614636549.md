The precise etiology is not fully understood but are many proposed theories. HV deformity is most likely a result of multiple contributing factors, including genetics, short first metatarsal, dorsiflexed first metatarsal, flexible or rigid forefoot varus, rigid or flexible pes planovalgus, gastrocnemius equinus, abnormal foot mechanics, and joint hypermobility. Interestingly, certain arthritic conditions such as gouty arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and research show that rheumatoid arthritis predisposes patients to HV deformity. Furthermore, HV deformity is more commonly seen in connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, as well as in Down syndrome.

Any muscle imbalance in the foot due to conditions such as a stroke, cerebral palsy, or myelomeningocele can also cause an HV deformity.

HV deformity is common in people who wear tight shoes and heels, which is regularly cited as the cause. However, men who wear sensible footwear often have marked HV deformity, while women who wear footwear that significantly compresses their feet have no deformity. This fact has given rise to the thought that footwear exacerbates an underlying bony abnormality rather than acting as the primary cause.
