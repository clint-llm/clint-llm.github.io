Six potential mechanisms have been suggested for BCI: direct, indirect, bidirectional, deceleration, blast, crush, concussive, or combined.

The cardiac chamber injury distribution reflects the position of the heart in the chest, where the right ventricle and right atrium are more anterior compared to the left ventricle and left atrium.

Most patients who survive BCI have less severe injuries that range from structural injuries to electrical and conduction disturbances.
