Adie tonic pupil is a neuro-ophthalmological disorder distinguished by a lack of response to light and a pupil that is tonically dilated but is able to respond to accommodation.

Iridoplegia is the paralysis of the sphincter muscle of the iris. Many times, it is a result of direct trauma to the orbit but can also result from inflammation or even from eyedrops. There are three types of iridoplegia:

- Accommodative iridoplegia: The inability of the pupil to constrict during accommodation

- Complete iridoplegia: Will not constrict regardless of stimulation

- Reflex iridoplegia: Also known as Argyll Robertson pupil; will not constrict to light, but retains the ability for accommodation reflex

It is important to differentiate the ptosis in Horner syndrome from damage to the oculomotor nerve. In Horner syndrome, the ptosis occurs with a constricted pupil due to loss of sympathetic innervation to the eye (inability to dilate leads to constriction). This is compared to damage to the oculomotor nerve where the ptosis is accompanied by a dilated pupil (due to damage to the parasympathetics and inability to constrict via the sphincter pupillae).
