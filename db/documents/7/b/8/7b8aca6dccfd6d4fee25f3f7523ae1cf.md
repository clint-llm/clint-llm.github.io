The prognosis of femoral head osteonecrosis is dependent upon many factors. One is the point in which it gets diagnosed. The earlier in the disease process the diagnosis occurs, the more effective the preemptive measures, and the better the prognosis. In addition to advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, some other indicators of a poor prognosis include lateral head involvement (as opposed to medial), the involvement of greater than one-third of the weight-bearing portion of the femoral head (as determined by MRI), and age greater than 50-years-old
