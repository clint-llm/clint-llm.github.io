Hearing assessment in children is age and ability dependent and will be addressed per age group here.[9]

**Neonates**

Otoacoustic Emissions

In the UK, all newborns and those who require less than 48 hours of special care in neonatal intensive care (NICU), are offered evoked otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing within the first 4-5 weeks of birth as part of a Newborn Hearing Screening Programme.

Automated Auditory Brainstem Response

This investigation is offered to all newborns who have spent over 48 hours in the neonatal intensive NICU and is also offered to those who do not pass two OAE tests.

**6-8 months**

Distraction techniques

An assistant engages the child’s attention, and the tester, whilst placed behind and to the side of the child, makes sounds of different intensities. The child is assessed to see whether they turn to the side of the noise.

**9 – 36 months**

Visual Reinforcement Audiometry

The child is placed at a table with some toys with two speakers either side that produce sounds. If the child looks towards the speaker playing a sound they are delivered a visual reinforcement (such as a flashing light).

**24-60 months**

Conditioned Play Audiometry

The child is conditioned to perform a task in response to an auditory stimulus such as placing a ball in a cup. Once the task is learned the sound volume is reduced in order to determine their hearing threshold.

**Over 60 months**

Pure Tone Audiometry

A 5 years of age most children can undergo pure tone audiometry. Hearing thresholds are determined by presenting sounds of various frequencies and at various intensities until the quietest sound is reliably detected 50% of the time. This test requires a higher level of attention and therefore is rarely done below the age of 5 years.

**Other investigations**

Additional investigations will be tailored to the precise clinical picture. In syndromic children, chromosomal testing is advised. There is also a role for imaging in the form of either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Some authors advocate measurement of renal function and testing for connexin-26, which is a marker who sensorineural hearing loss. In some children, imaging studies may prove useful and detect abnormalities of the cochlea or the cochlear nerve. Finally, ECG may be useful in children with Jervell Lange Nelsen syndrome. The ECG will reveal a prolonged QT interval, which can lead to syncopal attacks and death.
