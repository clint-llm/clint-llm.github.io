Generally, since most individuals with MPO deficiency do not suffer from infections and are typically asymptomatic, prophylactic antibiotics are discouraged and not indicated. However, caution should be taken in patients afflicted with concomitant diabetes mellitus, with a high incidence of localized and systemic infections, where prompt and aggressive treatment with antimicrobials is usually necessary to control infections. It is prudent and cautious to avoid treatments that  can increase the  propensity of fungal infections such as prolonged use of antibiotics or steroids.
