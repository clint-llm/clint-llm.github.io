Endoscopic vein harvesting has become the preferred technique for the harvesting of the great saphenous vein to be used in multiple surgical interventions, specifically, coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

A recent meta-analysis of 43 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies (OT) of 27789 patients took place to compare the two techniques. Forty-six percent of them underwent EVH versus fifty-six percent for the conventional open procedure. The results supported the superiority of the EVH technique for multiple endpoints, including conduit failure, myocardial infarction, mortality, and wound infection.
