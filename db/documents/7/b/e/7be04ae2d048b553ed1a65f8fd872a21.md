Adaptive optics helps visualize individual cellular components in vivo and demonstrates individual photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelial cells, ganglion cells, and retinal microvasculature in various acquired and inherited retinochoroidal pathologies. This helps in understanding the basic pathophysiology of these disorders, screening and diagnosing them at the subclinical stage, formulating newer therapeutic interventions, and monitoring cellular-level responses to therapeutic interventions.

The various indications include retinal vascular disorders like hypertensive retinopathy, retinal vasculitis, intraocular inflammation, diabetic retinopathy, macular pathologies like central serous chorioretinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration, inherited retinal dystrophies, drug-induced maculopathies, choroidal pathologies, and glaucoma.
