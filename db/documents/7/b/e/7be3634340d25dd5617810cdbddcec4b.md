Patient education plays a significant role in the deterrence of the processes that can cause pathological lymphadenopathy.

- Appropriate vaccination, good hygiene, good public sanitation, and careful infectious disease protocols can significantly decrease the rate of recurrence, and transmission of infections causing lymphadenopathy.
