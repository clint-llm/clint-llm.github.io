The biochemical process of hematopoiesis begins in the yolk sac; this is how the developing embryo can produce red and white blood cells and platelets.Â The primitive hematopoietic system is hypothesized to involve a sequential migration of hematopoietic stem cells. They travel from the yolk sac to the liver and later the liver to the bone marrow. The hematopoietic stem cells of adults are in the bone marrow.

The yolk sac contains cells that are CD34+, a nonspecific antigen associated with hematopoiesis. Researchers have observed these CD34+ cells in the bone marrow during the 14th week of gestation, further supporting this hypothesis of the migration of hematopoietic stem cells.
