Acute stress disorder (ASD) was initially added to the DSM-IV 20 years ago, but there is limited data on its prevalence, especially in the general population. While ASD is a separate diagnosis compared to PTSD, but the difference is limited to the duration of ASR symptoms, making ASD prevalence measurement more complicated. ASD prevalence is highly variable based on the study and nature of the trauma. The prevalence rates of ASD were reported less than one week post-injury at 24.0 to 24.6% and 1 to 2 weeks post-injury at 11.7% to 40.6%.

Furthermore, there have been some epidemiologic studies on specific populations. A meta-analysis performed by Wenjie Dai et al. in 2018 on the prevalence of ASD among road traffic accidents showed a pooled prevalence of 15.81% (95% CI: 8.27-25.14%). Thirteen studies in eight countries pooled a total of 2989 accident patients. The results show the significance of early ASR symptoms in surveillance and therapy.
