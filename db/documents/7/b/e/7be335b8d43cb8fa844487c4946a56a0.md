Pneumocystis jirovecii typically presents with a constellation of nonspecific symptoms such as fever, nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and shortness of breath. Since it is an opportunistic pathogen, a history of immunosuppression is essential for colonization. Underlying causes of immunodeficiency and their risk of developing an opportunistic infection should be assessed. History can reveal signs and symptoms that can indicate an underlying undiagnosed HIV infection. Also, it is important to evaluate the recent use or any dose changes of immunosuppressive medications, including glucocorticoids. Studies have shown that the presentation of PCP appears to be more severe, often fulminant, in non-HIV-infected patients.

Due to the nonspecific nature of PCP presentation, further evaluation is needed to accurately diagnose. A physical exam can determine the level of respiratory distress with tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Lung examination is usually indicative of pneumonia with the presence of crackles or rhonchi, but patients can also present with normal or clear lung sounds. A thorough examination is important as it can reveal other signs that can indicate an underlying infection, immunologic disorder, or malignancy.
