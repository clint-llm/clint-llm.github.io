When loperamide is taken in large quantities and/or with other drugs that may alter its pharmacokinetic effects, such as p- glycoprotein inhibitors, loperamide produces opioid-like symptoms. These include a sensation of euphoria, miosis, central nervous system depression, and respiratory depression. Treatment of loperamide overdose and toxicity is primarily supportive. Naloxone, including an intranasal naloxone bolus, intravenous naloxone bolus, or naloxone infusion, may be used in patients with respiratory depression.

Taken in large quantities, loperamide can cause systemic effects similar to opioid toxicity (central nervous system depression, respiratory depression) as well as lethal cardiac conduction abnormalities.
