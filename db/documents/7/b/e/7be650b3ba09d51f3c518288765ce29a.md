Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that occurs in 2 forms- vitamin K1 or phylloquinone (present in green leafy vegetables) and vitamin K2 or menaquinone (synthesized by the gram-negative bacteriaÂ in the intestines).

A deficiency of vitamin K in the body leads to inadequate activation of these clotting factors and hence leads to bleeding in the body, which manifests as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn or, more specifically, known as VKDB.
