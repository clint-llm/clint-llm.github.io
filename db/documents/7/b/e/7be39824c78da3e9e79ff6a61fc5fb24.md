Patients taking loratadine require monitoring regarding symptomatic relief, sedation, and any anticholinergic effects (such as dilated pupils and drying of oral mucosa).

Renal and hepatic function also requires close monitoring by the primary care physician for patients with kidney or liver impairment, with appropriate dose adjustment of the drug made accordingly.

Cardiac function should also be monitored in individuals with a history of cardiac arrhythmias to prevent loratadine over-medication.

Loratadine storage should be in a cool, dry place at a temperature of between 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit.
