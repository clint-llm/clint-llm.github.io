The prognosis of type II hypersensitivity reactions differs based on timely diagnosis, carefully considering the possible differential diagnoses. Additionally, it varies from one disease category to another. For instance, the overall prognosis of hemolytic disease of the newborn is good if identified and treated promptly. In the case of myasthenia gravis, most patients have a near-normal life span with the current treatment modalities. Fifty years ago, the mortality rate was around 50% to 80% in the myasthenic crisis, and now it has reduced substantially to 4.47%.
