Since crocodile tears syndrome is a rare syndrome, it is important that it is correctly diagnosed at its onset and improve patient outcomes. At times, if the symptoms of Bell palsy are not bothersome for the patient, they frequently opt for only periodic monitoring of the condition. This was observed in a 74-year-old female in Brazil who did not get the correct diagnosis of crocodile tears syndrome for nine years.

One study on punctoplasty revealed that mild grades of punctal stenosis could be managed with rectangular 3-snip punctoplasty, but in patients with high-grade punctal lesions, there was a high recurrence rate of functional epiphora and punctal restenosis.

Hence, it is important to increase awareness and knowledge about crocodile tears syndrome among physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and dentists who may come across these cases on a regular basis. Further, they must be able to educate patients and their families. More important, an interprofessional approach to problems of the eye can also result in early detection of other nasolacrimal duct lesions like cancers.
