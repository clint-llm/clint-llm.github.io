Patients with GT should be educated on how to recognize abnormal bleeding. Additionally, they should be instructed to avoid unnecessary trauma and not to take medications that interfere with platelet function. The importance of dental hygiene should be stressed as well. Some patient subgroups require special attention, i.e., young female patients may need instructions for heavy menstrual bleeding. Family planning discussions, including the risk of childbirth and affected children, are important for some patients as well.
