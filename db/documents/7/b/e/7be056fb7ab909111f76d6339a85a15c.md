The diversity in size, location, and volume of fibroids is reflected in the diversity of their clinical presentation, which ranges from asymptomatic to intensely debilitating.  While most patients with fibroids are asymptomatic, approximately 25-30% of patients present with severe symptoms.

When fibroids present symptomatically, the most common complaints include AUB, pelvic pain/pressure, increased urinary frequency, constipation, and infertility.

Fibroids’ adverse effects on fertility are largely dependent on their location and ability to distort normal uterine and adnexal anatomy, thereby preventing gamete transport, embryo implantation, and/or the maintenance of early pregnancy.

On a bimanual exam, the examiner may palpate an enlarged, bulky, irregularly shaped uterus. If the fibroids are predominantly posterior, one may appreciate fullness in the posterior cul-de-sac with an anteriorly displaced cervix. An irregular contour or increased uterine size may not be appreciated in patients with small intramural or submucosal fibroids. Whether or not physical findings are significant, a patient with the symptoms described above is sufficient to warrant further evaluation.
