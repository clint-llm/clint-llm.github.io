Thiamin is a water-soluble vitamin and is absorbed into the blood from the gastrointestinal tract. It then circulates in the blood and ultimately gets excreted in the urine. Small amounts of thiamin are stored in the liver, heart, kidney, and brain, but only for a short duration.

In blood, the thiamin diphosphokinase enzyme converts thiamin into its active form, thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). TPP plays different roles during different steps of metabolism, glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway.

- TPP works with enzyme functions during the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and branched-chain amino acids.

- TPP acts as a cofactor at several steps during glycolysis and oxidative decarboxylation of carbohydrates.

- TPP acts as a coenzyme for the mitochondrial enzyme complexes such as α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. These enzymes have a critical role in the Krebs cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thiamin deficiency decreases the activity of these enzymes, which impairs the conversion of lactate into pyruvate, leading to the accumulation of lactic acid. Lactic acidosis may cause focal damage to certain brain structures, such as mamillary bodies and the posteromedial thalamus, which can be seen on MRI.

The presence of TPP is required by the erythrocyte transketolase enzyme during the pentose phosphate pathway of nucleotide synthesis and provides reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate for several synthetic pathways.
