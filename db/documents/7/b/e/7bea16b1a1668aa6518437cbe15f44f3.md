Hurthle cell neoplasms originate in thyroid follicles from follicular cells (hence they were initially grouped with follicular thyroid tumors) and are characterized by the presence of Hurthle cells, which are eosinophilic oxyphilic cells with round to oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and small densely packed mitochondria giving a granular appearance to the otherwise vastly empty cytoplasm.

These Hurthle cells are also known as oncocytes or Askanazy cells. Hurthle cells can be seen in follicular thyroid tumors as well as other types of thyroid disorders, including non-malignant conditions to a varying degree. Thyroid tumors are classified as Hurthle cell neoplasms when more than 75% of the tumor consists of Hurthle cells.
