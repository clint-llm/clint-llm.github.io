The first 13 years of a pediatric patient's life constitute significant developmental changes in oral anatomy. Tooth eruption and teething process cause inflammation and discomfort to the gingiva, maxilla, and mandible. This inflammation results in irritability and pain that can last up to a week before and after tooth eruption. A child's first dental visit is often recommended by the age of 1 as the upper incisors are usually erupted by that time. Treatments for teething vary; however, this normal process of oral development is generally treated conservatively.

Early childhood caries (ECC) is possibly the most important and common dental disease in pediatric patients.
