Hemothorax is a collection of blood in the space between the visceral and parietal pleura (pleural space). The clinical findings in such patients include respiratory distress and tachypnea. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of hemothorax and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of hemothorax.
- Outline the use of a trauma protocol in the evaluation of patients with hemothorax.
- Describe the steps in the resuscitation and management of hemothorax.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care in patients affected by hemothorax.
