Initial management should focus on removing the cold insult from the patient and having the patient avoiding cold exposure. Patients should be instructed to keep gloves or socks readily available in case of cold exposure. Additionally, lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, are recommendations due to the association with vasospasm, which can exacerbate pernio symptoms.

Following initial management, second-line therapy can include topical, medium to high dose corticosteroids as well as nifedipine. Clinical data is conflicting on the efficacy of topical corticosteroids in the resolution of pernio lesions. As with all topical corticosteroid therapy, patients should avoid excessive and extensive use due to the increased likelihood of tissue atrophy that is associated with long-term topical corticosteroid use.

Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, has potentially been found to be useful as a treatment of pernio due to its vasodilatory effects, and in some small studies showed efficacy in reversing pernio lesions and even prevented further lesions from developing.
