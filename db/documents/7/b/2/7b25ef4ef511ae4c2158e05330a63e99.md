Patients should be educated on their risk factors for acute cholangitis and advised to reduce modifiable factors with a low-fat diet, increased physical activity, and healthy weight when possible. Individuals with a history of gallstone and biliary ductal diseases should be educated on the clinical presentation of cholangitis and advised to seek immediate medical attention when symptoms arise. Early identification and treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis in high-risk patients could decrease the risk of cholangitis. A diligent search for common bile duct stones in patients presenting with cholecystitis may decrease risk also. For individuals that undergo ERCP, prophylactic antibiotics prior to the procedure can decrease the risk of cholangitis. Patients who have recurrent acute cholangitis may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics to help reduce the incidence and severity of the disease.
