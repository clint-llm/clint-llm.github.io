The diagnosis of ONSM is confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially with gadolinium-enhanced fat-suppression sequences. The MRI has become the gold standard for the diagnosis and has obviated the need for tissue biopsy. On MRI, they appear isointense to grey matter on both T1 and T2 weighted imaging. ONSM is a sensitive lesion to gadolinium contrast, demonstrating vivid enhancement which contrasts with the non-enhancing optic nerve. On MRI axial images, it will present with the characteristic "tram-track" sign, which corresponds to the enhancing outer ONSM encircling the inner non-enhancing optic nerve. On the coronal images, this will be seen as a "doughnut" or "non-enhancing dot" sign. Typical appearances of ONSMs on imaging are tubular expansion of the meninges surrounding the optic nerve (62%), globular (23%), fusiform (11%), and focal enlargement of the optic nerve (4%).

A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbit and head can show the bony anatomy and hyperostosis produced in secondary tumors. Calcifications can also be seen in the ONSM. CT scans can also demonstrate the classic tram track sign.
