Caring for patients in an austere environment presents a unique set of challenges regarding logistics, availability of therapies, and ability to perform diagnostic tests. The primary challenges in HAPE center around the ability to deliver supplemental or hyperbaric oxygen therapy to a patient at altitude and challenges with descent. The ability of those involved in a patientâ€™s care to work as a team to meet these demands is critical. Unlike in a traditional hospital setting, the healthcare team member may have less experience than other team members, such as non-medical guides, who have knowledge of local resources and can coordinate descent. In wilderness settings, ideal therapies may not be feasible, and the only treatment option may be temporizing until definitive care.
