Imaging of metacarpal fractures should include standard PA and lateral as well as an oblique view to further examine the ulnar-most digits. An external rotation oblique film allows for visualization of the fourth and fifth MC fractures and CMC dislocations, while an internal rotation oblique film allows for visualization of the second and third MC and CMC fractures/dislocations.

Classification of these injuriesÂ has its basis in basic fracture characteristics. Examples include transverse, oblique, spiral, displaced, or comminuted. Location is also important and is usually divided into the distal aspect, the neck or head, the shaft, and the base, the most proximal portion. It is also important to consider rotational and shortening deformities, multiple metacarpal fractures, and the amount of initial displacement. These can be indicators of unstable fractures that will necessitate operative fixation.

As the loss of metacarpal height becomes more severe, the extension lag of the digit in question becomes more significant. Metacarpal-phalangeal (MCP) joints show an average of 20 degrees of hyperextension. Still, for every 2 mm of metacarpal height that is lost, there are a concomitant 7 degrees of extensor lag at the MCP joint.
