The two hallmarks of the Alzheimer disease pathology are 1) extracellular plaque deposits of the amyloid beta peptide and 2) flame-shaped neurofibrillary tangles of the microtubule-binding protein tau. The production and deposition of the amyloid beta peptide appear to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and form the basis of the amyloid cascade hypothesis.

Amyloid plaques are easily visible on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining. These are extracellular and can be stained with special amyloid stains like Thioflavin-S or Congo Red. Under polarized light, they show characteristic apple-green birefringence typical for an amyloid protein.
