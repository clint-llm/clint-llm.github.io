**Public Health Impact of Obesity**

- **Life expectancy:**Obesity, the modern lifestyle disease, not only cause serious illness but also substantially decreases the average public life expectancy. Obesity in adulthood is a strong predictor of early death. Framingham Heart Study, a prospective cohort study, revealed that adults who were obese at 40 years lost 6 to 7 years of expected life. However, in obese people who smoked, the years of life lost almost doubled.

- **Quality of life:**Obesity affects both the physical and psychosocial aspects of quality of life, more significant among morbidly obese individuals.Â  The self-perceived Health-related quality of life (HRQL) among obese individuals worsens with increasing BMI. The effect of obesity on HRQL is assessed most frequently by SF-36 (Short-Form Health Survey), comprising 36 questions covering eight domains including physical functioning, physical role limitations due to physical health problems, social functioning, bodily pain, general mental well being, emotional role limitations, energy, and general health perceptions.

- **Prevalence of obesity-associated diseases:**The individuals who are obese in their childhood tend to remain obese in adulthood and prone to high risk for Obesity-related non-communicable diseases (OR-NCD) at a younger age.

- **Employment:**Obesity is one of the leading reasons for discrimination in the hiring process for employment, more noticed among obese females than obese males.

- **Economic impact:**Obesity is estimated to account for more than 20% of all annual health care expenditures in the United States.
