The fetal circulation system is distinctly different from adult circulation. This intricate system allows the fetus to receive oxygenated blood and nutrients from the placenta. It is comprised of the blood vessels in the placenta and the umbilical cord, which contains two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. Fetal circulation bypasses the lungs via a shunt known as the ductus arteriosus; the liver is also bypassed via the ductus venosus, and blood can travel from the right atrium to the left atrium via the foramen ovale. Normal fetal heart rate is between 110 and 160 beats per minute. When compared to adults, fetuses have decreased ventricular filling and reduced contractility.

Fetal circulation undergoes a rapid transition after birth to accommodate extra-uterine life. Human understanding of fetal circulation originated from fetal sheep, but ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the fetal period now provide detailed information.
