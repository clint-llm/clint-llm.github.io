R. akari is transmitted by the bite of Liponyssoides sanguineus, the mouse mite. In Greek, akari means mite, hence the name. Unlike other rickettsiae which target endothelial cells, R. akari targets the macrophage. R. akari infections were first reported in 1946 in New York City and caused vesicular lesions resembling chickenpox. Therefore, the disease caused by R. akari became known as rickettsialpox. There may be another identified vector besides the mouse miteÂ as there is a high seroprevalence of R. akari found in dogs in New York City and domesticated cats in California.
