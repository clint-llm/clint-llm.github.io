# Continuing Education Activity

Madelung deformity is a developmental or acquired deficiency of the volar-ulnar aspect of the distal radius. This can lead to a cosmetic or functional deformity of the wrist. Management of patients with symptomatic Madelung deformity is primarily operative, with various surgical options depending on the timing of diagnosis. This activity highlights the evaluation and management of Madelung deformity and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Madelung deformity.
- Review the classic presentation of a patient with Madelung deformity.
- Identify the typical imaging findings of Madelung deformity.
- Summarize the treatment considerations for a patient with Madelung deformity.

# Introduction

Madelung deformity is a deformity of the distal radius causing a deficiency in the volar ulnar corner, frequently causing wrist pain and cosmetic deformity. The proposed mechanism of the classic congenital form of the deformity is due to an abnormal Vickers ligament leading to restricted growth at the volar ulnar corner of the distal radius. There are various treatment options depending on the cause of the deformity, symptoms, severity, and skeletal maturity at the time of diagnosis.

# Etiology

Madelung deformity may be developmental or post-traumatic. The classic or congenital form of Madelung deformity is thought to be caused by the Vickers ligament, a pathologic ligament that crosses the ulnar radial physis, therefore tethering and restricting the growth of the volar ulnar corner of the distal radius, although the exact cause is unknown.

Vickers ligament is a hypertrophic radiolunate ligament, or less commonly, a radiotriquetral ligament.

This leads to an increase in radial inclination and volar tilt, causing subsidence of the lunate, therefore altering carpal kinematics. Classic Madelung deformity is more common in Leri-Weill dyschondrosis, a form of mesomelic dwarfism resulting in a triad of short stature, mesomelic disproportion, and Madelung deformity caused by mutations in the short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX).

A similar appearing deformity referred to as Madelung-like deformity may occur in other conditions, including post-traumatic, multiple hereditary exostoses, Ollier disease, and gymnasts wrist (repetitive microtrauma to the distal radial physis) when there is damage to the volar ulnar distal radius physis.

# Epidemiology

Madelung deformity is more common in women, with a ratio of approximately 4 to 1 female to male.

Patients typically present between 8 and 14 years old. Because Madelung deformity is due to growth plate tethering, the deformity increases in severity during growth and then remains stable at skeletal maturity. Pediatric hand deformities are present in 1 to 2% of the general population. Madelung deformity is relatively rare, with a prevalence of less than 2% of pediatric hand deformities, therefore less than 0.03% of the population.

# History and Physical

Patients typically present with wrist pain, decreased grip strength, and progressive loss of wrist range of motion. Wrist pain may be radial or ulnar and is more common when weight-bearing on an extended wrist. A decrease in wrist extension is common due to the dorsal displacement of the ulnar head. However, this does not commonly restrict forearm rotation.

Patients may present primarily with cosmetic complaints rather than with functional limitations.

The entire radius variant is a more severe form of Madelung deformity and is more common in Leri-Weill dyschondrosis. Patients with the entire radius subtype typically have pronounced radial bowing and more severe deformity. The reverse Madelung deformity results in dorsal subluxation of the carpus on the exam.

# Evaluation

Work up includes radiographs of the wrist and forearm. On AP radiographs, there will be an increase in radial inclination and lunate subsidence into the lunate fossa with a characteristic "v-shaped" carpus. On lateral radiographs, there will be an increase in volar tilt and relative volar subluxation of the carpus.

Due to the increased volar tilt of the distal radius, the ulna will be relatively dorsally displaced in appearance. If the deformity is severe and long-standing, the distal ulna may appear spiculated and irregular. If the distal radioulnar joint remains reduced, forearm and elbow radiographs may demonstrate the radial head pulling away from the capitellum.

This is more common in the entire radius subtype of Madelung deformity, with an increase in radiocapitellar distance greater than 4 mm. Radial bowing may also be present on forearm radiographs, especially pronounced in the entire radius subtype.

There have been proposals to perform screening MRIs in patients with a strong family history of Madelung deformity to enable prophylactic treatment. However, this is not routinely recommended.

MRI may also identify an oblique appearing triangulofibrocartilage complex as the deformity becomes more severe. There may be a bony physeal bar across the volar ulnar physis, although this may be apparent on radiographs as well.

The pathognomonic finding of a flame-shaped distal radial notch at the origin of Vickers ligament and distal radial metaphyseal flare may be seen on radiographs or MRI. Acquired Madelung deformity will not demonstrate Vickers ligament on MRI. However, MRI may demonstrate paraphyseal edema and physeal bridging in the post-traumatic subtype.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment of Madelung deformity depends on the severity and cause of the deformity and the timing of diagnosis. In patients with no to mild symptoms, conservative management may be appropriate. Conservative management consists of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, activity modification, and wrist splinting.

It is recommended that patients undergoing conservative treatment are evaluated with serial radiographs every six months until skeletal maturity. If the deformity continues to progress in a patient with significant remaining growth, prophylactic surgery can be done to prevent continued deformity. However, there is a significant amount of controversy in the literature regarding the timing of intervention.

There are a wide variety of operative interventions for patients with symptomatic Madelung deformity. In patients who have the congenital form of Madelung and remain skeletally immature, a resection of the Vickers or radiotriquetral ligament is typically performed. If a physeal bar is present with remaining growth potential, the physeal bar may be excised with the interposition of adipose tissue.

A classic treatment of congenital Madelung deformity in skeletally immature patients is the Langenskiold procedure which refers to a radial epiphysiodesis with fat interposition along with Vickers ligament resection.

Guided growth may be performed with an epiphysiodesis of the distal ulna and occasionally the unaffected aspect of the distal radius to even out the distal radio-ulnar joint. In a skeletally mature patient, a dome osteotomy is commonly performed to allow for correction of the deformity in multiple planes. If the prominent ulnar head is symptomatic due to ulnar abutment, an ulnar shortening osteotomy or resection of the ulnar head (Darrach procedure) may be performed. There is minimal research at this time on distal radioulnar joint arthroplasty as a treatment option.

# Differential Diagnosis

The Madelung-type deformity can occur due to trauma (from a fracture or repetitive microtrauma as seen in gymnasts' wrist) or tumors (including multiple hereditary exostoses and Ollier disease). This must be distinguished from true Madelung deformity as Vickers ligament will not be present; thus, treatment options and natural history will differ.

In any patient presenting with wrist pain and loss of range of motion, one must consider common causes, including fracture, arthritis, and tendinopathies, in the differential diagnosis. In patients presenting with deformity, tumors must be considered as well.

# Prognosis

The natural history of Madelung deformity is variable and poorly understood. It is likely to progress throughout adolescence until skeletal maturity is reached. Most patients obtain some degree of pain relief after Vickers ligament release and volar dome osteotomy, although it is not uncommon to require a secondary ulnar shortening osteotomy.

Vickers ligament release combined with dome osteotomy has been shown to provide radiographic improvement in the deformity.

# Complications

In patients with severe deformities who do not undergo surgical correction, there is a risk of extensor tendon attritional rupture with increasing duration of the deformity. The ulnar-sided extensors are more commonly involved.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Following a Vickers ligament release and physeal bar excision, a short arm orthosis is recommended for three to four weeks, followed by progressive range of motion and weight-bearing. Following an ulnar shortening or dome osteotomy, long-arm immobilization is recommended for two weeks, followed by an additional four weeks of short-arm immobilization. After a total of six weeks of immobilization, an active range of motion is allowed with progression to weight-bearing at three months.

# Consultations

If an associated genetic syndrome is suspected as a cause of the Madelung deformity, such as Leri-Weill dyschondrosis, Turner syndrome, or multiple hereditary exostoses, a genetics consultation may be warranted. Due to the rarity of congenital Madelung deformity, referral to a hand or pediatric hand surgeon should be considered to discuss surgical options.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

An informed discussion should be had between the patient, family, and surgeon in reviewing treatment options. Genetic counseling may be necessary.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Madelung deformity is relatively rare and thus may not be encountered in general medical training. Pediatricians and primary care providers must be aware of this progressive and potentially genetic condition. Patients may present first to a primary care provider or directly to a hand or orthopedic surgeon for evaluation.

Referral to the appropriate surgeon for evaluation is necessary to reduce delays in treatment. Referral to genetic counseling may be necessary and should be discussed with the patient and their family. The radiologist plays a crucial role in radiographic and MRI diagnosis, particularly in more mild cases.

Physical and occupational therapists are paramount in both nonoperative management and the postoperative period. Interprofessional management of patients with Madelung deformity allows for improved patient outcomes.
