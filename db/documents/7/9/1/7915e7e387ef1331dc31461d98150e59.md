There are reports of severe infusion reactions to Nivolumab. These are, however, uncommon. In the case of an infusion reaction, therapy must be immediately stopped and symptom-oriented care provided.

Some of the adverse effects are transitory and manageable. However, others are life-threatening and require aggressive immunosuppressive therapy and the permanent cessation of the drug.

Immune-mediated pneumonitis is a rare adverse effect associated with severe manifestations.

There have been reports that the occurrence of irAEs in patients receiving ICIs correlates with a better outcome.

The therapy of choice for severe and life-threatening irAEs consists of systemic corticosteroids. Prednisolone is given 1 to 2 mg/kg or intravenously, if necessary, along with prophylaxis for gastric ulcers and osteoporosis.
