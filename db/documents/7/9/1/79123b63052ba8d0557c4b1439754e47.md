Limited data is currently available to guide the long-term management of high altitude pulmonary hypertension. Several studies have shown that some treatments recommended for managing other causes of pulmonary hypertension have improved symptoms and mPAPs.

Patients suffering from high altitude pulmonary hypertension should be advised to move to lower altitudes. Some studies have shown that mPAPs for patients have normalized within two years of returning to lower altitudes.

- Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (i.e., Sildenafil) block the breakdown of NO, promoting pulmonary artery vasodilation and decreased mPAP.

- Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (i.e., Acetazolamide) are useful in the prevention of AMS. Studies have also shown a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance.

- Endothelin receptor blockers (i.e., Bosentan) have also been used to treat pulmonary hypertension.

Some studies have shown that venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be beneficial for severe cases in the acute setting. Despite all efforts and recommendations, if an individual develops irreversible pulmonary hypertension, the mainstay of treatment is pulmonary transplantation.
