History and physical exams are essential for identifying patients with vitamin B6 toxicity. Most patients will have neurologic symptoms and be seeking an evaluation for sensory neuropathy. A detailed medication reconciliation, including over-the-counter supplements, is needed. Since many over-the-counter supplements can have different doses of pyridoxine, having patients bring in medication and supplement bottles can be beneficial to ascertain the exact dosage of vitamins in a particular product.

The physical examination should include a thorough neurologic exam, including sensory, motor, gait, reflexes, cranial nerve testing, and muscle strength. Patients will typically present with bilateral sensory or motor changes, although a unilateral presentation is possible if there has been previous trauma or neurologic injury to an extremity.
