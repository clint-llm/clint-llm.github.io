Although the exact mechanism is currently under investigation,Â autoimmune encephalitis is thought to be an autoimmune process with an exaggerated response to a neuronal self-antigen. Unlike paraneoplastic encephalitis, which is a T-cell mediated response, antibodies in AIE are intrinsically pathogenic. They induce inflammation by targeting specific neuronal proteins. Synaptic proteins, ion channels, and intracellular receptors are the target proteins that have been established so far. When bound to target proteins, these antibodies induce conformational changes that lead to an inflammatory response.
