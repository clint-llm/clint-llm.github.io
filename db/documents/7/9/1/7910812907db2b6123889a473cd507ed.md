It is essential to monitor every patient for signs of a hypersensitivity reaction, especially if they have reacted to other beta-lactams in the past. In addition, since cefepime is often used empirically for broad-spectrum coverage, the culture sensitivities should have close monitoring to deescalate treatment to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic.

Renal function should be monitored with blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, especially when administering to the aging adult or patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction. In addition, it is essential to monitor for signs of neurological changes, particularly in the elderly, patients with renal dysfunction, and patients with febrile neutropenia.

The effectiveness of cefepime can vary drastically with critically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit. Drug monitoring is suggested if the patient's creatinine clearance is less than or equal to 50 mL/min or if the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the given pathogen is greater or equal to 4 mg/L. If treating outside of these parameters, then dose adjustment is indicated.
