To understand mediastinoscopy, one must know the anatomy of the mediastinum. The mediastinum is the region in the central chest between the two pleural cavities extending from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm. It contains several important organs, vessels, and nerves including the heart, the great vessels, the trachea, esophagus, phrenic and vagus nerves, thymus, and lymph nodes. The mediastinum has 5 borders — superior, inferior, posterior, anterior and lateral. The lateral borders comprise the left and right pleura,  the posterior border is the vertebral column, and the anterior border is the sternum. The superior and inferior borders are the thoracic inlet and diaphragm, respectively.

The mediastinum is divided into the superior and inferior mediastinum. This division occurs at the level of the sternal angle which is located at the level of disc space T4 to 5. The inferior mediastinum is anatomically subdivided into the anterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum. The middle mediastinum contains the pericardium and all that it encloses.
