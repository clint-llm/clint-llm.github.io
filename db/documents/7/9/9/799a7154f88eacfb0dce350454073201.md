Tympanostomy tube insertion is a very common procedure in children and adults. It is most commonly performed due to chronic fluid behind the eardrum to improve hearing and for recurrent middle ear infections to decrease the frequency of infections and direct application of antibiotics topically. Tympanostomy tubes are placed in the operating room for young children and the clinic for most adolescents and adults. Indications for tympanostomy tube placement include chronic otitis media with effusion with hearing loss, recurrent acute otitis media, and identification of at-risk children. This activity reviews the indications, risks, and complications for placement to tympanostomy tubes and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and performing tympanostomy tube placement.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for tympanostomy tube placement in children and adults.
- Identify high-risk patients for potential tympanostomy tube placement.
- Describe the impact of tympanostomy tube placement on the patient's quality of life.
- Summarize how the interprofessional team can effectively help patients achieve the best outcomes when having tympanostomy tubes placed.
