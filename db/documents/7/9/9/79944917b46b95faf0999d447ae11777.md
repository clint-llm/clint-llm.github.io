Since the condition is asymptomatic and benign, treatment should focus on patients who are cosmetically concerned. To date, various forms of treatments - topical, oral and surgical/physical have been attempted to improve upon the appearance of AKE-affected acral parts of the patients, but the outcome has been modest to poor. The various treatment modalities tried

- Topical - emollients and keratolytic agents including salicylic acid, urea, sulfur, coal tar, and tretinoin, as well as topical corticosteroids

- Oral - corticosteroids, antibiotics, dapsone, methotrexate, isotretinoin, acitretin

- Physical/surgical - cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, and surgery with laser erbium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er: YAG)

Treatment with oral retinoids, especially acitretin has been suggested as the most effective; however, relapse post-cessation is inevitable

Summarily, even in patients with acrokeratoelastoidosis  offered treatment for cosmetic improvement, three factors merit consideration and require explanation to the patient before commencing treatment:

- Modest response to be expected

- If using topicals - indefinite use may be necessary to maintain any improvement

- If planning oral/systemic therapy - the possibility of an almost inevitable relapse on stoppage of the drug, and the adverse effects of the drug(s)
