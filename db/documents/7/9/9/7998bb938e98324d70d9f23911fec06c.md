Patient education is a vital portion of any health care encounter, especially including vaccines and immunizations. Understanding the patient's vaccination schedule is essential and can help alleviate any misunderstandings and associated anxiety with the patient's vaccination.

The vaccination schedule is different for each age group. The US Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC), in coordination with The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP),Â  provides updated guidelines annually for health professionals to understand when and what vaccinations are necessary. The CDC has vaccination schedules for infants, children and teenagers, and adults on their website. For patients that have missed vaccinations or have special needs due to autoimmune diseases and the like, guidelines are available on the CDC website.
