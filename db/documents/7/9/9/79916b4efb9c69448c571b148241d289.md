Contraindications for placement of right heart catheterization are

- Insertion of the catheter through a site where is an active infection

- Presence of a Right sided ventricular assist device

- Lack of consent

A relative contraindication is the presence of left bundle branch block. If this is the case, due to the risk of right bundle branch block during catheter insertion, external or transvenous pacer should be placed at the moment of the procedure to prevent complete heart block.
