There is no specific lab test to identify TSS. A complete blood count (CBC) may show leukocytosis or leukopenia. Bandemia is common. Evaluation of multisystem organ involvement including CBC, CMP, CK, and coagulation studies should be drawn to evaluate for the clinical criteria of TSS.Â The CDC defines multisystem organ involvement as vomiting or diarrhea, myalgias, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) greater than two times the upper limit of normal, mucous membrane hyperemia (vaginal, oral, or conjunctival), BUN or creatinine two times the upper limit of normal, bilirubin or AST/ALT two times the upper limit of normal, Platelets less than 100,000, or altered level of consciousness without focal neurologic signs.

Life-threatening hypocalcemia is prominent throughout the disease and should be repleted accordingly. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged coagulation times are also common. Blood cultures and cultures from any suspected source should be obtained. Lumbar puncture should be performed in patients with fever and mental status change to evaluate for meningitis after obtaining coagulation studies.
