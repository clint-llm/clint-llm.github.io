Pneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic pathogen, classically associated with AIDS, that can have serious health consequences, including death. Due to the advent of cART, Pneumocystis pneumonia has become less common in this population. However, HIV patients should be encouraged to follow with their infectious disease specialists to optimize their treatment and monitor their immune response closely. When indicated, prophylaxis, for this and other pathogens, should be initiated without delay.

In other immunocompromised populations, the guidelines are not as defined, and recommendations by specific societies and health institutions should be followed. Clinicians should always be considering and adjusting the regimen according to the patientâ€™s comorbidities and response to previous therapies.
