The definitive treatment for a duplication cyst is surgery. The surgical approach can be open (laparotomy or thoracotomy) or minimally-invasive (laparoscopic or thoracoscopic) and depends on the expertise of the surgeon.

Management of antenatally or incidentally diagnosed asymptomatic lesions: Antenatal ultrasound can diagnose these anomalies, and early surgery should be done. This is not only due to malignant transformation, but also, if left untreated, a significant proportion of these cases may develop complications such as intussusception, volvulus, hemorrhage, etc.

Symptomatic cases: Early surgery is recommended in all the symptomatic cases.

Intrathoracic esophageal duplication cysts: These require a posterolateral thoracotomy. These can be removed by simple excision. In large cysts, decompression of the cyst may help in the better dissection of the cyst.

Gastric and intestinal duplication cysts: Laparotomy with excision of the cyst can be done in the majority of cases. Resection with end-to-end anastomosis might be required in tubular duplications or those intimately associated with the bowel wall. Long tubular duplications or multiple duplications involving the small intestine can be removed by performing mucosal stripping or Wrenn's procedure.

Rectal duplication cysts: These cysts might present as presacral masses or imperforate anus with rectovaginal fistula. Therefore, these may require a posterior sagittal or abdominoperineal approach for cyst excision.

Special scenarios:

Synchronous cysts in the thorax and abdomen: Synchronous lesions are seen in 10%-15% of the cases.

Neurenteric cysts: A proper evaluation with MRI of the spine and surgical planning with the neurosurgery team is crucial. If the intraspinal component is significant, the intraspinal portion should be removed first.
