The primary indication for pretrichial brow lifting is the presence of clinically significant brow ptosis, generally brought to the attention of a surgeon by a patient who complains of drooping eyebrows or difficulty seeing things above eye level. Brow ptosis can be addressed with several different approaches, but the pretrichial incision is best suited for patients who are satisfied with their hairline position or who have high hairlines and want to have the hairline lowered or otherwise reshaped as in the case of facial feminization.

Like other coronal-type approaches, the pretrichial incision also provides excellent access to the frontal calvarium and periosteum, frontal sinus, and NOE region; it also permits exposure and division of the corrugator muscles, which can alleviate the vertical glabellar rhytids known as "frown lines" or "number elevens." Lastly, the superior exposure provided by pretrichial brow lifting makes it a good approach for revision brow lifting, although the degree of lift expected from a pretrichial brow lift is equivalent to that achieved an endoscopic lift.
