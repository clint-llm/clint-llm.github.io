Spinal stenosis occurs most frequently in individuals over the age of 60. In adults over the age of 65 years undergoing spinal surgery, lumbar spinal stenosis remains the leading pre-operative diagnosis. Many conditions correlate with the development of spinal stenosis, but symptomatic spinal stenosis tends to occur most frequently in the setting of degenerative changes.

The majority of spinal stenosis tends to occur in lower lumbar levels as dorsal root ganglion diameter tends to be increased in this region, causing greater encroachment of the neural foramina. The lower lumbar segments also tend to have a greater incidence of spondylosis and degenerative disc disease, leading to an even greater predisposition to spinal stenosis and nerve root impingement.

Though the majority of individuals over the age of 60 have some degree of spinal stenosis, most of these patients are also asymptomatic. The exact incidence of spinal stenosis is, therefore, difficult to determine.
