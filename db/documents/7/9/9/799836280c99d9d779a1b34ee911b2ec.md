The outcome depends on the degree of neurological deficit and symptoms. In most patients, the pulsatile tinnitus can be cured by closing the fistula. Both the seizures and visual problems can improve significantly after therapy.

Higher grades (Borden types II and III, Cognard types IIb-V) have an annual mortality rate of approximately 10%Â and an annual risk of intracranial hemorrhage of approximately 8%. Non-hemorrhagic neurological deficits have an annual risk of approximately 7%.
