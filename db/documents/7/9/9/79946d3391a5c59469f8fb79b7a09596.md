Approximately two-thirds of patients with oral lichen planus are symptomatic, presenting with alternating periods of exacerbation and quiescence.

There are six clinical subtypes of OLP: reticular, papular, plaque, atrophic, erosive, and bullous.

The most common presentations are the reticular, erosive, and plaque subtypes. Reticular OLP has the most characteristic manifestation and displays a white lacy network (Wickham striae) with hyperkeratotic plaques.

OLP typically has a bilateral distribution and most commonly appears on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and gingiva, followed by the labial mucosa and the lower lip.
