Trastuzumab is known to cause cardiotoxicity, usually manifested as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The exact pathogenesis of this event is unknown but may involve decreased clearance of reactive oxygen species in cardiac myocytes.

Severe infusion reactions have been observed upon administration of trastuzumab. These may include angioedema, anaphylaxis, interstitial pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Trastuzumab also carries an FDA boxed warning to this effect. Most severe events have occurred within 24 hours of the initial infusion. All patients should be monitored for significant dyspnea, hypotension, or signs of angioedema; trastuzumab should be discontinued if these are observed. Some, but not all, patients have tolerated re-treatment after pre-medication (e.g., with acetaminophen and/or diphenhydramine).

Rare cases of nephrotic syndrome have been associated with trastuzumab, with the greatest incidence in patients with metastatic gastric cancer.

Other adverse effects commonly reported with trastuzumab monotherapy include:

- Headache

- Chills

- Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting; abdominal pain, diarrhea)

- Cough

- Back pain

- Upper respiratory symptoms (rhinitis, pharyngitis)

- Weakness and fatigue
