The cerebellum is organized into:

- primary sensorimotor region- anterior, part of lobule VI,

- secondary sensorimotor, lobule VIII

- cognitive and limbic region-posterior lobe, lobule VI-VIIA/B

The posterior vermis represents the limbic cerebellum. The corticopontocerebellar and cerebellothalamocortical loops connect the cerebellum to the motor and limbic tracts in the brain, any damage to these loops disrupts complex tasks involved in cognition, mood, and sensorimotor coordination.Â Complex white matter tracts involved include vestibulocerebellar, and vestibulospinal (cerebellar oculomotor systems).

The cerebellum coordinates the function of agonist and antagonist movements required for specific alternating movements. This altered coordination forms the basis for dysdiadochokinesia in cerebellar injury or dysfunction.
