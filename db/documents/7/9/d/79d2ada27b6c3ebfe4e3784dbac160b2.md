Many conditions present similarly, and the clinician will need to rule these out to determine the final diagnosis of ischial bursitis. X-ray imaging of the hip and lumbar spine may help rule out referred pain from these regions from degenerative joint disease, arthritis, or other conditions. A physical exam will help differentiate ischial bursitis from muscle-related causes for the pain, whether it is a tear of the muscle body or other conditions.
