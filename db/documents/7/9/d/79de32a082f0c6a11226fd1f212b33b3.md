Multiple imaging modalities can be useful to determine the mass characteristics and origin. Ultimately, due to the complexity of histological evaluation of cardiac masses, most of these tumors, unless removed, will not be diagnosed with certainty.

The following imaging techniques are mostly used to determine cardiac masses:

**Echocardiogram**

EKG is an important imaging technique that is likely to be the one that makes the diagnosis of the cardiac tumor. Sensitivity and specificity are as high as 90%

It can be performed easily at the bedside, and if further detail is necessary, the use of transesophageal echocardiogram can help to determine further characteristics and location of the cardiac tumor.

This modality can determine, size, mobility, and extension of the tumor and relation with neighboring structures and to determine dynamics relates to the mass as obstructions or valvular insufficiency.

The use of transesophageal echocardiogram can also increase the visualization of small tumors not clear in the transthoracic echocardiogram.

Contrast echocardiography is also useful to differentiate between cardiac tumor versus cardiac thrombus.

Three-dimensional echocardiography is an additional feature to determine the dimensions, shape, and structural involvement of the tumor.

**Cardiac MRI**

Cardiac MRI an excellent imaging modality to determine tumor size, location, adjacent structures to determine an approach for surgical removal.

Assessment of T1 and T2 signals can help to determine the composition of the mass.

The use of contrast, similarly as in echocardiogram, can evaluate the presence of cardiac thrombus versus a tumor.

**CT Scan**

This imaging study is useful for the assessment of cardiac mass, adjacent structure and can determine the nature of the mass by evaluating the x-ray attenuation.

Calcification of the mass is also visible with this imaging study, and it can also evaluate small masses.

**Left Heart Catheterization with Coronary Angiogram**

Left cardiac catheterization can be helpful to determine the blood supply and adjacent structures to the tumors.

**Biopsy and Histological Evaluation**

In vivo intracardial biopsy is a risky procedure mostly done at high volume centers with experienced surgeons.

Right-sided tumors are more likely to be biopsied to determine the histology of the tumor.

Left-sided tumor biopsy has more risk for perforation and systemic embolization during the procedure.

Imaging-guided biopsy increases the success rate of a biopsy and also provides a good tissue specimen for the determination of histological origin.

Cytology from the pericardial fluid can also be used to determine the underlying nature of tumors.

Ultimately, surgical resection of the tumor with histological evaluation and fluoroscopy is used to determine the type of tumor.
