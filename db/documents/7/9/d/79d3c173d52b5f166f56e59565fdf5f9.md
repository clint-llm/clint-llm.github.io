Cardiac amyloidosis is one of the leading causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy. It typically presents with rapidly progressive diastolic dysfunction in a non-dilated ventricle. It is one of the under-diagnosed disease entities. The diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis requires a high degree of suspicion, with cardiovascular imaging being pivotal in reaching the diagnosis. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of different types of cardiac amyloidosis and helps decide the treatment modality and determining disease prognosis; it further emphasizes the need for an interprofessional team to diagnose and manage cardiac amyloidosis, including cardiologists, cardiovascular imaging specialists, heart and transplant specialists, and hematologists.

**Objectives:**
- Describe infiltrative cardiomyopathy and the pathophysiology of cardiac amyloidosis. 
- Summarize clinical findings of cardiac amyloidosis, giving examples of different types of cardiac amyloidosis. 
- Review the echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) findings of cardiac amyloidosis. 
- Explain the management options and their prognosis for different types of cardiac amyloidosis.
