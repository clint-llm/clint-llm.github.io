Providers should monitor patients taking levofloxacin for crystalluria, signs and symptoms of tendonitis, disordered glucose regulation, altered mental status, white blood cells, and signs of infections.

During treatment, it is also essential to periodically evaluate organ system functions (hepatic, renal). It is also necessary to monitor for evidence of bleeding because of the drug interaction of levofloxacin with warfarin, which acts on the CYP2C9 enzyme and raises warfarin levels.

Unlike ciprofloxacin, monitoring patients concurrently taking theophylline is unnecessary as levofloxacin does not inhibit the enzyme CYP1A2.

Monitor complete blood count (CBC) as agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported.
