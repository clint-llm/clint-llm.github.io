Intertrigo is a common inflammatory dermatosis affecting opposing skin surfaces that can result from Candida, under the effect of mechanical and environmental factors. It presents with pain and itching, which decreases the quality of life, leading to high morbidity. Predisposing factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and immunosuppressive conditions, facilitate both the incidence and recurrence of the disease. candidal intertrigo is usually treated with topical application of nystatin and azole group antifungals.

Untreated Candida infection carries the risk of leading to a systemic infection in which other organs can become involved and may lead to sepsis. Intestinal candidiasis can occur as a sequel to oral antibiotic therapy. Bronchopulmonary candidiasis is a rare complication of pre-existing pulmonary disease. Septicemia, endocarditis, and meningitis occur as terminal complications in immunosuppressive and leukemic patients. In leukemia patients, systemic candidiasis presents as prolonged neutropenia and fever refractory to the antibiotic.
