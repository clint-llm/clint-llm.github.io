There are three major categories of indications for proceeding with a BKA. These include urgent cases where source control of necrotizing infections or hemorrhagic injuries outweighs limb preservation. These operations are performed when death is imminent and may sometimes necessitate bedside operation if there is insufficient time to reach the operative suite.

Definitive source control with debridement is critical if there is time to optimize a patient. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are an important adjunct to operative treatment in these cases, limiting morbidity associated with a systemic bacterial infection.

Urgent BKAs mayÂ be performed where limb salvage has failed to preserve a mangled lower extremity.

Finally, elective BKAs may be appropriate in non-septic patients suffering from extensive nonhealing tissue loss, multiple distal to mid-foot amputations with persistent infection, unreconstructable vascular insufficiency with a nonhealing ulcer, or lack of distal foot/ankle function with refractory pain.
