The differential diagnosis for bone metastases depends on the bone involved, but  includes a primary bone sarcoma, multiple myeloma, primary malignant lymphoma of the bone,  secondary or post-radiation sarcoma, and osteomyelitis.

A distinction between acute osteoporotic fractures versus metastatic fractures should be made on radiographic imaging. In osteoporosis, the cortical bone may be preserved; however, cortical bone destruction is typical with metastatic cancer.
