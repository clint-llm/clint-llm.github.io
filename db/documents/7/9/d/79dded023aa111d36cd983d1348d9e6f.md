Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) aims to optimize the physiology involved in wound healing by applying sub-atmospheric pressure to help reduce inflammatory exudate and promote granulation tissue. It is primarily utilized to treat complex wounds which are non-healing or at risk of non-healing, such as diabetic foot ulcers or skin grafts. All medical personnel can implement NPWT; however, specific training and a sufficient level of expertise must be obtained prior to application. This activity outlines the background information and practical application of NPWT and explains the role of the healthcare team in managing patients who undergo NPWT.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy and physiology behind negative pressure wound therapy.
- Identify the indications and contraindications of negative pressure wound therapy.
- Summarize how to apply a negative pressure wound dressing to appropriate wounds.
- Explain the clinical significance of negative pressure wound therapy.
