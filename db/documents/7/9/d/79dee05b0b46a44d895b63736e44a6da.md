PICC lines can differ in size (50 cm to 60 cm), the number of lumens (single to triple), and care and maintenance routines. Additionally, they can be valved or non-valved. Valved catheters prevent backflow of blood into the catheter when the system is open.

Different brands of catheters may have subtle differences in their packaging and equipment. The modified Seldinger technique is by far the most widely used method for PICC placement. Below is a general list of standard equipment when using the modified Seldinger technique:

- Ultrasound and sterile probe sheath cover with ultrasound gel

- Sterile gloves and gown, mask with face shield and hair cover

- Sterile drape and towels

- Skin cleansing solution (chlorhexidine/alcohol)

- Sterile saline flushes

- Tape measure

PICC insertion kit

- PICC catheter

- Needles of varying gauges

- 10 mL syringes

- Guidewire

- Dilator

- Introducer

- Small blade

- Local anesthetic (usually lidocaine)

- Suture material

- Sterile dressing kit (typically transparent and semipermeable)
