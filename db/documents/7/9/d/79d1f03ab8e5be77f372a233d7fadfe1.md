Once the diagnosis is made, the patient should be counseled on what that means, why they experience the symptoms, and that the etiology is not well-understood at present.

The patient should be directed and encouraged to engage with self-help and the local support groups, such as those offered by the Interstitial Cystitis Association (https://www.ichelp.org/) in the United States, as well as Bladder Health UK, or PainUK in the United Kingdom. Some patients that have used self-help found that it is a very effective treatment option.

There are many treatments for the condition, with variable results. It can take up to months before the patient notices an improvement, and the effects may be only marginal. They need to be explained that the condition may not be cured, and symptoms may return at any time. However, with the right treatment, there can be significant improvements in their symptoms and quality of life for the right patient.
