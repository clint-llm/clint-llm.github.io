The common fibular nerve normally splits into the superficial fibular nerve and the deep fibular nerve within the fibular tunnel, which is formed laterally by the deep fascia, medially by the fibular head, and anteriorly and posterior by the origin of the fibularis longus off the fibular head and fibular shaft.

The superficial fibular nerve runs within the FLM, providing a motor function to the FLM and FBM. Approximately 12cm above the ankle joint, the superficial fibular nerve pierces through the deep (crural) fascia of the leg and splits into the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve (MDN) and intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve (IDN).

The deep peroneal nerve supplies the muscles of the anterior leg compartment.
