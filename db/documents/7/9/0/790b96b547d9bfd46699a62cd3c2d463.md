Latanoprost is a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved eye drop formulation to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. It is a prostaglandin F2 alpha analog. It reduces IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor by improving the uveoscleral outflow.

Prostaglandins are most commonly used as the first line of treatment in glaucoma due to their efficacy in reducing the IOP, convenient once-daily dosing, and acceptable safety profile. Latanoprost is the first prostaglandin analog approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The drug was FDA approved for ocular use in 1996.

Latanoprost is used off-label for different variants of glaucoma, including

- Pediatric glaucoma

- Chronic angle-closure glaucoma

- Normal-tension glaucoma

- Steroid-induced glaucoma

- Pigmentary glaucoma

In addition, the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of netarsudil/latanoprost was approved by the USFDA in March 2019 for open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT).
