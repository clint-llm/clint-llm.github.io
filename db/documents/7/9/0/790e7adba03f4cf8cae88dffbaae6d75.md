Production of cerumen (earwax) is a normal and naturally occurring process. It protects the ear from infection and provides a barrier to insects and water. Cerumen is typically expelled from the ear canal spontaneously via natural jaw movement. However, this self-cleaning mechanism fails in certain individuals, and cerumen can become impacted. Excessive buildup of cerumen is likely underdiagnosed and undertreated. It is most often diagnosed by direct visualization by a trained clinician using an otoscope but may require more complex equipment, such as an operating microscope, for removal. This activity describes the pathophysiology of cerumen impaction, reviews the technique involved in cerumen removal, and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cerumen impaction.
- Summarize the techniques available to remove cerumen.
- Outline the complications associated with the removal of cerumen.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes for patients with cerumen impactions.
