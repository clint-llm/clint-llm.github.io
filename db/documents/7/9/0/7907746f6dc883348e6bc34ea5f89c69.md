Myofunctional therapy is essential for restoring the function of the genioglossus muscle after surgery or trauma or nerve injury.

The literature shows that a cervical trauma (whiplash) can negatively influence the function of the tongue and osteopathic treatment can restore the lingual function.

To assess the tension and tone of the tongue, it is possible to use a glove and a gauze and to pull the tongue out (passive protrusion), or put a finger to the side, above and below the tongue when it is protracted, to check its strength and any compensations (with the neck, eyes, or the jaw).
