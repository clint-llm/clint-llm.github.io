Isoflurane is a volatile anesthetic approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Like most volatile anesthetics, isoflurane is a halogenated ether compound that is a structural isomer to its predecessor, enflurane and has been approved for use in the United States since 1979. Unlike enflurane, isoflurane is a non-flammable volatile anesthetic but carries a strong, pungent odor that makes it difficult to use for inhalational induction of general anesthesia. This activity covers isoflurane, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of anesthesia with isoflurane.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of isoflurane.
- Review the importance of minimum alveolar concentration when using isoflurane for anesthesia.
- Explain the contraindication to isoflurane use in anesthesia.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and efficacy for patients receiving anesthesia with isoflurane.
