Neutrophilia is defined as a higher neutrophil count in the blood than the normal reference range of absolute neutrophil count. Neutrophilia can be seen in infections, inflammation, and/or neoplastic processes. Further evaluation is often necessary. An absolute neutrophil count (ANC), defined as the percent of neutrophils in the bloodstream and adults, typically ranges between 2500 to 7000 neutrophils/microL. An increase in the WBC count of more than 11,000 cells/microL is defined as leukocytosis. Neutrophilia is the most common type of leukocytosis and is defined as an increase in the absolute neutrophil count of approximately more than 7700 neutrophils/microL (11,000 cells/microL x 70 percent), i.e., two standard deviations above the mean. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, causes, evaluation, and treatment of neutrophilia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with neutrophilia.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of neutrophilia.
- Identify the etiologies of neutrophilia.
- Describe the common physical exam findings in patients with neutrophilia.
- Outline how an interprofessional team can coordinate care to treat patients with neutrophilia and obtain the best outcomes.
