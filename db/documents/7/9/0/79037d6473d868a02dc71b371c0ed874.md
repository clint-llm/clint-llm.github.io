Prevention is the best strategy for stress fractures. Address both intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Extrinsic factors are the easiest to address. Optimization of calcium and vitamin D status, proper shoe wear, a gradual increase in training volumes, choosing appropriate running surfaces, and smoking cessation. The intrinsic risk factors are more difficult to modify, but a proper understanding of how they can be additive to the extrinsic risk factors will be important in the overall prevention picture for an athlete. Some of the risk factors like poor physical conditioning, hormonal and menstrual disorder, decreased bone mineral density, and lower body muscle mass can be modified. Other like female sex, genu valgum, and maybe leg length discrepancy cannot be modified but should be taken into account when discussing training volumes.
