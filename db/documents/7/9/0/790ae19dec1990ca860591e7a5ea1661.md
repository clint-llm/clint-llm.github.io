Orf disease, also known as ecthyma contagiosum or contagious pustular dermatitis, is an occupational disease acquired from infected sheep and goats. Typically, transmission occurs when a person has an area of skin trauma that comes into contact with an infected goat or sheep. Although this condition is generally self-limiting and does not require specific treatment, diagnosing it early will allow measures to prevent it from spreading to other animals and workers, thereby allowing for the maintenance of productivity and decreased associated morbidity. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of orf disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of orf disease.
- Summarize the typical clinical course of orf infection in a human.
- Review the most common complications associated with orf disease.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care and prevent unnecessary testing for patients affected by orf disease.
