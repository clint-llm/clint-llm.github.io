Candidiasis is more prevalent in old age and infancy. In the US, about 37% of newly born babies may be affected by thrush during the first few months of life. Children using inhaled steroids also have a higher incidence of oral candidiasis. In women, it is common during pregnancy. Thrush may be the first indication of HIV infection. Thrush is universal and is more frequent in populations with poorly nourishment. Thrush occurs equally in males and females.

Although Candida albicans is the most prevalent etiology of candidiasis, there has been a significant increase in non-Candida species in recent times. It is important to know about non-albicans species as the treatment depends on that, and certain medications like commonly used Non-albicans Candida may be resistant to fluconazole. Among the Candida species, C. albicans was the most common species (42/95; 44.21%), followed by C. lusitaniae (18/95; 18.95%), C. parapsilosis (13/95; 13.69%), C. glabrata (8/95; 8.42%), C. kefyr (6/95; 6.31%), C. famata (5/95; 5.26%), C. africana (2/95; 2.11%), and C. orthopsilosis (1/95; 1.05%), respectively.
