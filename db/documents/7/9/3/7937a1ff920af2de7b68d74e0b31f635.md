The etiology of nerve agent toxicity is primarily environmental exposure. Patients can be exposed to nerve agents through agriculture and bioterrorism. Organophosphates and carbamates found in many insecticides commonly cause toxicity in agricultural and industrial workers. Synthetic nerve agents like soman, tabun, sarin, and VX have been used in bioterrorism in the past and present. Soman is a volatile liquid nerve agent originally developed by the Germans in World War II but was never used in warfare. VX is a synthetic nonvolatile liquid nerve agent and was most famously used recently in the assassination of Kim Jong Un's half-brother Kim Jong Nam in February of 2017. The Germans also synthesized tabun in World War II, and during the Nuremberg trials post-war, a military officer admitted to conspiring to assassinate Adolf Hitler in his bunker with Tabun. Sarin is highly volatile, and death from respiratory paralysis can occur in as little as 1 to 10 minutes. Sarin was used in the 1995 Tokyo subway attack killing 12 people
