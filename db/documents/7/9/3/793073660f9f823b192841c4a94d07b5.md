Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS) is a rare, benign skin disorder characterized by asymptomatic, erythematous papular, or plaque-like eruptions. These eruptions, usually located on the face and trunk, have an indolent course before resolving spontaneously or with medical treatment. Lesions can be solitary or numerous, and recurrence is frequent, whether in the original site or previously unaffected areas. The cause of this disorder remains unknown, and there is still debate about whether this disease is a unique entity or part of a spectrum of cutaneous disorders. This activity reviews the histopathology, evaluation, and differential diagnoses of this condition and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the histopathology of Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS).
- Review possible etiology and risk factors for developing Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS). 
- Describe the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS).
- Outline the differential diagnoses of Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS).
