There are multiple separate subsets of ulcerations that can and should be considered. Certain malignancies can also present similarly, and further evaluation should often be considered. Various types/conditions of ulcerations are:

- Venous stasis ulceration

- Arterial ulceration

- Traumatic ulcerations

- Decubitus ulceration

- Skin cancers

- Hypertensive ulceration

- Burns

- Cutaneous infectious diseases

- Chemotoxic or drug-induced ulceration

- Side effects of treatment

- Side effects of comorbidities (i.e., Kaposi's sarcoma)

These must be evaluated for life or limb-threatening conditions such as gas gangrene and necrotizing fasciitis.
