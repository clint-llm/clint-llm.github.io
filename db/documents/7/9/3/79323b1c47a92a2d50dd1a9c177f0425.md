MRIs may identify the same findings as a CT scan. An MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram) is a noninvasive imaging study useful when evaluating the biliary ducts. It can detect bile duct stones, strictures and neoplasms as small as several millimeters. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) is an invasive procedure that is also used to diagnose stones, strictures, and neoplasms of the biliary system. This procedure can also be used to treat and make a more definitive diagnosis by using biopsies, placing stents and removing retained bile duct stones. This does, however, add the risk of iatrogenic complications such as pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasonography is another procedure that allows good visualization of the bile ducts and pancreatic head.
