TachypneaÂ does not necessarily have a pathological cause. For example, exercise can cause tachypnea. Some pathological causes of tachypnea are sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory issues such as pneumonia, carbon monoxide poisoning, pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Other medical issues such as allergic reactions, anxiety states, and foreign body aspiration can also cause tachypnea.
