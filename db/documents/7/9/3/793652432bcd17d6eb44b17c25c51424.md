There is an absence of level I evidence-based treatment for those suffering from Lhermitte's sign, given the vast number of etiologies causing the condition. LS rarely elicits severe pain and discomfort as it is usually a benign finding and self-resolves. Treatment of the underlying condition, like in MS, and surgically addressing any of the compressive anatomical causes are recommended. Few reports and anecdotal evidence show that carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and gabapentin may benefit some patients.

Interestingly, a case series demonstrated that the use of extracranial picotesla range pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) effectively treated patients with Lhermitte's sign. One theory is that the reduction of axonal excitability occurs through the modulation of ionic membrane permeability. The second theory involves modulating pain control systems through neurotransmitter activity and pineal melatonin functions, as discussed earlier.
