Hypopigmented macules are one of the most common skin lesions encountered in clinical practice. As the name suggests, these lesions are associated with decreased pigmentation compared to surrounding normal skin. Hypopigmentation/Hypomelanosis is because of decreased melanin production which can be attributed to various steps involved in melanin synthesis. Most often, the conditions associated with hypomelanosis are benign, rarely associated with systemic diseases (disorders of internal viscera), and malignancy. The cosmetic desire and social stigma (especially in black colored people as it appears more prominent) renders patients to seek treatment. This article reviews the mechanism of melanin production, and the role of the interprofessional team in diagnosing the hypopigmented macules, their etiology, histopathology, and management of commonly encountered hypopigmented macules.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of hypopigmented macules.
- Describe the pathophysiology of hypopigmented macules.
- Summarize the treatment of hypopigmented macules.
