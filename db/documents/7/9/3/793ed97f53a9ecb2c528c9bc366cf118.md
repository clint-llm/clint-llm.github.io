The prevention and treatment of influenza are with an interprofessional team that includes a nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist, an emergency department physician, and an infectious disease specialist. The key is patient educations. All patients should be encouraged to get the annual flu vaccine that is available in November of each year.  While the flu vaccine is not 100% effective, it can lower the intensity and duration of symptoms in most people. Individuals who have lung disease, diabetes, chronic illnesses, the elderly, and children should get the flu vaccine as it can prevent admission to the hospital. Every year, hundreds of individuals are admitted to the hospital, and tragically some do die from the flu.
