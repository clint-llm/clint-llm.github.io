There were two major randomized trials comparing ECMO and conventional mechanical ventilation for refractory hypoxemia in severe ARDS patients. The first trial was published in 2009, which is the CESAR (Conventional ventilatory Support versus Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure) study.

Though the CESAR trial results were encouraging for ECMO, limitations existed, such as not all the patients in the ECMO group received ECMO, and there was a lack of standardization in the use of mechanical ventilation in the control group which resulted in another trial called the EOLIA in 2018.

EOLIA (ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in severe ARDS) trialÂ was a multicenter randomized study designed to determine if early initiation of ECMO would change outcomes in patients with the most severe form of ARDS compared to conventional mechanical ventilation alone.
