Oxygen administration may be initiated for a variety of reasons. Increased metabolic demand, maintenance of oxygenation while providing anesthesia, supplementation during treatment of lung illnesses that affect oxygen exchange, treatment of headaches, carbon monoxide exposure are a few examples for its initiation. Oxygen is necessary for basic metabolic demand in the body, and it is an important part of resuscitation in many acute illnesses, as well as maintenance of chronic hypoxemic diseases. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with hypoxemia and related conditions. This activity discusses the interprofessional evaluation and treatment of patients needing oxygen therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the routes of administration, indications for, and complications of oxygen administration, as well as potential side effects and situations in which oxygen administration is contraindicated.
- Outline patient populations that benefit from oxygen administration.
- Review the considerations of oxygen administration.
- Summarize the most appropriate oxygen administration modalities for select patients and describe the role of the interprofessional team in appropriate treatment.
