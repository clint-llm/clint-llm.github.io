Aphasia is most commonly seen in patients who have had a cerebrovascular accident but can be seen in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, etc.), vascular dementia, brain tumor, or traumatic brain injury.

Aphasia is not secondary to damage to motor or sensory function. It is not a result of peripheral motor or sensory difficulties including paralysis affecting the speech muscles or general hearing impairment.
