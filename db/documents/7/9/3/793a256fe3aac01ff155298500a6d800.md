The following should be considered in the differential for erythrasma:

- Seborrheic dermatitis

- Inverse psoriasis

- Candidiasis

- Dermatophytosis

- Tinea versicolor

- Parapsoriasis

- Pityriasis Rotunda

Seborrheic dermatitis involves greasy and erythematous lesions along the scalp and nasolabial folds. Inverse psoriasis has a shiny appearance. The coral-red fluorescence with Wood's lamp exam helps distinguish erythrasma from seborrheic dermatitis and inverse psoriasis. KOH prep may be required to distinguish erythrasma from dermatophytosis of the toe webs. Erythrasma of the groin is easily distinguished from tinea cruris due to the scaling border of tinea cruris.
