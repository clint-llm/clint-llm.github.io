Healthcare professionals who prescribe medications that work on the autonomic system must be fully aware of the side effects of these agents. Requisite close monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and the temperature is strongly recommended when attempting to reestablish autonomic homeostasis with ANS agents.

- Glaucoma – ocular telemetry sensors can help to continuously monitor intraocular pressure.

- Shock – requires several monitoring functions as listed: 

- Maintaining a MAP of 65 and above
- MAP measurements via an arterial line
- Pulse pressure variation to guide fluid therapy
- Bedside echocardiography to assess chambers of the heart and looking for cardiogenic shock vs. obstructive shock (massive PE) and calculate cardiac output/ejection fraction
- Pulse index continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) device which can serve to continuously monitor continuous cardiac output and assess fluid response

- Asthma/COPD – pulmonary function testing is the standard to diagnose and monitor the severity of pulmonary obstruction; can also evaluate the effectiveness of inhaled autonomic agents in reversing obstructive processes

- Arrhythmias – for acute monitoring 4-lead ECG and 12-lead EKG are standard for monitoring tachycardias or bradycardias; if extended monitoring is required extended continuous ambulatory rhythm monitors (ECAM) is the monitoring modality of choice

Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists need to work collaboratively when using medications that interact with the autonomic nervous system to make sure that the pharmacotherapy is safe and effective for each patient. [Level V]
