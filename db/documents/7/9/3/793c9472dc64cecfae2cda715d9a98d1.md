The acquisition of genetic mutations, particularly those that impact protein structure, function, or expression, is a prerequisite for natural selection, particularly if they significantly impact the organism’s phenotype. Mutations can result in either a positive or negative impact on an organism’s fitness. However, most tend to be slightly deleterious and selected against. However, it is important to note that traits which offer high fitness in one environment may be deleterious in others. A mutation’s variable impact on fitness in different environments can lead to speciation. It results in different populations with varying fitness levels in a given context, thereby causing a barrier to reproduction.

Barriers to reproduction between populations are crucial in forming new species, and genetic mutations are ultimately necessary for this to occur. Furthermore, there are vast differences between species in their baseline rate of genetic mutation, which also contributes to natural selection and evolution. For example, RNA viruses have a rate of 10^-3 per base per generation, while humans have a rate of 10^-8 per base per generation.

This evolutionary process is one explanatory mechanism for the tendency of viruses to become rapidly resistant to anti-viral medications. Although mutations serve as the driver of natural selection and evolution, they also contribute to many disease states, cancer formation, and aging.
