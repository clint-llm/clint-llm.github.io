In the event of a suspected navicular fracture, some conditions that may have similar symptoms and presentations include tendinopathy of the posterior tibialis owing to its insertion on the navicular tuberosity, tear of the spring ligament, or separation of an accessory navicular- a relatively common anatomic variant. An MRI can differentiate between a tarsal navicular fracture and one of these conditions. However, it is usually not needed in the initial management as radiographs, and CT-scans readily diagnose most tarsal navicular fractures.
