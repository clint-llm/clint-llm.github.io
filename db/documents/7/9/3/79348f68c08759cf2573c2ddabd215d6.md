Patients with blue rubber bleb syndrome present at birth or in early childhood with multiple blue to violaceous soft compressible nodules on the skin or mucous membranes. They are often born with a "dominant" lesion and develop numerous venous malformations over their lifetime.

Venous malformations can be seen in various locations throughout the body, which makes physical examination difficult. Venous malformations may be located in the heart, spleen, liver, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract. The small bowel is the most common site of gastrointestinal tract involvement; however, lesions can occur anywhere from the mouth to the anus. As a result, patients may present with severe iron deficiency anemia from recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Venous malformations are slow-flow lesions, making them prone to thrombosis. Thrombosis presents as an erythematous, warm swelling that may be tender to palpation.
