The pathophysiology of kyphoscoliosis is dependent on the underlying etiology.

- Postural thoracic kyphosis may be attributed to reversible muscular imbalances that lead to excessive curvature of the thoracic spine.

- In the elderly, a majority of cases of hyperkyphosis (about 60-70%) are not attributed to underlying vertebral compression fractures.

- Similarly to the above, in postinfectious cases, a loss of structural integrity of the anterior column leads to alterations in the capacity of loading forces and results in exaggerated curvature of the spine. There have been cases reported of kyphoscoliosis occurring in 12% of patients with postpolio residual paralysis (PPRP).

- The literature review notes a report of kyphoscoliosis associated with congenital neuromuscular disease with uniform type 1 fibers (CNMDU1) and may be a risk factor for severe progression.
