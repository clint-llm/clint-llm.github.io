The physical examination in most patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia helps practitioners to arrive at a diagnosis. However, investigations like neuroimaging assist in finding the underlying cause. MRI can be a valuable tool in this regard, and up to 75% of patients may have a visible lesion. For demyelinating lesions, proton density imaging is considered to be ideal. Supplementary blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies may be undertaken to detect uncommon causes.
