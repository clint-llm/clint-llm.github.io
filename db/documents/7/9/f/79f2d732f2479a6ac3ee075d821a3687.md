Wound closure is not a painless event, and some anesthesia should be provided. For small wounds, lidocaine with epinephrine will suffice. The addition of epinephrine not only causes vasoconstriction and limits blood loss but also increases the duration of the anesthetic. An additional benefit of epinephrine is that it delays the absorption of anesthetic agents, thus allowing for a larger dose of the particular agent to be administered. However, it is vital not to inject epinephrine around the ears, the tip of the nose, penis, and distal phalanges. Otherwise, tissue necrosis can occur. Bupivacaine is a longer-acting anesthetic agent and can be used in cases requiring anesthesia for a longer period of time due to its long half-life. The clinician must know about the safe dosage of these agents.

- Lidocaine:  4 mg/kg to 4.5 mg/kg

- Lidocaine with epinephrine:   7 mg/kg

- Bupivacaine (with or without epinephrine) (adults only): 175 mg in a single dose or a maximum of 400 mg per 24 hours

It is also important to know when not to close the wound. Some wounds best heal by secondary intention. When the wound is dirty, or there is significant tissue loss, wound closure should be delayed. The immediate closure of animal and human bites is not recommended, and these wounds should be left open as this can lead to florid infection.
