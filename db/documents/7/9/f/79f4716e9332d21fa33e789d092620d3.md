Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare disorders with complex systemic clinical manifestations due to underlying malignancy. In paraneoplastic syndromes, the malignant cells do not directly cause symptoms related to metastasis; rather, they generate autoantibodies, cytokines, hormones, or peptides that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms can manifest before or after the diagnosis of cancer. Prompt recognition of these syndromes is critical as it may reveal hidden malignancy, affecting clinical outcomes. This activity illustrates the evaluation and need for early recognition of paraneoplastic syndromes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with this complex medical condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiologies of the paraneoplastic syndromes.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient for paraneoplastic syndrome.
- Review the treatment options available for paraneoplastic syndromes.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional teams in improving care coordination and outcomes for patients with paraneoplastic syndromes.
