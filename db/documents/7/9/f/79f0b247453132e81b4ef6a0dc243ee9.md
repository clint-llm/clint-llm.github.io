The differential diagnosis of bullous myringitis relies heavily on the clinician’s physical exam.  Bullous myringitis, like AOM, needs to be distinguished from otitis media with effusion (OME) as well as from other bullous dermatologic conditions such as bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris. Bullae must also be distinguished from vesicles, which would suggest a viral origin sich as Ramsay-Hunt syndrome. Other differential diagnoses include acute suppurative otitis media, otitis externa, granuloma, and acute mastoiditis.
