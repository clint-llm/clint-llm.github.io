The differential diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia includes other thoracic lesions such as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, bronchopulmonary sequestration, bronchogenic cysts, bronchial atresia, teratomas. The appearance of intraabdominal contents within the thorax on x-ray differentiates CDH from other lesions. Antenatally, the presence of a stomach bubble and intestinal peristalsis noted within the thorax on ultrasonogram points towards a diagnosis of CDH. Diaphragmatic eventration in which the diaphragm is intact but thin and elevated can be difficult to differentiate from CDH prenatally.
