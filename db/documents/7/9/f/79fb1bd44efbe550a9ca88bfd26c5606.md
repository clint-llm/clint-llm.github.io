Cyanide absorbs quickly through the respiratory tract and mucous membranes as well as the gastrointestinal tract and skin. Signs and symptoms begin at blood cyanide concentrations of approximately 40 mol/L. In vivo, cyanide metabolism and neutralization involve a number of mechanisms. The most important of these is the detoxification of cyanide via rhodanese, an enzyme found abundantly in many tissues but in the liver and muscle particularly. Thiosulfate serves as a sulfur donor in the reaction catalyzed by rhodanese that converts cyanide to thiocyanate, a water-soluble molecule excreted in the urine.
