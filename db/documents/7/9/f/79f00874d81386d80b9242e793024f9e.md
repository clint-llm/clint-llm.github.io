Non-IgM MGUS is considered a preneoplastic condition with an annual risk of progression of approximately 1%. The riskÂ of progression is increased when M protein greater than or equal to 15 g/L and with an abnormal free light chain ratio. Non-IgM MGUS does not require treatment. However, the management of patients with non-IgM MGUS requires an understanding of the risk of progression of the disease. Generally, close follow-up is recommended for these patients. Most providers believe that all non-IgM MGUS patients should undergo a clinical examination and laboratory evaluation for disease progression annually.

- Serum monoclonal protein level greater than or equal to 15 g/L (1.5 g/dL)

- Non-IgG MGUS (i.e., IgA, IgM, and IgD MGUS)

- Abnormal serum free light chain ratio

Patients with three risk factors are categorized as high-risk MGUS; patients with two risk factors are categorized as high-intermediate risk MGUS. Patients with one risk factor are categorized as low-intermediate risk MGUS. Patients with no risk factors are categorized as low-risk MGUS. Despite close observation, some non-IgM MGUS patients may show progression to PCM abruptly.
