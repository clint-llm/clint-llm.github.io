Specific imaging studies are not routinely obtained in the preoperative workup of an inguinal hernia. However, if concerning signs of symptoms as stated above are noted, these findings should prompt preoperative imaging. An ultrasound may demonstrate hydronephrosis of the ipsilateral kidney. Intravenous pyelography may demonstrate the telltale “curlicue” sign, with the ureter seen in a pathognomonic spiral or loop-the-loop formation. In patients with unexpected abnormal renal function, Gellett describes the potential for preoperative diagnosis by computed tomography (CT) with confirmation of a ureteral inguinal hernia on delayed, post-contrast, 3-dimensional reconstruction.
