Epiphora is excessive tearing from one or both eyes. Epiphora is seen in children and adults. In a large epidemiological Scottish study, the prevalence of epiphora was found to be 20% in the first year of life.

The causes of epiphora, what history to obtain, and the clinical examination of patients who present with epiphora has been discussed in detail in our chapter entitled "epiphora." In this chapter, we discuss the tests that are performed when assessing patients with epiphora.
