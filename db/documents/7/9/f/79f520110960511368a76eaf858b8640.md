Disruption of the blood-retinal barrier leads to the development of exudative retinal detachment.

The blood-retinal barrier is divided into two categories: the outer blood-retinal barrier and the inner blood-retinal barrier. The outer blood-retinal barrier is formed by the tight junction between the cells of the retinal pigment epithelium.

No anatomical attachment is present between the retinal pigment epithelium and the neurosensory retina. The apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelial cells has the expression of neural cell adhesion molecules, which help in the attachment between the retinal pigment epithelium and the neurosensory retina.

Normal functioning of the tight junctions of the cells forming the blood-retinal barrier is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the blood-retinal barrier.

Other causes include loss of polarity of retinal pigment epithelium, which causes reversal of pumping and accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space.
