Although rare, cancers, such as squamous cell carcinomas may be present in conjunctionÂ with a Zenker's diverticulum. This is imperative to rule out during an assessment. One must ask about smoking history and consumption of very hot or very cold liquids (teas, coffee). Other differential diagnoses that one must think about is achalasia, GERD or Barrett esophagus, esophagitis (radiation, immunocompromised, STI), stroke in the acute setting, and ulcerations due to retention of food. It is important to be thorough in the evaluation of these patients.
