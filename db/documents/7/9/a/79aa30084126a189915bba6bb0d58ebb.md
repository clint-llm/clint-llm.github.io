The QLB has similar contraindications to other fascia plane blocks, such as the transversus abdominis plane block or the fascia iliaca block. These absolute contraindications include the following

- Patient refusal

- True local anesthetic allergy

- Risk of local anesthetic toxicity; in other words, the patient has already received the maximum recommended local anesthesia dose.

- Local infection at the procedure site

There is controversy about whether the QLB or other plane blocks can be safely performed during a coagulopathy or in a patient receiving anticoagulants.
