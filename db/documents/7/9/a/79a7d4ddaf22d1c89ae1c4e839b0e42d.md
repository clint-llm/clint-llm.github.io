The successful management of hand amputations is only possible through an interprofessional approach during all phases of care.  Protocols must exist and be well-implemented at a systems-level in order to optimize patient outcomes.  It is the role of first-responders and emergency physicians to understand their roles in medical stabilization and timely referral to facilities that are equipped for these injuries.  An appreciation for the time-critical nature of replantation attempts is crucial.  Hand surgeons and their operating room teams must be efficient and prepared, as well as readily available, to optimize outcomes.  The final goal of any treatment, namely restoration of function, cannot be achieved without therapists and rehabilitation specialists who are knowledgeable and diligent in their care.

To summarize, the optimal treatment of hand amputations requires an interprofessional approach involving first-responders, emergency department personnel, experienced surgical teams, and dedicated rehabilitation experts. [Level 4]
