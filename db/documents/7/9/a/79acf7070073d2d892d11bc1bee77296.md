Several points in the history and physical examination of HD as one of the differential diagnoses of neonatal bowel obstruction include (1) abnormal maternal amniotic fluid indexes including polyhydramnios, (2) vomiting and specifically bilious emesis, (3) obstipation, which might present with failure to pass meconium in the first 48 hours of life and (4) abdominal distention. History of colonic obstruction, which might occur during the early neonatal period till adulthood, along with failure to pass meconium during the first 48 hours of life, which presents in up to 90% of the affected patients, is highly compatible with the impression of HD. However, a history of delayed passage of meconium might be present in up to 40% of healthy individuals.

Further important pointers in the history of patients with suspected HD include clinical features of Hirschsprung's associated enterocolitis (HAEC), multiple episodes of overflow constipation, and soft distended abdomen. Rare associations with genetic abnormalities, including trisomy 21 and neurocristopathies like Waardenburg syndrome, have also been reported.
