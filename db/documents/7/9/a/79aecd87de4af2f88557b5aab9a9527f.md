Given the elevated rate of fetal complications, including prematurity and death,Â women with autoimmune hepatitis should be counseled to delay pregnancy until the AIH is under reasonable control for at least one year.

Patients should be counseled to eat a balanced, healthy diet and to avoid becoming obese, as obesity potentially increases the risk of fatty liver disease, which can worsen AIH. Patients should receive counsel to avoid all types of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and liquor because they can all cause fatty liver and additional liver damage. Furthermore, certain herbs can cause severe liver injury, and some have links with triggering AIH. This reaction is why patients should be advised to avoid seeking any herbal treatment for their liver disease.
