Rapid sequence intubation is the standard of care in most emergency department intubations. Both rapid sequence intubation and medication-facilitated intubation are carried out by emergency medical service agencies in the United States. More studies are needed to determine if rapid sequence intubation should be the standard of care in the prehospital environment as well. As discussed, limited studies thus far indicate an improved intubation success rate when rapid sequence intubation is performed compared to medication-facilitated intubation for emergency airway management.
