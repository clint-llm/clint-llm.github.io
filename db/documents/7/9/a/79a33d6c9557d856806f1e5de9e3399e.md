Thoracic ultrasound isÂ sometimes performed by the emergency department physician, internist, intensivist or nurse practitioner to look for pleural fluid or aspiration of a fluid collection from the chest cavity. It is important that that only professionals trained in ultrasound use this technique. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, a radiologist should be consulted first before inserting any tube or needle in the chest cavity. Once the fluid is removed, a chest x-ray is recommended to ensure that there is no pneumothorax.
