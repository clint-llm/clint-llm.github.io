Investigations may include:

- Urgent frozen sections of skin biopsy: full-thickness skin necrosis

- Direct immune fluorescence: negative

- Complete blood count (CBC): anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis

- Liver function tests (LFT): elevated transaminases, hypoalbuminemia

- Renal function: microalbuminuria, renal tubular enzymes in urine, reduced glomerular filtration, rising creatinine and urea, hyponatremia

- Pulmonary function: bronchial mucosal sloughing on bronchoscopy, interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray

- Cardiac function: abnormal ECG and imaging.

The severity of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is assessed using SCORTEN. One point is scored for each of the following seven criteria at admission.

- Age  older than 40 years

- Presence of a malignancy

- Heart rate of more than 120 bpm

- Initial percentage of epidermal detachment greater than 10%

- Serum urea level greater than 10 mmol/L

- Serum glucose level greater than 14 mmol/L

- Serum bicarbonate level less than 20 mmol/L

The risk of dying from Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis depends on the score. The mortality rate is more than 40 times higher in those with bicarbonate levels less than 20 mmol/L compared with those with higher levels.  A SCORTEN ranges with their associated mortality (in %) are as follows: score 0-1 (3.2%), score 2 (12.1%), score 3 (35.3%), score 4 (58.3%), and score 5 (>90%).

In patients on multiple drugs known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, the algorithm ALDEN has been developed to determine the likely cause.

- The period between drug intake and the onset of reaction (index day): 5 to 28 days (score of 3), 29 to 56 days (2), 1 to 4 days (1), more than 56 days (–1), index day (–3) for the first episode;  1 to 4 days (score of 3), 5 to 56 days (1) for a subsequent episode

- Presence of drug on index day or within five times elimination half-life: stopped (1), unknown (0), stopped earlier (–1), continued beyond index day (–2)

- Previous history of adverse reaction to the same drug: Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (4), Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis to a similar drug (2), other reaction to same or similar drug (1), none (0), previous use without reaction (–2)

- The notoriety of the drug, according to SCAR study: high risk (3), lower risk (2), possible risk (1), under surveillance or new drug (0), no evidence of association (–1)

- Other possible cause: infection (–1), another drug that high risk (–1 for each other drug)
