Interprofessional team involvement is essential in preventing and treating renal mass. With the guidance of dietitians and physical therapists, patients can appreciate diet and weight loss for their overall health and reduce malignant renal mass risk.

Primary care providers and nurses need to reinforce the importance of follow-up, medication compliance, and cessation of alcohol and cigarettes. Furthermore, urologists and oncologists, along with primary care providers and pharmacists, can optimize treatment guidance and interventions while reducing complications. By collaboration and communication, an interprofessional team will offer improved delivery care for patients with renal masses.
