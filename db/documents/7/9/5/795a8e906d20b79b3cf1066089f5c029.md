The treatment of a pectoralis major tear depends on the severity of the injury and the anticipated use of the injured muscle based on the activity level of the patient (e.g., an athlete involved in competitive sports versus a sedentary individual performing activities of daily living). The treatment of choice for complete tears is generally operative. Initial non-operative treatment involves rest, ice, analgesia, and immobilization in a sling with the arm adducted and internally rotated.
