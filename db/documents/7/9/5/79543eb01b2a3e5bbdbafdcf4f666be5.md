The best diagnostic test to confirm gallbladder disease is the abdominal ultrasound. It is noninvasive and is 90% to 95% accurate in detecting gallstones. Pericholic fluid and thickened gallbladder walls can also be identified as in acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder sludge and occasionally common bile duct stones can also be seen with abdominal ultrasounds.

The gallbladder ultrasound may also be useful in detecting possible gallbladder neoplasms.

The EUS or endoscopic ultrasound is not a first-line test for diagnosing gallbladder disease. There is no place for it as a diagnostic tool for cholecystitis. It is useful when evaluating and staging tumors of the gallbladder, pancreas, and bile ducts. Biopsies can also be done for tissue diagnosis.
