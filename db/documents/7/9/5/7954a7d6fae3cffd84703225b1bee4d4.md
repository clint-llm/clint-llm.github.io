Pityriasis alba is a self-limited infection and has a good prognosis. Complete repigmentation is the norm in most people. The key issue is the cosmetic deficit for which patients often seek medical help. Also, there is a risk of sunburn in areas of hypopigmentation. The skin disorder may last a few days or a few years. In some cases, the treatment may shorten the duration of the disorder.
