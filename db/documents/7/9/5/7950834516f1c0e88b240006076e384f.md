Synovial chondromatosis (SC) is a benign uncommon condition of the synovial membrane of joints, tendon sheaths, and bursae that can result in severe disability and dysfunction of an involved synovial joint. Observation of involved cases indicates that this benign condition rarely undergoes malignant transformation; however, transformation to chondrosarcoma is a possible complication.

The initial diagnosis is made through a thorough history, physical examination, and radiological evaluation of an affected joint. These joints usually present as having a large effusion and sometimes appear deformed due to swelling or synovial hypertrophy. They are painful at rest and are more painful with motion. The range of motion is usually decreased. X-ray evaluation reveals multiple loose radio-opaque chondroid bodies of varied sizes in a joint. MRI arthrogram enables better evaluation of the process and the extent of involvement within the joint and surrounding tissue. Synovial chondromatosis is usually monoarticular, although rare cases of multiple joint involvements occur. The process may occur in two forms: primary synovial chondromatosis (also referred to as synovial osteochondromatosis, synovial chondrosis, Reichel syndrome, or synovial chondrometaplasia) and secondary synovial chondromatosis).
