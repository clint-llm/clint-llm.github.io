Prior to initiating golimumab, a test for active or latent tuberculosis (TB) should be performed by tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-γ release assay (IGRA). Patients should also be routinely monitored throughout treatment for TB after starting therapy with golimumab. Subjects with latent TB should be treated prior to initiating golimumab. Patients should also receive a baseline complete blood count (CBC) and routinely thereafter. Patients with an active infection should not be started on golimumab. Monitoring for any bacterial, viral, fungal, or opportunistic infections while on treatment is also advised.

Liver function tests should also be checked regularly as elevated liver enzymes: alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase are reported adverse effects. Patients with underlying CHF receiving golimumab should have regular check-ups for worsening CHF. Subjects with underlying HBV receiving therapy with golimumab should be assessed at baseline and regularly thereafter for HBV reactivation. In the event of viral reactivation, golimumab should be halted, and appropriate treatment should be initiated.
