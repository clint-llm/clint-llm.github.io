Fatal outcomes have occurred with overdoses at as low as 1000 mg. Signs and symptoms of overdose include serotonin syndrome, seizures, coma, somnolence,Â syncope, tachycardia, autonomic instability, diarrhea, and vomiting. Signs of serotonin syndrome include agitation, restlessness, disorientation, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, tremor, muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, dilated pupils, dry mucous membranes, and increased bowel sounds. Clonus and hyperreflexia are particularly common in serotonin syndrome.

There is no antidote to duloxetine overdose. If the patient is presenting with serotonin syndrome, cyproheptadine and cooling measures may be considered. Patients with abnormal vital signs need monitoring, and severe cases may warrant ICU-level of care.
