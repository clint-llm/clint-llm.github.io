Retinal tissue can be utilized from post-mortem, enucleated eyes. Following dissection, the retina can undergo fixing via 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, for 10 or 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). They can then be stored in sucrose at −20°C for cryoprotection until use. Once vertically sliced, the retina is visualizable with the use of various lab microscopes.
