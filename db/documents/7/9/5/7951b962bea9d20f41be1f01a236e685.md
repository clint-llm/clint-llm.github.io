Open fractures occur secondary to trauma. They most commonly occur as high-energy injuries, but can also be a result of low-velocity trauma when the sharp ends of the fracture fragments pierce through the skin and soft tissue. High-energy, open fractures are often associated with other life-threatening conditions secondary to poly-trauma and pose other risks such as neurovascular injuries, soft tissue crushing, wound contamination and skin degloving which makes them more likely to have complications.
