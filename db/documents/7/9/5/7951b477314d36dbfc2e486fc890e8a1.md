Fetal echogenic bowel was initially described as a normal variant and a transient fetal finding. The majority of fetuses with an isolated echogenic bowel have normal short-term and long-term neonatal outcomes.

Later, fetal echogenic bowel was reported to be a perinatal ultrasonographic marker for conditions such as cystic fibrosis and trisomy 21. Currently, echogenic bowel has been found to be associated with chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 21, 13, 18), cystic fibrosis, congenital infection (TORCH), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), gastrointestinal malformations (gastric obstruction, atresia, perforation, meconium ileus), placental insufficiency as well as intrauterine and neonatal death.
