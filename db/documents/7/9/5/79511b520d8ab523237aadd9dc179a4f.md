Laboratory findings can include increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, or immunoglobulin levels and leukocytosis or thrombocytosis. There are cases of ICH where laboratory findings are all within normal limits.

Genetic testing, if available, can confirm the presence of the missense mutation but the clinical course and radiographic findings should establish a clinical diagnosis. X-rays show gradual cortical thickening, periosteal bone formation around the diaphysis, and soft tissue swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is consistent with periosteal thickening, low-signal intensity in soft tissues on T1 sequences, and high-signal intensity on T2 sequences. Changes take 15 to 20 days to appear on x-rays, making it difficult to diagnose ICH in the early stages. Abnormal MRI findings may sometimes present before abnormal x-ray films.
