There are many different indications for hand splinting. These include phalanx fractures, conditions requiring immobilization of the metacarpophalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints, metacarpal fractures, thumb strains, and de Quervain syndrome. Some commonly used types of hand splints include dorsal distal phalanx splints, hairpin splints, dynamic finger splints, ulnar gutter splints, radial gutter splints, dorsal splints with extension hoods, and thumb spica splints. If there are open fractures present, an orthopedic referral is needed for evaluation and should not be delayed by splint placement. This activity reviews the indications for hand splints and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for a hand splint.
- Explain how a hand splint is applied.
- Describe potential complications of hand splints. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of hand disorders with hand splints and improve outcomes.
