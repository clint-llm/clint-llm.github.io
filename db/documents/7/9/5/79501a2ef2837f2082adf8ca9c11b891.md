The most common differentials include primary brainstem hemorrhages, which are petechial and hypertensive bleeds. Radiologically, Duret hemorrhage typically has a linear configuration, extending from ventral and dorsal, but may be of any shape in the clinical setting of supratentorial abnormalities leading to transtentorial herniation. Primary hypertensive hemorrhages are usually larger and occur spontaneously in patients with an antecedent history of uncontrolled hypertension, without any supratentorial abnormality. Petechial hemorrhages are multifocal and small, which are seen around dorsal midbrain (periaqueductal and tectum) in cases of diffuse axonal injuries following traumatic brain injury.
