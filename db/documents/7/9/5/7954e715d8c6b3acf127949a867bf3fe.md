Infliximab (IFX) is a biologic agent that specifically targets an immune mediator, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), involved in a pathological process. Anti TNFa agents have enjoyed use as therapeutic modalities since 1998; however, their first use in dermatology dates back to 2002 when they first saw use in the treatment of psoriasis.

Pediatric cases aged six years or older with moderate-to-severe disease that fails to respond to conventional therapy are indications for infliximab.

Ulcerative colitis – Infliximab is prescribed for inducing and maintaining clinical remission and for eliminating corticosteroid therapy in those showing inadequate response.

Pediatric cases 6 years and older are suitable for this mode of treatment.

Rheumatoid arthritis - Patients undergoing infliximab therapy for moderate-to-severe disease have reported inhibition of progressing joint damage and improved physical strength.
