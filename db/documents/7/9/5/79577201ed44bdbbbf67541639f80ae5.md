Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are a class of drugs indicated for the treatment of several inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as for the management of other connective tissue diseases and some cancers. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of DMARDs, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with autoimmune disorders that will respond to such therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the difference between traditional and biological DMARDs.
- Identify the indications for various DMARD agents.
- Outline the adverse effects and contraindications to biologic DMARD therapy.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients when using either traditional or biologic DMARDs.
