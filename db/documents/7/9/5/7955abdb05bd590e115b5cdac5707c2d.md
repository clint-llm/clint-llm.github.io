- The trio of aortic stenosis, gastrointestinal angiodysplasia, and acquired von Willebrand disorder is called Heyde syndrome.

- In an elderly patient with aortic valve stenosis and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, Heyde syndrome should be in the clinician's differential as a potential diagnosis.

- Initial evaluation of Heyde syndrome includes a CBC, coagulation studies, metabolic panel, and test for fecal occult blood.

- The Platelet Function Assay (PFA) is the preferred screening modality to test for acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS), as seen in Heyde syndrome.

- In cases of suspected Heyde syndrome with an abnormal PFA study, VWF multimer analysis is necessary to evaluate for reduced levels of high molecular weight multimers (HMWM).

- In the absence of a specific guideline and accordance with expert consensus, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the first-line recommended therapy for Heyde syndrome.

- The most important complication of Heyde syndrome is recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

- Cardiologist and gastroenterologist consults are recommended in Heyde syndrome.

- In patients with Heyde syndrome who undergo AVR, the prognosis is excellent.
