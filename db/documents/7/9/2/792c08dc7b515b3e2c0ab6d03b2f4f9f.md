Symptoms of adenoid hypertrophy are primarily related to nasal obstruction and Eustachian tube dysfunction. Thus the differential diagnosis should include other causes for these non-specific symptoms, such as:

- Choanal atresia

- Pyriform aperture stenosis

- Allergic rhinitis

- Acute or chronic sinusitis

- Nasal polyposis

- Intranasal encephalocele

- Nasal dermoid

- Nasopharyngeal neoplasm

- Acute otitis media

- Chronic serous otitis media

- Cholesteatoma

- Nasopharyngeal malignancy

- Inverting papilloma

- HIV

The presence of significant and symptomatic adenoid tissue in a young adult or adult should prompt the clinician to more strongly consider neoplastic etiology, as well as other systemic etiologies duch as mononucleosis or HIV.
