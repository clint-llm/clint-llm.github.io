Germline mutations in CDKN1B result in MEN4. In humans, the CDKN1B gene is located on chromosome 12p13.

This mutation in CDKN1B was first identified in rats. Franklin and his coworkers tested their theory that CDKI may work as tumor suppressor genes in mouse models. They found that loss of function of p18 and p27 leads to a wide range of multiple endocrine gland tumors predominantly affecting the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, and parathyroid glands.

In 2006, Pellegata et al. mapped this locus of interest on the distal part of chromosome 4 in rats, including the cdkn1b gene encoding the p27 protein. It has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern in rats. In 2006, the same team reported the first case of MEN4 in humans. They studied a family of 3 generations with negative MEN1 mutation but positive CDKN1B mutation with multiple endocrine neoplasias and renal angiomyolipomas.

In 2008, MENX was renamed MEN4 at the 11th International Workshop on MEN's in Delphi, Greece.
