The history will be relevant to the underlying risk factor responsible for sensory-perceptual alteration. Signs and symptoms can occur at a specific time and place when the patient is exposed to a certain environment or trigger, or it can happen instantaneously without any triggers. Furthermore, the signs and symptoms of sensory and perceptual alteration can occur when the patient is exposed to certain stimuli or environmental factors. Such sensory and perceptual disorders would be magnified in an unfamiliar environment, especially when patients are hospitalized in unfamiliar hospital rooms.

Vital signs can be abnormal or normal, depending upon the etiology of the sensory and visual alterations. Patients may not be oriented to time, place, or person. They can be confused, irritable, exhibit a lack of focus and concentration, unable to solve problems or communicate. They may also be suffering from hallucinations (visual, auditory, or tactile). Depending on the altered perception, cranial nerve and sensory examination may be abnormal. The remaining systems examinations can be expected to be normal orÂ variable according to the patient's condition.
