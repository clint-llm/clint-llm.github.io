It has been shown by several studies that when the surgical cytoreduction is incomplete, there is no longer any benefit from HIPEC on survival.

Medically, in addition to comorbid factors such as severe cardiovascular disorders and serious lung disease, hepatic and renal failure may complicate the procedure and should contraindicate the operation.

Allergy to cytotoxic agents is a formal contraindication to the HIPEC.

The threshold value of the PCI score to perform a HIPEC in the PC of colorectal origin is 20. Indeed, the survival overall at five years is virtually zero for patients with a PCI greater than 20.

Surgically and in addition to a too high PCI score, the invasion of some surgical sites also contraindicates the HIPEC. These are the root of the mesentery, the hepatic pedicle, retroperitoneum, and the bladder. Impairment of small intestinal function that potentially could induce a short bowel syndrome is also a contraindication.

Ultimately, surgical cytoreduction will remove as many tumors as possible, while the associated HIPEC  will make it possible to "sterilize" the tumor residues not visible to the naked eye. The purpose of CHIP is to obtain a high local concentration of chemotherapy and a low systemic concentration.
