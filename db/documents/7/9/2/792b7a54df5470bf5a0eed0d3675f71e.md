Nickel allergy is a type of allergic contact dermatitis. A nickel allergy is commonly encountered with jewelry, kitchen tools, and silverware. In individuals who are sensitive to nickel, ingestions of certain foods (e.g., chocolate, nuts, oats, green beans, peas) may cause systemic nickel allergy syndrome (SNAS) or lead to chronic dermatitis.
