An oral suspension of activated charcoal should be considered in poisonings when gastrointestinal decontamination of an ingested toxin is indicated. Activated charcoal is most efficacious when given within one hour of ingestion of the toxin. Careful consideration of the contraindications should occur before treatment with activated charcoal. This activity covers the indicated uses for activated charcoal and, just as importantly, reviews situations where it is not appropriate. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients who may benefit from activated charcoal.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the clinical situations where activated charcoal use may be beneficial.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of activated charcoal therapy.
- Review the mechanism of action of activated charcoal therapy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies to coordinate care so that proper administering and monitoring of activated charcoal therapy are implemented, in turn improving patient outcomes.
