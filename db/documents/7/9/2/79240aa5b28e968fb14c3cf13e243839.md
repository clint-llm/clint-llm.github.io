Gallstone ileus is one of the rarest forms of all mechanical bowel obstructions and is a complication of cholelithiasis. Patients have non-specific symptoms such as intermittent abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomiting, and constipation as the gallstone travels through the gastrointestinal tract. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of gallstone ileus and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of gallstone ileus.
- Describe the formation of a biliary-enteric fistula in the pathophysiology of gallstone ileus.
