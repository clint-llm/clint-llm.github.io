Patient education is crucial in the management of multiple myeloma. The disease itself is complex, and outcomes can be improved if early and appropriate intervention is undertaken. That said, a patient must be an active participant in shared decision-making to assure improved compliance with therapy.

Another deterrent to positive outcomes seems to be racial disparities. Compared with Whites, African Americans have a higher mortality rate and have not seen the same gains in survival. Although a specific cause has not been identified, there does seem to be less utilization and access to appropriate healthcare and treatment.
