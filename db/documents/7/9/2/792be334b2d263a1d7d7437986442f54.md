Prevention and control of MRSA infections include necessary infection-control steps like strict hand hygiene and adequate contact precautions. Hand hygiene means washing hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based cleanser before and after contact with patients who have MRSA infection. Contact precautions include the use of gowns, gloves, and possibly masks during clinical encounters with patients with MRSA infection. Infection controlÂ also may include keeping patients in isolated rooms or the same rooms of other patients who have an MRSA infection.

Other measures include active surveillance to screen for MRSA colonization by testing for PCR MRSA or cultures of nares, oropharynx, or perineum. If found positive, contact precautions can be instituted for these patients to prevent transmission of MRSA as colonization is considered to be a significant risk factor for MRSA infection.
