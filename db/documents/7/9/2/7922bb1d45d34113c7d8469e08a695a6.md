Patients with cauliflower ear may present to the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, primary care provider or the sports physician. While the diagnosis is simple, the management can be difficult. In acute cases, aspiration is sufficient. The key is to educate the patient on prevention while playing sports. Unfortunately, recurrences are common if not managed appropriately. The cauliflower usually imparts poor aesthetics which cannot be reversed.
