The definitive treatment for cryptogenic cirrhosis is transplantation. However, given the close association between cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH, medical management until transplant may be beneficial. Lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, physical exercise, and a healthy diet are recommended. Although NASH is related to the development of cryptogenic cirrhosis, there are other potential associations as well. Specific treatment for those etiologies is also recommended.
