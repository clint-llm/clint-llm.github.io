Contraindications to use of saphenous vein graft include factors that may compromise the quality of the saphenous vein, including local cellulitis/thrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis, or previous vein stripping/vein manipulation. Also, increased vein branching, varicosities, wall thickness and decreased diameter all confer a higher likelihood of graft failure.
