Pharmacological management of MC is not always indicated,Â and patients should be evaluated by a neurologist to assess the requirement for medication prior to its initiation.

Medications that are used generally aim to reduce hypersensitivity of the muscle membrane by blocking sodium ion flow.

Side effects may include tremor, dizziness, ataxia, and gastrointestinal disturbance. These adverse effects are usually dose-dependent and reversible on cessation of medication or dose decrement. Phenytoin and other anticonvulsants are also commonly used.

Potassium channels are a novel target. The potassium channel activator retigabine has been investigated in murine MC models and demonstrated to significantly improve the severity of myotonia in vivo.
