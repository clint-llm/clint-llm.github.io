For soft tissue tumors requiring MRgUS, MRI is necessary before the procedure; this will help physicians localize the tumor and position the patient for the procedure. Prior imaging will be compared and utilized to position the patient. Musculoskeletal uses of ultrasound therapy require short preparation and include examining the overlying skin for burns, rashes, infections, and active bleeding. Personnel should always inspect equipment before the start of the procedure.
