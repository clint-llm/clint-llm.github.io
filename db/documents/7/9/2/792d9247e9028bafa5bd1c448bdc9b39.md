Luspatercept is a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of activin receptor type IIB fusion protein and the Fc-part of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Luspatercept blocks the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily inhibitors to reduce SMAD2 and SMAD3 signaling. This activity prevents the activation of a variety of TGF-beta superfamily members involved, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis in the late stage.

Another example of a similar drug is sotatercept. These medications fall under erythropoietin modulating agents that help increase effective erythropoietin, which is lacking in conditions like lower-risk MDS, beta-thalassemia, and primary myelofibrosis.
