A diagnostic time-out is recommended with a checklist for reversible causes of coma is recommended.

Basilar artery occlusion or other large vessel occlusions may be treatable. History of abrupt onset of unresponsiveness may be a key clue. Non-contrast CT may not detect large vessel occlusion until infarction has progressed; advanced vascular imaging is often needed. Interventional radiology techniques with or without thrombolysis may allow for a sometimes dramatic recovery.

Cerebellar hemorrhage should be detected by a non-contract CT scan. Patients may be profoundly unresponsive with absent cranial nerve reflexes yet prompt evacuation of the hemorrhage may allow in some cases meaningful recovery.
