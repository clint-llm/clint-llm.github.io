Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a narrowing or blockage of the portal vein by a blood clot. Thrombosis can develop in the main body of the portal vein or its intrahepatic branches and may even extend to the splenic or superior mesenteric veins (SMV). PVT frequently occurs with cirrhosis of the liver. It may also occur without an associated liver disease like malignancy, abdominal sepsis, pancreatitis, etc. The terminology of Extra Hepatic Portal Venous Obstruction (EHPVO) should be considered as a separate entity which refers to the development of portal cavernoma or collaterals around chronic portal vein thrombosis.
