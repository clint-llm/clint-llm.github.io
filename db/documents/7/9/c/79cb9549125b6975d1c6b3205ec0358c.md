The prognosis of vitamin A deficiency depends on the severity of the disease at treatment initiation.

The early ophthalmologic signs, such as night blindness, conjunctival xerosis, and Bitot spots, will resolve completely within about 2 months of supplementation, while corneal xerosis and ulceration results in scarring that may lead to permanent vision loss despite treatment.

Mortality in children with night blindness is triple the mortality found in children with subclinical VAD. Children with both Bitotâ€™s spots and night blindness have mortality nine times that of children with subclinical VAD. Nearly two-thirds of children with keratomalacia die within months.
