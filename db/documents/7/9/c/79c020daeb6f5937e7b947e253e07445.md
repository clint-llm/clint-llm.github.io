Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a phosphoramidite prodrug of a monophosphate nucleoside analog (GS-441524) and acts as a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RdRp) inhibitor, targeting the viral genome replication process.

Theoretically, nucleoside analogs do not permeate through the cell wall easily. Upon their subsequent entry into the host cell, they require phosphorylation to produce nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), which resembles adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and can be used by the RdRp enzymes or complexes for genome replication.

Once remdesivir is metabolized by the host cells into its pharmacologic active analog adenosine triphosphate (GS-443902), it competes with ATP for integration by the RdRp complex into the nascent RNA strand and, upon subsequent incorporation of a few more nucleotides, results in termination of RNA synthesis limiting viral replication.

Remdesivir demonstrated potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in primary human airway epithelial cultures and human lung cells. Remdesivir also had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50).****

Data regarding the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir is limited. A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, phase I study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of single-dose and multiple-dose remdesivir compared to placebo in healthy subjects reported that, following single-dose IV administration of remdesivir over 2 hours, remdesivir and its metabolites exhibited a linear profile across the study doses that ranged from 3 to 225 mg with both solution and lyophilized formulations also exhibiting similar pharmacokinetic parameters.****

Remdesivir is a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide OATP1B1, OATP1B3,****and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters and many cytochrome P450 (CYP450) that include CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 and is considered to be an inhibitor of  CYP enzymes in vitro; however, there has been no evidence of CYP induction by remdesivir and its metabolites in vivo. However, based on its route of administration, and rapid elimination, its potential to cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may be limited**.**
