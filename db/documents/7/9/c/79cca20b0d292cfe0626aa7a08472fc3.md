The GABA-positive allosteric modulators used in clinical practice fall under four categories: benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol, and induction anesthetics. There are also drugs used to treat insomnia, e.g., zolpidem. Generally, these drugs will cause sedation, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects. The specific indications of each drug appear in outline form below.Â Benzodiazepines consist of drugs such as alprazolam, lorazepam, diazepam, etc. Most of these agents are recognizable by the suffixes -zolam and -pam.

These drugs are now recommended for the short-term management of insomnia, panic disorder, and anxiety due to the risk of physical and psychological tolerance and dependence. They are also helpful as abortive medications for generalized clonic-tonic seizures and seizure prophylaxis in alcohol withdrawal. Midazolam and lorazepam are also used for light sedation in short outpatient or interventional radiology procedures. Drugs in this class exert their action by increasing the effects of an agonist when they achieve potentiation.

Most general anesthetics are positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors. Positive allosteric modulators work by increasing the frequency with which the chlorine channel opens when an agonist binds to its own site on the GABA receptor. This action results in an increase in the chloride ion concentration in the postsynaptic neuron and causes immediate hyperpolarization of this neuron, making it less excitable and thus inhibiting the possibility of an action potential. Drugs that act like GABA agonists, the benzodiazepines, are widely used to manage seizures, muscle spasms, insomnia, delirium, and anxiety.

Barbiturates were once used to induce sedation but are now used for short-term management of insomnia, seizure prophylaxis, and euthanasia. Phenobarbital specifically can be used in neonatal jaundice. It is also a recognized drug of misuse. Ethanol is a potential drug of abuse. It has a specific application in the septal ablation of patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Intravenous anesthetics such as etomidate, propofol, midazolam, and thiopental are useful for inducing sedation in surgical procedures.
