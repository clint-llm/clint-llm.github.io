The femur is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the human body. At the proximal end, the pyramid-shaped neck attaches the spherical head at the apex and the cylindrical shaft at the base. There are also 2 prominent bony protrusions, the greater trochanter and lesser trochanter, that attach to muscles that move the hip and knee. The angle between the neck and shaft, also known as the inclination angle is about 128 degrees in the average adult. However, the inclination angle decreases with age.

The hip is a ball-in-socket joint that is composed of the acetabulum of the pelvis encompassing the femoral head. The head is pointed in a medial, superior, and slightly anterior direction. Ligamentum teres femoris connects the acetabulum to the fovea capitis femoris, which is a pit on the head.

The shaft has a mild anterior arch. At the distal femur, the shaft flares out in a cone-shaped manner onto a cuboidal base made up of the medial and lateral condyle. Medial and lateral condyle join the femur to the tibia, forming the knee joint.

Both hips and knees are synovial joints that are covered by cartilage to reduce friction and optimize the range of motion. Bony features are landmarks for measuring axis along the femur.
