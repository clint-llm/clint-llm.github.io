Surgery of the superior colliculus should be approached with caution as the midbrain is an eloquent area associated with significant risks from surgical resection. Surgery is for tectal gliomas. However, complications include visual defects, Parinaud syndrome, mutism, and reduction to a vegetative state followed by death. Thus, surgical resection is often reserved based on the progression of the tumor. Treatment for tectal gliomas is still controversial and up for debate, yet with the advent of novel neurosurgical microsurgical techniques, this once inaccessible area is now approachable with increased safety.
