GABA-positive allosteric modulators are medications used in the management and treatment of seizures, sedation, anxiolytic, alcohol withdrawal, and muscle spasms. It is in the benzodiazepine/barbiturate class of medications. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for GABA-positive allosteric modulators as a valuable agent in managing seizures, anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, sedation, and muscle spasms. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional healthcare team in the care of patients with seizures, anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, sedation, and muscle spasms and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of GABA-positive allosteric modulators.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of GABA-positive allosteric modulators.
- Review appropriate monitoring for patients receiving GABA-positive allosteric modulators.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance GABA-positive allosteric modulators and improve outcomes.
