EEG has manyÂ potential uses:

- To distinguish epileptic seizures from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, syncope (fainting), sub-cortical movement disorders, and migraine variants

- To differentiate encephalopathy from psychiatric syndromes like catatonia

- To provide ancillary brain death testing

- To determine whether to wean anti-epileptic medications

- To characterize seizures to determine the most appropriate anti-epileptic medication

- To localize the region of the brain from which a seizure originates for workup of possible epilepsy surgery
