Trochlear nerve palsy is a frequently seen condition in ophthalmology clinics. In most cases, it may be congenital or post-traumatic but can occasionally manifest a more sinister underlying disease and require timely intervention. The symptoms of diplopia can be bothersome for the patients, and a correct diagnosis with appropriate management is mandated. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of trochlear nerve palsy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.
