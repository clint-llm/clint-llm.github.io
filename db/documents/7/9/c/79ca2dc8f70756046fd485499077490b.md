Retinitis is an inflammation of the retina, which can cause permanent vision loss. Numerous microbes can cause retinitis. These pathogens can affect patients differently depending on characteristics like age, location, and immune status. Important noninfectious causes like Behcet disease also can cause retinitis as its primary manifestation in the eye. Retinitis may present alone or with varying choroidal involvement as retinochoroiditis or chorioretinitis, depending upon the site of primary involvement. This activity will discuss the more common causes of retinitis and the role of an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of retinitis.
- Describe the clinical findings of various etiologies of retinitis.
- Outline treatment options available for retinitis.
- Summarize the complications and prognosis of retinitis and the role of the unprofessional team in identifying the etiology and guiding appropriate management at the earliest in order to save vision and improve outcomes.
