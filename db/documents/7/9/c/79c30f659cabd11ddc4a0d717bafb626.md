Our understanding of blood transfusion has improved dramatically over the past three decades. Unlike before, empirical blood transfusions are no longer the norm. While blood products do have a benefit, they can also cause harm. Healthcare workers who look after patients needing a blood transfusion should consult with a hematologist if they remain unsure about the indications. Interprofessional team collaboration is crucial in managing patients undergoing blood transfusions and those having adverse reactions to transfusions. The key is to reduce the harm from unnecessary blood transfusions.
