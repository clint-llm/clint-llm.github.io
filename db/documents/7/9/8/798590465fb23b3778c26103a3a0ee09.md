Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) constitutes a group of autosomal dominant disorders characterized by a wide spectrum of endocrine and non-endocrine diseases. MEN is divided into different types depending on the clinical presentations and genetic mutation. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is the most common syndrome. MEN1 is characterized by primary hyperparathyroidism secondary to parathyroid gland hyperplasia, pituitary adenoma, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

In comparison, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is less common. Depending on clinical phenotype, MEN2 is divided into MEN2A and MEN2B. MEN2A is characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, MEN2B is characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, marfanoid features, and neuromas of lips, tongue, and colon.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4) is the latest member of MEN syndromes. MEN4 is rare and shares a similar phenotype spectrum to MEN1.
