The morphological changes seen in dens evaginatus are thought to occur early in odontogenesis, during the morphodifferentiation stage of tooth development.

Dens invaginatus results from an alteration of the developing tooth structure during the proliferation and morphodifferentiation stage of tooth development.

Amelogenesis imperfecta is a genetic alteration in the formation of enamel. This condition results from mutations of multiple genes, many of which code for enamel proteins, either structural or enzymatic, various transcription factors, cellular proteins, and calcium carriers.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a genetic alteration in the formation of dentin. The formation of dentin (dentinogenesis) arises from an organic pre-dentin matrix calcified by the signal from the odontoblasts. As dentinogenesis progresses, these odontoblasts are responsible for multipleÂ intricate processes that lead to the proper formation of dentin, which affects other dental structures. Mutation in the genes that encode protein constituents of dentin results in hereditary dentin defects.
