The QLB produces a broad distribution of local anesthetic resulting in a large area of sensory inhibition of (T7 through L1 in most cases). Therefore, QLBs may be used to provide postoperative analgesia for abdominal and pelvic regions. For this reason, the QLB is often used in the treatment of pain after abdominal, obstetric, gynecologic, and urologic surgeries. There are also case reports of QLBs being used successfully in the hip, femur, and lumbar vertebrae surgeries.
