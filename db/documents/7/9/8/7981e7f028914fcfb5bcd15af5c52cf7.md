**Screening Tests**

**Tuberculin skin testing: Mantoux test (skin testing with PPD)**

The Mantoux reaction following the injection of a dose of PPD (purified protein derivative) is the traditional screening test for exposure to Tuberculosis. The result is interpreted taking into consideration the patient's overall risk of exposure. Patients are classified into 3 groups based on the risk of exposure with three corresponding cut-off points. The 3 major groups used are discussed below.

Low Risk

- Individuals with minimal probability of exposure are considered to have a positive Mantoux test only if there is very significant induration following intradermal injection of PPD. The cut-off point for this group of people (with minimal risk of exposure) is taken to be 15 mm.

Intermediate Risk

- Individuals with intermediate probability are considered positive if the induration is greater than 10 mm.

High Risk

- Individuals with a high risk of a probability of exposure are considered positive if the induration is greater than 5 mm.

Examples of Patients in the Different Risk Categories

- Low Risk/Low Probability: Patients with no known risk of exposure to TB. Example: No history of travel, military service, HIV-negative, no contact with a chronic cough patient, no occupational exposure, no history of steroids. Not a resident of a TB-endemic region.

- Intermediate Risk/Probability: Residents of TB-endemic countries (Latin America, Sub -Sahara Africa, Asia), workers or residents of shelters, Medical or microbiology department personnel.

- High Risk/Probability: HIV-positive patient, a patient with evidence of the previous TB such as the healed scar on an x-ray), contact with chronic cough patients.

Note that a Mantoux test indicates exposure or latent tuberculosis. However, this test lacks specificity, and patients would require subsequent visits for interpreting the results as well as chest x-ray for confirmation. Although relatively sensitive, the Mantoux reaction is not very specific and may give false-positive reactions in individuals who have been exposed to the BCG-vaccine.

**Interferon release assays (IGRA, Quantiferon Assays)**

This is a tuberculosis screening test that is more specific and equally as sensitive as the Mantoux test. This test assays for the level of the inflammatory cytokine, especially interferon gamma.

The advantages of Quantiferon, especially in those with prior vaccination with BCG vaccine, include, the test requires a single blood draw, obviating the need for repeat visits to interpret results. Furthermore, additional investigations such as HIV screening could be performed (after patient consent) on the same blood draw.

Quantiferon's disadvantages include cost and the technical expertise required to perform the test.

**Screening in Immunocompromised Patients**

Immunocompromised patients may show lower levels of reaction to PPD or false-negative Mantoux because of cutaneous anergy.

A high level of suspicion should be entertained when reviewing negative screening tests for tuberculosis in HIV-positive individuals.

**The Significance of Screening**

A positive screening test indicates exposure to tuberculosis and a high chance of developing active tuberculosis in the future. Tuberculosis incidence in patients with positive Mantoux test averages between 2% to 10% without treatment.

Patients with a positive test should have a chest x-ray as a minimum diagnostic test. In some cases, these patients should have additional tests. Patients meeting the criteria for latent tuberculosis should receive prophylaxis with isoniazid.

**Screening Questionnaires****for Resource-Poo**r**Settings**

Several screening questionnaires have been validated to enable healthcare workers working in remote and resource-poor environments screen for tuberculosis.

These questionnaires make use of an algorithm that combines several clinical signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. Some of the commonly used symptoms are:

- Chronic cough

- Weight loss

- Fever and night sweats

- History of contact

- HIV status

- Blood in sputum

Several studies have confirmed the utility of using several criteria rather than a focus on only chronic cough or weight loss.

**Confirmatory and Diagnostic Tests**

- A chest x-ray is indicated to rule out or rule in the presence of active disease in all screening test positive cases.

- Acid Fast Staining-Ziehl-Neelsen

- Culture

- Nuclear Amplification and Gene-Based Tests: These represent a new generation of diagnostic tools for tuberculosis. These tests enable identification of the bacteria or bacteria particles making use of DNA-based molecular techniques. Examples are Genexpert and DR-MTB.

The new molecular-based techniques are faster and enable rapid diagnosis with high precision. Confirmation of TB could be made in hours rather than the days or weeks it takes to wait for a standard culture. This is very important, especially among immunocompromised hosts where there is a high rate of false-negative results. Some molecular-based tests such as GeneXpert and DR-MTB also allow for the identification of multidrug resistant tuberculosis.
