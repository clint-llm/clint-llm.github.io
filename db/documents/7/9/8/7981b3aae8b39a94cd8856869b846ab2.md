Contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen are relatively few but may include: confinement anxiety, severe congestive heart failure, severe reactive airways disease, untreated pneumothorax, and concomitant doxorubicin or bleomycin therapy. Systemic corticosteroids may be contraindicated in patients with psychiatric illness, diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, breastfeeding, and liver disease. For these patients, intra-tympanic steroids may be a better option.
