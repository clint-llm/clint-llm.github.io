Typically, the onset of monilethrix is during early childhood.

The clinical expression may vary from an almost normal scalp with few affected follicles to total alopecia. It is usually very characteristic, with diffuse hypotrichosis of the scalp and with extremely short dull and fragile hair that breaks easily, especially in the sites of friction such as the top of the head, the nape, and occipital areas.

In severe forms, other hairy areas such as the eyelashes, the eyebrows, or the secondary sexual hairs may be involved.

Perifollicular abnormalities are usually associated with the hair shaft fragility, ranging from perifollicular erythema to large hyperkeratotic follicular papules, most commonly found on the occiput. The hair fragility may as well be associated with trichorrhexis nodosa or other rare ectodermal symptoms such as syndactyly, cataracts, dental abnormalities, and nail abnormalities (koilonychia, brittle nails).
