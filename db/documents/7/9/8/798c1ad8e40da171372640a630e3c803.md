**Creatinine
**

Serum creatinine is elevated when there is a significant reduction in the glomerular filtration rate or when urine elimination is obstructed.  About 50%  of kidney function must be lost before a rise in serum creatinine can be detected. Thus serum creatinine is a late marker of acute kidney injury.

**BUN
**

Serum urea/BUN level increases in acute and chronic renal disease.

eGFR equations are used to determine the presence of renal disease, stage of CKD, and to monitor response to treatment.
