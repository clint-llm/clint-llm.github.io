Endothelial cell loss: It is more common with ACIOLs. This may lead to corneal decompensation, and in extreme cases, explantation of the IOL may be required when the endothelial count drops below 2000 cells per millimeter square. A 1% mean annual reduction in endothelial cell count has been seen in angle fixed IOLs when the distance between the corneal endothelium and the edge of the IOL is 1.43 mm.

In a study on the implantation of anterior chamber phakic IOLs, the NuVita IOL reported 2.35% endothelial cell loss at one year and was thus withdrawn.

In a 12 year retrospective study on 144 eyes implanted with ICL, Moya et al. reported 6.46% surgically induced endothelial cell loss during the first year, beyond which an average yearly decrease rate of 1.20% was noted.

IOL rotation happens due to inappropriate sizing. May lead to induced astigmatism in cases of toric IOLs.

Pigment dispersion may lead to lens deposits. Usually, no intervention is required.

Chronic inflammation and uveitis are more common with ACIOLs.

Pupil distortion is seen in ACIOLs. This may lead to intractable glare and maybe cosmetically unacceptable.

Pupillary block and glaucoma: Pupillary block may occur due to inappropriate vaulting in the case of PCIOLs. It may resolve after pupil dilation and use of pressure-lowering agents, but the definitive treatment is the creation or enhancement of a previously created peripheral iridotomy. Retained viscoelastic material may also cause raised intraocular pressure (IOP). Angle fixed IOLs may block the angles and lead to a rise in IOP.

Glare and halos are seen when the scotopic pupil size is greater than the optic of the IOL. Miotic agents may be given for resolution.

Cataract formation occurs in low PIOL vault or undersized PCIOL. This is mostly in the form of anterior subcapsular opacities that develop due to the pressure of the IOL on the crystalline lens. Lens material also plays a role. Silicone in PRL may predispose more to cataract formation than Collamer of ICL.

In a 5-year retrospective study, Brar et al. reported that, in a total of 957 eyes, significant anterior subcapsular cataract (ASC) requiring explantation developed in four eyes (0.4%).

As most cases are high myopes, there are chances of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD) more than emmetropic eyes, in the range of 0.7% to 3.2%.
