Historically, clinicians used the acronyms TUBS and AMBRI to classify shoulder instability into two broad etiologic categories:

- Traumatic, Unilateral, Bankart lesion, Surgery (TUBS)

- Atraumatic, Multidirectional, Bilateral, Rehabilitation, Inferior capsular shift (AMBRI)

However, while these acronyms were traditionally helpful to aid providers in identifying and treating patients with acute or recurrent instability, these categories do not help the clinician differentiate instability from soft tissue hyperlaxity. As our knowledge regarding the etiology and underlying pathophysiology at clinical presentation evolved over the last few decades, clinicians began to recognize the need to differentiate possible complex shoulder instability patterns that can present in the setting of recurrent and repetitive microtrauma (often low-energy) from acute macrotrauma (often high-energy). Thus, it is more helpful to classify based on different criteria.

- Uni- or multidirectional instability

- Traumatic or atraumatic

- Traumatic cases are often unidirectional with an associated capsulolabral injury.
- Atraumatic cases are often multidirectional with associated hyperlaxity.

- Presence or absence of accompanying soft-tissue hyperlaxity

- Causes of soft tissue hyperlaxity, including patulous capsular laxity, can be congenital or secondary to repeated microtrauma, major trauma, multiple instability events, recurrences, or a combination of these factors.
