Adrenal masses are a frequent observation in the adrenal gland. While most lesions are benign, adrenocortical carcinoma should be a consideration when a patient presents with hypercortisolism. This activity describes the evaluation and management of adrenocortical carcinoma and reviews the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the importance of understanding the pathophysiology of adrenocortical carcinoma relative to new treatments. 
- Review the presentation and the evaluation of a patient with adrenal incidentaloma.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for adrenocortical carcinoma. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with adrenocortical carcinoma.
