Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral x-rays are useful in most cases. When the decrease range of motion is 45 degrees or greater, the AP incidence is difficult to obtain. CT scan is useful in sequelae of complex fractures and when there are doubts about treatment planning.

Classification

For an optimal evaluation and understanding of the eventual treatment, stiffness can be classified as:

- **Extrinsic**, without joint affection (ligaments, muscular and capsule)

- **Intrinsic**, with compromise of the articular surface, possibly due to adhesions, osteophytes, chondrolysis, or trauma

- M**ixed**: combined intrinsic with extrinsic injuries. These are more frequent. Most of the times, intrinsic causes envolve to an extrinsic stiffness.

According to the arc of movement (flexion, extension), stiffness can be classified in mild, less than 90 degrees of range, moderate between 60 to 90 degrees,  serious between 30 to 60 degrees and severe less than 30 degrees.

The following guide has been proposed to differentiate simple from complex contractures. Simple compromise should meet the following features:

- Mid or moderate contracture: the movement range of 80 degrees or greater

- Non-existent or minor previous surgery

- Without prior transposition of the ulnar nerve

- Without osteosynthesis or minimum material

- Without heterotopic or minimal ossifications

- Normal bone anatomy.

If at least one of these criteria is absent, the contracture is considered complex.
