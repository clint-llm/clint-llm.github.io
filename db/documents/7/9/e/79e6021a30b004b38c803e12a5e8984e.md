Painful conditions related to facet arthritis usually occur after sudden twisting or flexion/extension of the spine while lifting or after acceleration-deceleration injuries. Depending on the level of injury, the pain is usually localized over the neck or back with some degree of radiation into the upper or lower limbs in a non-dermatomal distribution.

In the upper cervical spine, the referred pain tends to transfer up to the occipital region and may be combined with a headache. In the lower cervical spine, the referred pain tends to be down to the shoulder girdle and inter-scapular region. In the lumbar spine, the referred pain is around the buttock and thigh and rarely passes beyond the knee.

Pain associated with facet arthritis, as compared to radicular pain, is not likely to accompany neurologic findings such as motor or sensory loss or diminished reflexes.

Physical examination, including tenderness over the facet joint and pain aggravated by extension/rotation and relieved by flexion, are indicative of possible facet arthritis.

One clinical test that has been described to diagnose facet arthritis is the Kemp test. A patient will be asked to perform extension combined with the rotation of the spinal region of interest, with a positive test defined as a reproduction of the patient’s pain. However, the diagnostic accuracy is not high according to the systemic review performed by Kent et al.
