This procedure does not require many instruments and can be performed at the bedside. A general anesthetic is not usually required, although sedation can be used. A local anesthetic is required to infiltrate unburnt skin, into which the escharotomy will extend. A scalpel or cutting diathermy can be used to make the incision, and a diathermy cauterization device should be used to control bleeding.
