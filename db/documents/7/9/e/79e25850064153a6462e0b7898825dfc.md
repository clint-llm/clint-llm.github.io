A patient presenting with a carbuncle typically provides a history of a slowly enlarging tender nodule. The patient may state that it started as a "pimple" or pustule that they tried to pop, however over several days to weeks, the lesion grew progressively larger and became tender and fluctuant. Carbuncles are known to cause systemic symptoms; however, this is not mandatory for the diagnosis. Systemic symptoms may include regional lymphadenopathy, fever, fatigue, and malaise.

A carbuncle classically presents as a red, erythematous, painful nodule, with multiple overlying pustules.
