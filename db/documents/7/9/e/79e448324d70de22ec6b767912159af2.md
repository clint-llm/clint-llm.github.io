E. coli O157: H7 attaches to the microvilli of the intestinal epithelial cells utilizing the fimbriae of the intestinal cellular walls. Bacterial attachment results in characteristic effacing lesions that flatten the microvilli as bacteria rearrange the cytoskeletal actin underneath the epithelial layer and disrupt normal intestinal cell function.Â Large intestinal biopsy of hemorrhagic colitis specimens demonstrates cellular hemorrhage and edema characteristic of intestinal inflammation. The histologic features resemble a pattern similar to ischemic colitis and other toxin-mediated infectious colitis like C. difficile, making E. coli O157: H7 challenging to differentiate on histology alone.
