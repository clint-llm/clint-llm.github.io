An interprofessional team that includes primary care physicians, podiatric surgeons, nurses, and physical therapists is the best approach for the management of hammertoe deformity. It may start as an initial visit to the primary care physician due to pain, swelling, or aesthetic concern. The diagnosis is made through a clinical examination, and radiographic imaging is helpful in evaluating the underlying structures and necessity for potential future surgical planning. However, conservative management should be considered as the primary approach. If proven ineffective, then the patient should get a referral to a surgeon and undergo a thorough surgical evaluation. If the patient undergoes surgery, post-operative protocol, including rehabilitation, should follow to maximize functionality; post-operative pain management with a focus on minimizing the opioid use should also be initiated. It is important for the patient to continue long term follow up to ensure the proper recovery timeline and milestones are being met.
