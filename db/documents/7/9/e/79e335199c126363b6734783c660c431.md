Diagnosis and treatment of AI in a timely fashion is important in all, but given that it is associated with grave complications, it has extra significance in critically ill patients. It is of utmost importance that in a critically ill patient suspected of corticosteroid deficiency, the administration of steroids should not be delayed for testing of AI or CST. If clinically feasible, random serum cortisol and ACTH should be drawn before the administration of stress dose steroids.

High-dose CST is also used as a confirmatory test to diagnose non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH). NCCAH is characterized by the partial activity of enzyme 21 hydroxylase 21 OH). This leads to the accumulation of 17 hydroxy-progesterone (17OHP) and androgens. The symptoms are much milder than classic congenital hyperplasia (CAH) and are usually limited to menstrual irregularity and symptoms of hyperandrogenism like hirsutism and acne. Cortisol levels are usually normal. This can be diagnosed if baseline 17 OHP is greater than 200 ng/dl. High-dose CST can be used for confirmation if levels are lower than 240nmol/L. During the test,  17 OHP levels are measured at baseline and 60 min after IV/IM administration of 250 mcg cosyntropin. The stimulation of 17OHP to more than 1500 ng/dl confirms the diagnosis of NCCAH.
