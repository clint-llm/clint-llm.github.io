Foot drop is not a  commonly seen condition. Patients may present to ERs, primary care settings, and other medical clinics. The primary provider may or may not be comfortable handling such a case but can recognize the clinical syndrome and direct care in the proper direction. Prompt diagnosis and identification are necessary since time is essential, especially if a patient requires surgery.

A thorough anatomical and neurologic background is the mainstay in management and evaluation. Prompt diagnosis, by utilization of appropriate imaging modalities, to rule out bone lesions and other more serious space-occupying entities is crucial. A neurologist and a PM&R specialist play a major role in providing diagnosis and prognosis. PM&R physicians also coordinate a prosthetic/orthotic team to provide the initial brace and take charge of the aftercare. They also supervise Physical and occupational therapy to ensure the patient is making progress, lack of which should prompt consideration for other options. PT and OTs provide muscle reeducation, balance, coordination, and fall prevention strategies. A nurse can be essential in providing education for skincare. For pain management, a consultation with a pharmacist may be necessary. Regular follow-up services should include skincare, maintenance of the brace and other ambulation devices, and review of exercise protocols. Initial  EMG studies and follow-up (in 3-4 months following the initial presentation) will further strengthen the outcomes.

The following is an example of the care coordination plan.

- A thorough history and physical examination

- Assessment of risk factors

- Consultation with neurology and PMR

- Order diagnostic imaging, EMG

- Provision of pain management

- Provision of the brace as needed with orthotist

- Referrals to PT and OT

- potential surgical consultation and or intervention

- Review of skincare, fall prevention

- Follow up appointments as needed
