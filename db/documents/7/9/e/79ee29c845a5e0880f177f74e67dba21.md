The differential diagnosis for posterior interosseous nerve syndrome includes radial tunnel syndrome and Wartenberg syndrome.

Radial tunnel syndrome may involve the same sites of compression as posterior interosseous nerve syndrome. However, it presents with forearm pain without motor weakness. The pain usually starts in the dorsoradial forearm and may radiate down the lateral forearm to the dorsal radial hand. There may be tenderness over the mobile wad, which is often confused with lateral epicondylitis. The tenderness in radial tunnel syndrome is usually more distal than lateral epicondylitis; the maximal tenderness is approximately 3 to 5 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle.

Wartenberg syndrome, also known as "cheiralgia paresthetica," is a compression of the superficial sensory radial nerve. This nerve is usually compressed between the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus tendons. Because the superficial sensory radial nerve has no motor innervation, the symptoms are purely sensory. There will be no motor weakness. Patients may present with paresthesias, numbness, or ill-defined pain over the dorsal radial aspect of the hand.
