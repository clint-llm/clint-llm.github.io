Each islet comprises a central core of beta cells, surrounded by a mantle of alpha, delta, epsilon, and pancreatic polypeptide cells. Although most islets follow this "mantle-core" pattern, there are variations amongst islets of different sizes. In general, beta cells comprise up to 60% of islet mass. Alpha cells comprise up to 30% of islet mass; delta, epsilon, and pancreatic polypeptide cells make up the remaining 10% of islet mass. The blood supply and innervation for each islet are provided by a neurovascular bundleÂ that penetrates the islet through the central core of beta cells.
