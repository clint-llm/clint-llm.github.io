Most severe complications occur in cases of delayed diagnosis and treatment. Complications can include:

- Secondary infection - resulting from disruption of the normal skin barrier.

- Scarring - these can result from the lesion itself or treatments.

- Lymphedema - most commonly occurs secondary to the removal of lymph nodes but can result from cancer alone.

- Local recurrence - especially in cases that were more advanced before diagnosis.

- Metastases - more common with advanced cases, and melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas

- Depression and anxiety - because of cosmesis issues.
