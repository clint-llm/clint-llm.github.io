Insulin lispro is frequently prescribed by nurse practitioners, primary caregivers, internists, endocrinologists, and many other healthcare workers to manage hyperglycemia. It is vital that anyone who prescribes this insulin, understand that it can rapidly cause hypoglycemia. Thus, monitoring of blood glucose levels is critical.Â The most common adverse effect found in patients using insulin lispro is hypoglycemia. For this reason, close glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes, and any changes made to the dosing should be done so under medical supervision. Hypokalemia is another adverse effect to pay close attention to, especially with patients who are using potassium-lowering drugs or taking drugs sensitive to serum potassium level. Other adverse effects include hypertrophy at the injection site, injection site reaction, and lipodystrophy at the injection site.
