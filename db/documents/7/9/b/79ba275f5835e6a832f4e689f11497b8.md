The overall prognosis of patients depends on the size and number of fibroids and the treatment modality they choose. Comparing Options For Management: Patient-centered results for Uterine Fibroids (COMPARE-UF), a prospective nationwide registry that looked at the short-term interval follow-up after different routes of myomectomy in 1206 women, showed that regardless of the type of myomectomy, all had improvement in short-term health-related quality of life and symptom severity score improvement. Return to usual activity averaged at 0 days in HSC-M patients compared to 21 and 28 days for laparoscopic and abdominal myomectomy, respectively.

Some notable risk factors for fibroid recurrence include age less than 35.5 years, two or fewer fibroids at time of surgery, size of the uterus less than 13 weeks of gestation, and no childbearing after surgery.

For those patients who become pregnant following myomectomy, delivery modality and timing of delivery recommendations are dependent on factors as the type of fibroid removed, number and location of incisions on the uterus, and if hysterotomy was made. The main concern in pregnancy in patients with a non-low transverse scar on the uterus, especially those with a mid-vertical or trans-fundal uterine scar, is the risk of uterine rupture, which is as high as 10%. Although published data is limited, the risk of uterine rupture after myomectomy is reportedly closer to 1%, similar to the risk of a trial of labor after cesarean section with successful vaginal delivery being achieved in about 90% of patients.

According to the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), patients with a prior myomectomy with entry into the uterine cavity should undergo a scheduled cesarean delivery between 37-38 weeks gestation. If extensive trans-fundal scarring is suggested from the myomectomy operative report, delivery should be considered between 36 and 37 weeks gestation.
