Cutaneous pathologic findings: Sub-epidermal bullae and thick hyalinized blood vessels in the upper dermis are seen. Caterpillar bodies, which are linear globules that stain PAS-positive, are present at the roof of the blisters and represent disintegrating keratinocytes and basement membrane material. Dermal sclerosis may also be present, which can be histologically identical to scleroderma.

Hepatic pathologic findings: Focal steatosis and lobular necrosis with pigment laden macrophages can be seen along with portal inflammation and periportal siderosis. The accumulation of porphyrins can be demonstrated by red autofluorescence upon exposure to UV light. Acicular inclusions, which are birefringent needle-like cytoplasmic inclusions, are specific to PCT and represent uroporphyrin accumulation.
