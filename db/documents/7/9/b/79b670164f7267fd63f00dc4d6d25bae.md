UBC is often asymptomatic. Incidentally detected UBC in the femur or humerus is common. On occasions, pain can arise due to spontaneous fracture through the cyst.

ABC: Long bones and spine are mostly involved. Mild to moderate pain, present for weeks to months is the most common symptom which brings patients to the clinic.

Physical examination shows tenderness, local swelling, and torticollis/scoliosis or neurological deficits in case of a spine cyst.
