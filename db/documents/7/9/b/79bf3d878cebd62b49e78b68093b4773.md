Hearing loss is a widespread chronic condition that affects over 25 million people in the United States aged 12 years old or older and may affect 1 in 5 children, temporarily or permanently, by the age of 18.

While Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests are useful for clinical screening and identifying the type of hearing loss, they may miss nuances such as mild hearing loss, bilateral hearing loss, or mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.
