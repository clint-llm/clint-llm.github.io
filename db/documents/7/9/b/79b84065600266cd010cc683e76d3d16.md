There are multiple reasons why an hCG test (serum or urine) may have a false report. While uncommon, false positive hCG tests can result in unnecessary medical care and/or irreversible surgical procedures. False negatives may be equally concerning and result in a delay in care or diagnostic evaluation. Potential causes of false results are listed and briefly discussed.

**Serum False Positives (1/1000 to 1/10,000)**

- Ectopic production of hCG (hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and germ cell tumors,

- Heterophile antibodies (autoantibodies and antibodies formed after exposure to animal products that interact with the assay antibodies)

- Rheumatoid factors (can bind the antibodies in the assay as well)

- IgA deficiency

- Chronic renal failure or ESRD on hemodialysis (rare)

- Red blood cell or plasma transfusion of blood with hCG in it have been reported

- Exogenous hCG preparations for weight loss, assisted reproduction, doping

**Serum False Negatives**

- Early measurement after conception

- "Hook effect" can occur when hCG levels are about 500,000 mIU/mL.

**Urine False Positives**

- Blood or protein in the urine

- Human error in result interpretation

- Ectopic production of hCG

- Exogenous hCG

- Drugs (aspirin, carbamazepine, methadone, high urinary pH and seminal fluid)

**Urine False Negatives**

- Early measurement after conception

- Dilute urine specimen

- "Hook effect" as discussed above
