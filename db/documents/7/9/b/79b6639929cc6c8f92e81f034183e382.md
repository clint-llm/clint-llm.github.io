Patients should be educated about asthma concerning the use of medications. They should understand how to take medications and also the differences between quick-acting medications and maintenance medications such as inhaled corticosteroids.

Patients should also be encouraged to use an asthma action plan, so they understand when their symptoms are severe, and they need to contact a physician or go to the emergency room.

The asthma APGAR (activities, persistent, triggers, asthma medications, response to therapy) tools in primary care practices have been shown to improve rates of asthma control and reduce emergency room and urgent care visits.
