Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are the nuclear imaging techniques used more frequently to diagnose liver malignancy and evaluate response to treatment metastasis, recurrence, and prognosis. F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and C-acetate PET are more common nuclear imaging modalities in diagnosing liver malignancy.

Transarterial radioembolization and selective internal radiotherapy are theragnosis methods in the nuclear medicine field with the direct usage of PET or SPECT for diagnosis and treatment simultaneously.
