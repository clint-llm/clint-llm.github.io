The cause of mononucleosis is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a type of herpesvirus spread by contact, typically with salivary secretions. The duration of oral shedding is not entirely clear, but high levels of shedding can continue for a median of 6 months after illness onset. Transmission is generally person-to-person, but EBV is not considered a highly contagious disease.

Besides EBV other causes include:

- CMV

- Adenovirus

- Hepatitis A

- HIV

- Toxoplasma

- Rubella
