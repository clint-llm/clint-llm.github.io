Urination or micturition removes metabolic products and toxic wastes filtered from the kidneys and is a vital function of the human body. The micturition reflex requires a complex network of signals between the nervous system and the urinary tract system. Urine storage and emptying are highly dependent on these pathways. For these reasons, neurological function and anatomic abnormalities can involve many disease states such as incontinence, obstruction, or infections.
