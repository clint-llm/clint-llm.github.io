The external jugular vein courses superficial to and obliquely across the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the superficial fascia.  Part of its descent in the neck is also along the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in its lower third.  It then descends superficial and anterior to the anterior scalene muscle before penetrating the investing deep cervical fascia and entering the subclavian vein.  The platysma muscle lies superficial to it along its entire course.
