Viscoelastics are also known as ophthalmic viscosurgical devices.

Viscoelastics were first introduced in 1972 to aid in ophthalmic surgery as a replacement for aqueous and vitreous.Â Sodium hyaluronate was the first viscoelastic introduced in 1972 and was patented by Swedish Pharmacia as Healon in 1980. The term viscosurgery was introduced by Dr. Endre A Balazs 30 years back, which denotes the procedures and manipulations performed using OVDs.

Viscoelastics are commonly used in cataract surgery to assist in capsulotomy and nucleus manipulation, corneal surgeries, glaucoma surgeries, open globe repairs, retinal surgery, pediatric and strabismus surgeries. Viscoelastics can be classified based on the source and rheological properties. The various complications associated with viscoelastics are secondary glaucoma, capsular block syndrome, capsular bag distension syndrome, pseudo anterior uveitis, IOL crystallization, and calcific band keratopathy.
