# Continuing Education Activity

Physicians, advanced practice nurses, nursing personnel, and midwives must be aware of what constitutes normal versus abnormal labor. Without proper education, skills, and strategies, appropriate management cannot occur, and poor outcomes become likely for birthing mothers and their neonates. Discerning patterns of abnormal labor will allow for proper intervention and management. This will decrease morbidity and mortality and improve patient outcomes. This activity characterizes normal versus abnormal labor and highlights the critical role of the interprofessional birth team in providing optimal care and counseling to the birthing mother and the infant.

**Objectives:**
- Describe when the 3 stages of normal labor begin and end.
- Identify potential reasons for abnormal labor and potential interventions that can be done.
- Explain how the uterine activity is assessed and identify the adequacy of contractions as well as tachysystole during labor.
- Define labor arrest in both latent and active stages of the first phase of labor.

# Introduction

Normal labor is defined as regular uterine contractions that cause cervical change. Abnormal labor patterns are characterized as abnormalities of the first, second, or third stage of labor. In order to understand abnormal labor, a good understanding of normal labor is needed. The first stage of labor begins with the start of labor and ends with complete cervical dilation. The second stage of labor starts with complete cervical dilation and ends with the delivery of the fetus. The third stage of labor involves the delivery of the placenta.

Labor is divided into three stages and subsequent phases within the first stage:

- First Stage: 0-10 cm dilation

- Latent phase (0-5 cm dilation)
- Active phase (6 cm dilation to complete cervical dilation)

- Second Stage: uterine contractions along with maternal expulsive efforts leading to the descent of the presenting part and to the delivery of the fetus

- Third Stage: begins with the delivery of the fetus and ends with the delivery of the placenta

The following criteria should be kept in mind when labeling the labor as abnormal:

**First Stage Protraction and Arrest**

- **Latent Phase Protraction:**
- **In nulliparas women:**greater than at least 20 hours
- **In multiparas women:**greater than at least 14 hours
- ****Due to its variable and slow progression, latent phase protraction alone should not be an indication for cesarean delivery.

- **Active Phase (once 6 cm cervical dilation is achieved)**
- **No cervical dilation after 4 hours of adequate contractions with ruptured membranes**
- **No cervical dilation after 6 hours of inadequate contractions, with ruptured membranes, despite oxytocin administration**

**Second Stage Protraction and Arrest**

- **For nulliparous women:**more than 3 hours without epidural or 4 hours with an epidural

- **For multiparous women:**more than 2 hours without epidural or 3 hours with an epidural

- Longer durations may be appropriate with reassuring maternal and fetal status and continued descent of the fetal presenting part

# Etiology

The normal progression of labor requires the inspection of **three**"Ps," representing power, passage, and passenger. The power comes from uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts. The passage is the maternal pelvis, and finally, the fetus is the passenger, who may or may not present itself in a favorable position and presentation. Abnormal progress of labor may be related to fetal factors, uterine factors, bony pelvis factors, or a combination of these. The size of the fetus and the capacity of the maternal pelvis are tested as uterine contractions provide propulsion. Asynclitism or extension of the fetal head as well as occiput posterior or transverse position or mentum or brow presentation may also be etiologies of abnormal progress of labor or labor dystocia.

A Bandl's ring may uncommonly be associated with protracted labor or labor arrest. This involves the formation of a constricting ring of the uterus which forms between the contractile portion and the lower uterus. It is not clear what causes this contraction ring. Prolonged labor may be a cause of the formation of a Bandl's ring, but the ring may also be an effect of labor dystocia.

**Risk Factors Associated with Abnormal Labor**

- Fetal macrosomia

- Maternal obesity

- Nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns

- Non-gynecoid maternal pelvimetry

- Non-occiput anterior position

- Nulliparity

- Short stature

- High fetal station at full cervical dilation

- chorioamnionitis

- Post-term pregnancy

- Bandl's ring

- Gestational diabetes

- Hypertensive disorders

- Epidural analgesia

# Epidemiology

Approximately 20% of all labors involve protraction and/or arrest disorders.  Disorders of labor are the most common reason for primary intrapartum cesarean sections.

Abnormal labor involving true labor dystocia can result in fetal and/or maternal injury and even death. The trend toward more cesarean sections in developed countries has drawn attention to initiatives to minimize primary cesarean sections. In this regard, guidelines have been developed to implement more conservative management of the first and second stages of labor abnormalities (Obstetric care consensus: safe prevention of the primary cesarean delivery-ACOG and SMFM, March 2014).

After the delivery of the baby, the third stage of labor involves the delivery of the placenta. This opens the risk for postpartum hemorrhage leading to blood transfusions and resulting in maternal morbidity and mortality. Postpartum hemorrhage affects approximately 5% of all deliveries. The mean duration of the third stage of labor is 5-6 minutes when utilizing active management of the third stage of labor. Ninety percent of labor's third stages take less than 10 minutes. Postpartum hemorrhage is more likely when the third stage lasts more than 18 minutes and significantly more likely when the third stage lasts over thirty minutes.

# Pathophysiology

Friedman originally established the labor curve for the first stage of labor; however, it has since been contemporized by Zhang et al.

The pathophysiologic etiology of abnormal labor is otherwise poorly understood. There is likely a multitude of pathophysiologic etiologies, which is why current management and intervention are limited and at times unsuccessful. It is possible that treatment options that target the specific underlying pathophysiologic etiologies may be more successful in treating labor abnormalities. Additional knowledge of diagnostic tools and individualized therapies may lead to new clinical opportunities in the future.

# Toxicokinetics

Oxytocin is a key pharmacologic agent in the correction of inadequate uterine contractions and thus in the treatment of abnormal labor. Exogenous oxytocin responsiveness typically commences at 20 weeks and improves with advancing gestational age until 34 weeks, when it appears to stabilize.

# History and Physical

Labor begins with regular uterine contractions in addition to cervical dilation and/or effacement. An important aspect of the history to obtain from the patient is at what time the contractions began and how far apart they have been.  An abdominal examination is a key component of an obstetric exam as it provides an estimated fetal weight of the fetus and informs the provider of the fetal presentation. The continuous monitoring of uterine activity discerns how frequent contractions are occurring. Only with internal pressure catheter monitoring can the actual strength of contractions be measured. Digital vaginal exams to evaluate the maternal pelvimetry, bony pelvis shape and capacity, and cervical dilation and effacement occur at various intervals throughout labor. The fetal station is also assessed with these digital exams, and this provides information regarding the descent of the fetal presenting part, an integral piece of information when determining if labor is progressing normally or abnormally.

# Evaluation

Determining the progress of labor is a key component of intrapartum care. Maternal uterine activity is assessed by either manual palpation, external tocodynamometry, or internal monitoring with a pressure catheter. With external tocodynamometry, target uterine activity is 3 to 5 contractions in a 10-minute window. The contractions should last 30 to 40 seconds to be effective. Internal intrauterine pressure assessment using a catheter may also be utilized when the amniotic sac is not intact, in which case the actual strength of contractions can be measured. The most common approach to quantitating uterine contractions is by measuring Montevideo units. Montevideo units are calculated by adding the sum of the net contraction pressures in 10 minutes.  Adequate uterine activity is targeted at 200 - 250 Montevideo units.

# Treatment / Management

Abnormal labor progression is associated with multiple poor maternal and fetal outcomes, thus active management is imperative to avoid adverse outcomes for mom and baby. Most labor and delivery units will have an established protocol for the administration of oxytocin for augmentation of inadequate labor, which entails the administration of the proper medication and dosage, as well as criteria for an incremental increase as clinically warranted. These protocols also include monitoring maternal and fetal status for adverse events. With a second stage of labor prolongation or arrest, operative vaginal delivery with either forceps or vacuum may be an option to expedite delivery for appropriate maternal and fetal candidates and with a skilled delivery attendant. Cesarean delivery may be needed in some cases of labor prolongation and arrest, especially those occurring in the active phase of stage 1 of labor. For a prolonged third stage of labor, manual extraction of the placenta may be required.

**Protracted First Stage**

**Latent Phase**

- This phase can be prolonged for many hours and even days, hence the decision to admit the patient to the hospital depends on various factors, including the status of the cervix, the emotional state of the patient, associated complications, tolerance to pain, and the distance from the hospital. Therefore, it is imperative to discuss the options of admission versus continued outpatient management of the latent phase of labor.

- Therapeutic rest may be considered if desired. Morphine may be administered at a dose of 5 to 10 mg intramuscularly and intravenously simultaneously, with a maximum total dose of 20 mg. Alternatively, intramuscular morphine sulfate and promethazine may be utilized.

- Oxytocin and amniotomy may be helpful in treating prolonged latent phase

**Active Phase**

- For women in the active phase of the first stage, oxytocin may be administered and an amniotomy may be performed.

- If there has been no cervical change after four hours of adequate (>200 Montevideo units) uterine contractions or six hours without adequate uterine contractions, it is advisable to proceed with cesarean delivery.

- However, if labor is still progressing, either slowly or normally, oxytocin administration is continued.

**Protracted Second Stage**

- Oxytocin augmentation is begun for minimal (ie, <1 cm) or absent descent after 60 to 90 minutes of pushing and less frequent uterine contractions.

- In the absence of epidural anesthesia, nulliparous women can push for at least three hours and multiparous women for at least two hours before considering operative intervention. As long as the fetus continues to descend and/or rotate to a favorable position for spontaneous vaginal delivery and the fetal heart rate pattern is reassuring, any form of operative intervention should be delayed.

- Manual rotation of the fetus from occiput posterior presentation to occiput anterior presentation can be attempted if needed in a protracted second stage.

- In women who have epidural anesthesia, an additional hour of pushing may be allowed before considering operative intervention.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Chorioamnionitis

- Cervical stenosis

- Fetal malpresentation

- Leiomyomas

- Uterine contraction band

- Uterine Mullerian anomaly

# Prognosis

The prognosis of abnormal labor varies by which stage is abnormal. With an abnormal first-stage latent phase, intervention with amniotomy and oxytocin can be helpful and allow for normal progression of the remainder of labor. These same strategies may be utilized with abnormalities in the active phase of the first stage of labor. With an abnormal second stage of labor, again, oxytocin may be utilized. Operative vaginal delivery may also expedite the abnormal labor process in certain situations. Cesarean delivery may be indicated with abnormal labor in the first and second stages, based on recommended criteria. Modern methods to prevent injury, blood loss, and infection during cesarean delivery result in a good prognosis when operative delivery is necessitated.

# Complications

Roughly 20% of labors are associated with a protraction and/or arrest abnormality. A variety of adverse fetal and maternal outcomes are associated with labor abnormalities. Infection, operative birth, low Apgar score at 5 minutes, prolonged hospitalization for both mom and baby, third and fourth-degree maternal perineal tears, above-average blood loss, and NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) admission are all increased with abnormal labor progress.

With abnormal labor being the main indication for cesarean delivery during labor, the perceived safety of the cesarean delivery must be addressed. With the increasing rate of cesarean deliveries in the United States, there has been a concomitant increase in abnormal placentation, specifically placenta accreta and placenta previa as well as cesarean scar pregnancies. Along with this comes a paralleled increase in maternal morbidity and mortality, as placenta accreta and placenta previa account for a large percentage of maternal morbidity and mortality.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should be educated that they can be managed appropriately in labor, in order to avoid maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality due to protracted or arrested labor. Abnormal labor can be a daunting experience for women, especially during the first birth.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The best labor management requires a coordinated interprofessional effort between trained obstetric nurses, midwives, and physician providers. Labor is a dynamic process and the decision of the care team may change depending on the maternal and fetal factors. Since there is always a gray zone in treatment options, it is mandatory to include the patients in their treatment planning. Psychological and emotional support should also be provided, as these women with labor abnormalities are more likely to be diagnosed with post-partum blues. Team management may lower the average cesarean section rates and improve outcomes of labor overall. [Level V]
