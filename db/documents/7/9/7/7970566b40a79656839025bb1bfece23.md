Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare cause of proximal small bowel obstruction and is linked to significant morbidity and mortality when the diagnosis is delayed. Despite the rarity of this condition, the morbidity and mortality associated with its complications make it a crucial differential to consider when there is a concern for bowel obstruction, especially in the setting of recent weight loss. Conservative management for SMA syndrome often fails, and laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy proves to be safe and effective as optimal definitive treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Identify key history and physical exam features of superior mesenteric artery syndrome. 
- Explain which imaging modalities should be used to diagnose superior mesenteric artery syndrome.
- Outline treatment options for superior mesenteric artery syndrome. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of superior mesenteric artery syndrome and optimize outcomes.
