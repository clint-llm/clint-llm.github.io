Bone metastases occur mostly through the hematogenous spread. However local invasion from soft tissue tumors is also possible. Hematogenous spread through the venous system is the predominant process of spinal metastasis. This is because lung and breast cancers metastasize preferably in the thoracic region due to the venous drainage of the breast through the azygos vein as it communicates with the plexus of Batson in the thoracic region. Prostate cancer usually metastasizes to the lumbar-sacral spine and pelvis because it drains through the pelvic plexus in the lumbar region.

A pivotal occurrence in the pathogenesis of bone metastases involves the cellular interaction between the receptors on the tumor cells (e.g., CXCR4, RANKL) and the stromal cells of the bone marrow and bone matrix. These interactions subsequently lead to the release of growth factors, cytokines (IL-6, IL-8), and angiogenic factors (VEGF) leading to tumor growth and osteoclast activation and resultant osteolysis. The predilection for bone as a site of metastases is dependent on specific tumor characteristics, and the receptive bone microenvironment termed the seed and soil hypothesis.

Secondary bony involvement can be largely classified as osteoblastic (prostate cancer) and osteolytic (breast, lung, renal cancers) or mixed (breast cancer)
