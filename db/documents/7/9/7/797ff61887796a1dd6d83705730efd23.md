Patients with NTDs should present during prenatal screening and at-risk females should be counseled before conception to improve outcomes. However, in certain areas, especially underserved communities and those of low socio-economic background, may not have access to proper screening and may present at birth or in infancy. Standard prenatal screening includes serum AFP levels at 16-18 weeks to evaluate for NTD. Follow up can be obtained with ultrasound with a sensitivity of 88-89%.
