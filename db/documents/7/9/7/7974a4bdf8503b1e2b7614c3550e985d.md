To treat suspected bed bugs bites properly, patients must learn how to search for bedbug colonies, how to identify the bedbugs, and what products or extermination services should be used safely and effectively. Another key factor in the management of cases of bedbug bites is the prevention of future reinfestations of the same household. To avoid this, families should be taught how to reduce the risks such as avoiding used furniture and inspecting hotel room beds and luggage upon returning from trips.
