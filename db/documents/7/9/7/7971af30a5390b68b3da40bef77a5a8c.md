According to the International Standard ISO 6710, the light green cap contains lithium-heparin and is used for the hepatic function panel.

After the specimen is collected and fulfills the requirements, they go for testing. Hepatic function panels evaluate for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) through the use of blood samples. The quality of blood specimens is vital to decrease laboratory errors, prevent diagnosis delay, and ensure a proper diagnosis.

A hemolysis index assesses the sample at specific wavelengths to determine the potential concentration of cell-free hemoglobin and ensure quality. If the hemolysis index is unavailable, then a visual inspection should be conducted instead.
