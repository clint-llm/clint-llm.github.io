Fournier gangrene is a rare infection that constitutes <0.02% of all hospital admissions. It has a strong predilection for males as opposed to females, with a 10 to 1 ratio. The incidence in males is 1.6 cases per 100,000 men.

While less common in females, women tend to be more acutely ill at presentation, are twice as likely to require mechanical ventilation and dialysis, have a longer average length of hospitalization, and have a higher fatality rate than male patients.

While Fournier gangrene can appear in healthy individuals (26% to 30%), it is typically associated with a debilitated or immunocompromised state. It is most commonly seen in male diabetics over 50 years of age who have a history of alcohol abuse.

Known risk factors for Fournier gangrene include:

- Atherosclerosis

- Chemotherapy

- Chronic alcohol abuse (25% to 50% of cases)

- Chronic steroid use

- Colorectal malignancy

- Diabetes (20% to 70% of cases)

- Drug abuse (especially if injected directly into inguinal veins or the penis)

- HIV infection

- Immunosuppression

- Inflammatory bowel disease

- Leukemia

- Liver failure, cirrhosis

- Male gender (90% of cases)

- Malnutrition

- Neurogenic bladder

- Obesity

- Perianal abscess

- Peripheral vascular disease

- Prostate cancer

- Recent trauma or surgery (prostate biopsy, catheterization, cystoscopy)

- Rectal fistula

- Renal failure

- Significant cardiac disease

- Spinal cord injury

- Urethral strictures

- Use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (glycosuric medications used in patients with diabetes)

Despite the worldwide advances in treating sepsis, the mortality rate for Fournier gangrene has generally remained stable at 40%.
