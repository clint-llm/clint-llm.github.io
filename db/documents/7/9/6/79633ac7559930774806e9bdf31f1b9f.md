The primary organs in Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome demonstrating histologic changes are the liver and brain. Neural tissue from the cerebral cortex shows spongiosis, neuronal loss, and astrocytosis. These findings correlate with the progressive cognitive decline seen with the progression of the disease. The hepatic findings are more specific to AHS. A minimum of three of the following eight criteria must be present, in the absence of Wilson disease: bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, bile ductular proliferation, the collapse of liver plate cells, hepatocyte dropout or focal necrosis with or without portal inflammation, microvesicular steatosis, oncocytic change, regenerative nodules, and parenchymal disease or disorganization of the normal lobular architecture.
