IOP is determined by a delicate equilibrium between aqueous humor production and outflow. Elevated IOP can arise from increased production and/or decreased outflow mechanisms. The most common cause of elevated IOP in glaucoma is reduced aqueous humor outflow. Many forms of glaucoma are defined by elevated IOP, including primary open-angle glaucoma (the most frequent), closed-angle glaucoma, and secondary glaucoma (i.e., steroid-induced, pseudoexfoliation, traumatic, pigment dispersion glaucoma, etc.), and congenital glaucoma.

Most forms of open-angle glaucoma are silent sight-threatening diseases considering that central visual acuity tends not to be influenced, there is no associated pain or irritation, and peripheral visual field loss normally occurs gradually over numerous years in eyes with high IOP. Asymptomatic chronic elevated IOP leads to irreversible glaucomatous optic neuropathy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and visual field damage. Tonometry is of great importance in the screening, diagnosis, and management of all patients, especially those with risk factors for developing glaucoma.
