The symptoms of an acute overdose onset are usually delayed because of the delayed and erratic absorption of carbamazepine in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It causes dizziness, imbalance, drowsiness, coma, and generalized seizures. It can cause abnormal cardiac conduction that can lead to arrhythmia. It has been reported that acute carbamazepine toxicity could be associated with the presence of spindle coma on EEG. Anticholinergic symptoms are common with carbamazepine toxicity. Hyperchromic anemia, and minor rhabdomyolysis, as well as resultant movement disorders, also have been reported.
