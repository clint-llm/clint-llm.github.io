The exact mechanism of sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia remains controversial. Three distinct mechanisms are possible.

- The reentry circuit is existing primarily inside the sinoatrial node.

- The reentry circuit involves the sinoatrial node as a refractory center.

- The reentry circuit involves both the sinoatrial node and the perinodal tissue.

Most evidence suggests that the reentry circuit usually involves either just the sinoatrial node or both the sinoatrial node and the perinodal tissue. The theory of the sinoatrial node as a refractory center seems to lack much evidence.
