Contraindications for SMILE are largely similar to those of other laser refractive surgeries.

- SMILE should is not an option in patients with known corneal thinning disorders such as keratoconus or central corneal thickness (CCT) less than 475 micrometers to minimize the risk of postoperative ectasia.

- SMILE is not approved for patients with uncontrolled glaucoma or uveitis, significant cataract, corneal scarring, functional monocularity, active eye inflammation or infection, and severe dry eye or ocular allergy.

- Due to hormonal changes that may alter visual refraction, laser refractive procedures are not recommended in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

- History of herpes simplex keratitis may be considered a relative contraindication for SMILE, though the risk for reactivation may be minimized with preoperative and postoperative antiviral treatment.

- Other relative contraindications include irregular cornea or irregular corneal astigmatism, immunodeficiency, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, history of autoimmune disorders, and mild dry eye or ocular allergy.

- Caution should be taken in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, as this has been demonstrated to delay corneal wound healing.
