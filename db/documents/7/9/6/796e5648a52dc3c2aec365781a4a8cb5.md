Careful consideration of anatomical variations should be taken during clinical evaluation and surgical planning so as not to be mistaken for a neck mass. Knowledge of this possible occurrence is important for both the surgeon and the radiologist. The digastric muscles may be implicated in post-radiation dysphagia or swallowing dysfunction.

Exercises targeting the suprahyoid muscles, including the anterior belly of the digastric, are thought to help patients with dysphagia.

Calcification of the digastric muscle may be the cause (together with an alteration of the styloid ligament, such as length or calcification) of styloid process neuralgia; the latter is also known by the name long styloid process syndrome or Eagle syndrome. Muscle calcification could cause various symptoms, such as throat disorders, ear pain, and pharyngeal pain. The patient may have pain during tongue or head movements. In most clinical cases, surgery is necessary.

The digastric muscle is involved in the causes of pain relative to bruxism or the habit of clenching teeth. A myofunctional physiotherapy or speech therapy can reduce the electrical activity of the muscle during the movement of the jaw and reduce pain.

The digastric muscle in its posterior portion could be the site of a rare complication of otitis media: a Citelli abscess. The resolution is surgical.

The presence of trigger points in the digastric muscle can cause referred pain to the teeth. The therapy is of myofunctional type.
