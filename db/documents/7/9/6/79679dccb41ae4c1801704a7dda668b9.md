Hallux varus is a relatively common foot deformity seen in clinics. Because there is no good treatment, early diagnosis and changes in shoe wear are key. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a podiatrist, orthopedic surgeon, physical therapist and nurse practitioner. Changing shoe wear is beneficial but many patients have a significant deformity that requires surgery.

Surgery improves the overall position of the hallux but not necessarily its motion. Salvage procedures may be necessary and corrective iatrogenic hallux varus proceduresÂ are 60% to 80% effective.
