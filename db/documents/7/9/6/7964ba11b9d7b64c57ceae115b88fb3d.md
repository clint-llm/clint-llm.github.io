Plasmacytoma shows a few similarities with other diseases and hence needs to be differentiated from them. Differential diagnosis of plasmacytoma includes:

**Multiple Myeloma (MM)**

Multiple myeloma is a tumor of plasma cells. Plasmacytoma may progress to multiple myeloma over 2-3 years. Plasmacytoma is a localized bone disease and is further differentiated from multiple myeloma by the presence of CRABS (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, bone disease), multiple lytic bone lesions, end-organ damage, and serum or urinary monoclonal proteins.

**Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)**

NHL, in some cases, shows plasmacytic differentiation, which makes it difficult to differentiate them from plasmacytoma. In these cases, immunophenotyping can be used to differentiate these entities—plasma cells in lymphoma express CD19 and CD45. The phenotype of SPB lesion is similar to that of myeloma, but that of EMP lesion is similar to lymphomas suggesting that they may represent NHL with plasmacytic differentiation.

**Reactive Plasmacytosis******

It consists of follicular hyperplasia. There is no light chain restriction in reactive plasmacytosis as compared to plasmacytoma.

**Plasmablastic Lymphoma******

The tumor has plasmablastic morphology, often occurs in HIV-positive or immunosuppressed individuals. It occurs in the oral cavity or the mucosal surfaces of the head. It is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus.
