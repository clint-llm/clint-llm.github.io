Lymphomas are one of the common cancers of our immune system. It makes up to almost 5% of all cancers. It can affect both young and older adults. The common symptoms of this disease are persistent fevers, drenching night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and generalized or localized swelling of the lymph nodes. If any of these symptoms are observed, the primary care provider seeks a hematology consultation or opinion as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment, since timely identification and treatment of lymphomas result in better survival rates with the least number of complications.
