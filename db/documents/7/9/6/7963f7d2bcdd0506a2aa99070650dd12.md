COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory viral illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the broad-spectrum clinical manifestations associated with the involvement of multiple organs in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 is now considered a systemic illness. The immediate complications of COVID-19 are well defined and are often associated with increased mortality. However, delayed or long-term complications of COVID-19 are increasingly being recognized and are associated with increased morbidity. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the prevalence of delayed and long-term symptoms in patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.
- Describe the system-based manifestations of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.
- Summarize the methods to identify signs and symptoms of post-acute COVID-19 and discuss the management of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.

- Outline the importance of an interprofessional team approach in the management of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.
