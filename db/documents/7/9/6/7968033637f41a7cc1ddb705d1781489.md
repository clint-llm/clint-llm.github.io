The ability to immediately weight-bear is the ideal situation. With the advent of load sharing devices, such as an intramedullary nail, an overall decrease in patients requiring weight-bearing restrictions, is achievable. Improved technology of intramedullary implants is expanding the indications for distal fractures. Intramedullary nail fixation is a load sharing device and allows for immediate weight-bearing. Early ambulation and focused physical therapy limit the complications associated with immobilization and restricted weight-bearing. Periprosthetic distal femur fractures exclusively treated with plate fixation require weight-bearing restrictions for weeks to months. Postoperative patient immobilization drastically increases the complication risk associated with surgery, and avoidance of this limitation is one of the main indications for surgery.
