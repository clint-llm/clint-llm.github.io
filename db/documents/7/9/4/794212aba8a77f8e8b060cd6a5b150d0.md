Alpha-synuclein expression inducement occurs during neuronal development. It occurs after neuronal phenotype and the creation of synaptic connections. Additionally, alpha-synuclein levels fluctuate in conditions that alter neuroplasticity or result in neural injury.

In the human model, alpha-synuclein is present in the fetus since the fifteenth week of gestation; during the fetal period, the protein is present in all organs.
