Civilian patients with vascular injuries (central and peripheral) account for 1% to 2% of all injuries reported in trauma patients.  However, these injuries account for greater than 20% of all trauma-related deaths.

The reported rate of vascular injuries in the military setting has changed significantly since World War I (WWI) until the present.  The rate in WWI was reported to be 0.4% to 1.3% and in World War II 0.96%. The rate increased slightly during the Korean and Vietnam wars to a rate of 2% to 3%.  However, the rate increased to 12% during the recent tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Of these injuries, the extremities were the most commonly reported at 79%, with 66% of those occurring in the lower extremity.

Blunt vascular injuries more commonly occur within the torso secondary to motor vehicle accidents.  For the extremities, there are a few specific dislocations or fracture patterns that correlate with vascular injuries.  The injuries include supracondylar fracture of the humerus, posterior knee dislocation, or tibial plateau fracture. These injuries correlate with high morbidity and mortality.

Perkin et al.

Barmparas et al.

Konstantinidis et al. noted that geriatric patients (>65 years old) make up a small percentage (7.6%) of vascular trauma. Blunt trauma is by far a more common cause of vascular injuries in this population as penetrating injuries account for only 16.1% of all injuries.  Males (60.8%) still account for a majority of vascular trauma with the mean age being 70.7 years old.  The overall incidence of trauma-related vascular injuries is 0.7%.  The four most common mechanisms for traumatic vascular injuries are once again MVC, firearms, stabbing and falls.  MVC account for 59.2% of vascular injuries in this population.  The most common vascular injury occurs within the chest.  When penetrating vascular injuries occur, they are more common in the neck or the upper extremity.  There is no difference in the amputation rate.  If an upper extremity amputation is required the most frequently injured vessel is the brachial artery.  Similar to pediatric patients, geriatric patients undergo few fasciotomies in comparison to the adult population.  Geriatric patients have an increased mortality associated with vascular trauma.  These patients have a 4-fold higher mortality rate and are more likely to perish in the emergency room, as 10% will do so verus 5.3% of the general adult population.  When admitted to the hospital these patients have a slightly longer ICU stay (9.4 days vs. 8 days) but their length of hospitalization is no different than that of a general adult.
