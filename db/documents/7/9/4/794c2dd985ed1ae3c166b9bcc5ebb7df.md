Under aseptic precaution, the target nerve is identified using fluoroscopy, ultrasound, or nerve stimulation. A local anesthetic is infiltrated at the skin. The needle, radiofrequency probe, or cryoprobe is advanced toward the target nerve, and after a preliminary aspiration, a diagnostic block with a local anesthetic may be performed to confirm position, and subsequently, neurolysis (e.g., injection of alcohol or phenol, RFA, among others) can be performed. Typically, diagnostic blocks are performed before neurolytic intervention to allow better prediction of efficacy. Cardiovascular monitoring with resuscitative backup should be readily available. Patients should be counseled that the therapeutic effect from neurolysis, particularly chemical neurolysis, may not be evident for 3 to 7 days.
