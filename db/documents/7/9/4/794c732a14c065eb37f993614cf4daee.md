Mucous membrane graft is a simple and viable option for the ocular surface reconstruction in patients with severe cicatrizing disorders like thermal injury, Steven Johnson's syndrome, and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. They have also been used for the reconstruction of the severely contracted socket. The techniqueÂ for harvesting labial mucosal graft is simple, easily accessible, and can be easily performed by an ophthalmologist. Moreover, the site is easily accessible, and there is no scarcity of donor grafts. Oral mucosa is thick and remains stable, thus minimizing the recurrences.
