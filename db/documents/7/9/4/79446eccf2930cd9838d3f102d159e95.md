Here are some important points to remember:

- Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare developmental malformation of lungs.

- The main etiology is the deficient development of bronchial cartilages leading to overinflation of the affected lobe.

- CLE usually presents with respiratory distress, wheezing, rhonchi, cyanosis, and difficulty in feeding.

- Chest x-ray and CT-scan are used for diagnosis.

- The best treatment in severe cases is lobectomy.

- Congenital lobar emphysema usually has a good prognosis even in patients with severe symptoms after lobectomy.
