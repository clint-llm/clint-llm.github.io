There is no effective treatment to stop or revert ASAS. The use of high dose corticosteroids for patients with ASAS is ineffective, and few reports have shown mild improvement, while most of them show no improvement.

Treatment is usually supportive and focused on treating acute and late symptoms or complications.

- Fluid/vasopressors: for neurogenic hypotension.

- Mechanical ventilation: for the involvement of phrenic nerve and dysfunction of the diaphragm in high cervical lesions

- Bladder catheterization: for neurogenic urinary retention.

- Deep venous thrombosis prevention prophylaxis.

- Pressure sores prevention.

- Gastrointestinal stress ulcer prevention.

- Physical, occupational, and psychological therapy

The goal of the treatment of ASAS focuses on treating the underlying etiology behind the development of ASAS. Current treatment follows the same guidelines for cerebral ischemia, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and acute traumatic spinal cord injury.
