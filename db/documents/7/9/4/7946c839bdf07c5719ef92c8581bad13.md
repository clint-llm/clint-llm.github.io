Deterrence is dependent on proper screening criteria for early signs of potential addiction as well as early childhood education. School programs such as DARE represent a positive effort to curb drug use and experimentation before it becomes a problem. However, patient education, while it is most effective prior to the development of health problems, has a place at any stage of addiction. As stated above, patients are more likely to reach and maintain abstinence and institute positive lifestyle changes if physicians and other health care professionals engage in consistent and positive encouragement of the patient.
