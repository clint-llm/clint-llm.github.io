Basal body temperature tracking has been a natural and straightforward tool women have used for decades to determine the cessation of ovulation. Since the discovery of the physiology behind BBT, women have been able to use the information for intercourse planning. Whether used as an aid in identifying a fertile period or rather to prevent conception, the natural tool has proven somewhat advantageous. However, various studies have expressed the viewpoint that basal body temperature measurement is an unreliable technique to determine accurate ovulation timing.
