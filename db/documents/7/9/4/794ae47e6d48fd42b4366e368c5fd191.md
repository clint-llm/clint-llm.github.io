Complications of atrioventricular reentry tachycardia itself are rare and are similar to the complications of any rapid tachycardia resulting in pre-syncope or syncope, chest pain or shortness of breath. As discussed above, the most dreaded complication of an individual with an accessory pathway is sudden cardiac death, but thankfully this is rare. Complications from radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway occur in 2 to 4 percent of cases. Information gathered from a national registry that reported 3357 patients, of those who underwent accessory pathway ablation, found that complications include cardiac tamponade, acute MI, femoral artery pseudoaneurysms, AV block, pneumothorax, and pericarditis. In this registry, all of these complications occurred less than 2% of the time.
