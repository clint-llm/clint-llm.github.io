Patients with chronic viral hepatitis, deranged liver function tests, the presence of indolent non-resolving upper abdominal symptoms, and space-occupying liver lesions should seek consultation for further evaluations by a hepatologist. A CT scan in the majority of cases is diagnostic; however, a biopsy is often necessary for an absolute diagnosis in suspicious cases. A hematologist is always required to guide and institute further therapy, notably the combination of chemotherapy. Most patients with primary hepatic lymphoma are responsive to combination chemotherapy, and the 5-year survival exceeds more than 80%.
