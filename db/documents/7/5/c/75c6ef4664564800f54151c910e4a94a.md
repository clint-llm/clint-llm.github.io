It is imperative to have a thorough and systematic approach when assessing lower eyelid laxity. This must include an assessment of the general medical condition and examination of the eyelid.

It is important to make sure that the patient is fit for surgery from a medical perspective. Proper history-taking should elicit any significant medical comorbidities that may affect the choice of anesthesia as patients with extensive comorbidities may not be suitable for general anesthesia. A history of frequent use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines should be noted as it predisposes to postoperative malar edema. Moreover, any bleeding disorder or medications that influence the bleeding tendency should be documented and optimized before surgery if possible.

Dry eye is a common postoperative complication because of the transient impairment of eye closure and blinking mechanisms. The patient should be asked about the history of frequent tearing, ocular discomfort or gritty sensation, and excessive blinking. Further assessment may be needed to elicit the etiology, which may be an allergy, collagen disease, Sjögren syndrome, Graves disease, or incomplete recovery of facial nerve palsy. A Schirmer test is useful to quantify the degree of dryness.
