Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequently-occurring extracranial childhood tumor. It is classified as an embryonal neuroendocrine tumor, originating from neural crest progenitor cells. Hence, it can occur anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system, including the superior cervical, paraspinal, and celiac ganglia; the majority arise in the adrenal glands. Due to the high variability in its presentation, clinical signs and symptoms at presentation can range from benign palpable mass with distension to major illness from substantial tumor spread. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of neuroblastoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of neuroblastoma.
- Review the presentation of neuroblastoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for neuroblastoma.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by neuroblastoma.
