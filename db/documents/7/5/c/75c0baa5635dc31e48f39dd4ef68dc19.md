This shoulder girdle contains the glenohumeral joint which is a ball-and-socket joint. The humeral head and the glenoid fossa of the scapula form an articulation that is extremely shallow; the glenoid is approximately 1/3 the size of the humeral head. The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body allowing for the largest amount of range of motion. The shallowness of the joint, while allowing for great mobility, also contributes to the joint’s instability. The cartilaginous labrum that runs around the rim of the glenoid helps to deepen the socket and improve stability along with the joint capsule, ligaments and muscular attachments. The nerves of the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels run along the anterior shoulder girdle between the first rib and clavicle and can be prone to injury, but this is much less common in posterior dislocations. Dislocations can occur with any injury to the shoulder, whether it be traumatic, blunt, or a twisting type of injury. The most common mechanism is a forceful adduction with internal rotation, but a direct, blunt blow to the anterior shoulder may also result in dislocation. Any unexplained nocturnal posterior dislocation should prompt one to consider a seizure.
