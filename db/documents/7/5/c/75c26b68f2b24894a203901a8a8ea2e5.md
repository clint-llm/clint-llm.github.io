Hepcidin plays a role in innate immunity through its interactions with IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. The ability to sequester iron within cells to prevent its availability for pathogenic or neoplastic growth appears to be largely dependent on hepcidin stimulation by IL-6. This innate defense may help protect against many pathogens, including streptococcal and malarial species.

Several hepcidin agonists are currently in development and may become a viable treatment for hereditary hemochromatosis. Currently, phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment for iron overload states, but a hepcidin agonist could help alleviate the symptoms from the deficient natural hepcidin.

Hepcidin plays a central role in iron transport and utilization and is, therefore, an important marker of iron bioavailability.
