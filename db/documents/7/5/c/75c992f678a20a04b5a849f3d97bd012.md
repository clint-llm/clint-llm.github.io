Triamcinolone injections are strongly contraindicated for epidural administration due to serious medical adverse effects, including paralysis, cortical blindness, and death. Additionally, prolonged use of glucocorticoids may lead to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression.

Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus should use caution when systemically dosing triamcinolone (as with all corticosteroids) due to its hyperglycemic adverse effect. A higher incidence of skin atrophy is noted with glucocorticoid use in the elderly population due to aging. Patients diagnosed with psychosis should also use extreme caution as triamcinolone may cause exacerbation of related symptoms.

Corticosteroids are known to exacerbate glaucoma; thus, primary care physician supervision is necessary.
