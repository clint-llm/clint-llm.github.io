**Anti-inflammatory properties of Baricitinib**

Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus Kinases (JAK) JAK1 and JAK2 originally approved for use in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Its use has been justified by proven dampening of the inflammatory response

**Antiviral Activity of Baricitinib**

The potential antiviral activity of Baricitinib is embedded in the mechanism of viral cell entry of several viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The virus gains entry into the cells by a process known as clathrin-mediated endocytosis

**Evidence**

To categorize and interpret the current evidence in the context of COVID-19 therapy, it is important to discuss the 8-point ordinal scale which categorizes COVID-19 based on disease severity. **Figure 3**depicts the widely accepted 8-point ordinal scale for COVID 19 severity and clinical improvement. The scores ranging from 4 to 7 include hospitalized individuals requiring some form of oxygen supplementation, with incremental severity based on oxygen requirements, and supportive care. Goletti and Cantini

The Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial investigators on the other hand evaluated the utility of using dexamethasone in hospitalized individuals

Based on the findings of the abovementioned trials, Goletti and Cantini extrapolate that Remdesivir is most effective in early disease with an ordinal scale of 4-5 and dexamethasone is more effective in the later course of the disease with an ordinal scale of 6-7. They point out a need to evaluate therapy for the so-called “Grey Zone” or individuals with an ordinal scale severity of 5-6.

Kalil et al in their recent study the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial -2 (ACTT-2)

A limitation to the interpretation of the ACTT-2 trial is the absence of data on concurrent use with corticosteroids, as this trial was conducted before the results of the RECOVERY trial. Rodriguez -Garcia et al performed an observational study comparing the use of a combination of Baricitinib with corticosteroids vs steroids alone
