Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent phospholipid mediator that was first described by its ability to cause platelet aggregation and dilation of blood vessels. Now it is also known as a potent mediator of inflammation, allergic responses, and shock. It causes a dramatic inflammation of air passage resulting in asthmalike symptoms. Production of PAF is inducable by toxins from fragments of destroyed bacteria leading to vasodilation and a drop in blood pressure resulting in reduced cardiac output and shock.

Platelets, endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils continuously produce PAF in low quantity. PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), also known as Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), inactivates the PAF and PAF-like phospholipids, controlling their actions.
