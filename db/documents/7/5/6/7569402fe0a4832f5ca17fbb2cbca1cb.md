The diagnostic workup for hypothalamic dysfunction depends on the patient's clinical condition, signs, and symptoms. Typical workup includes blood and urine laboratory tests such as:

- Serum cortisol

- Serum estrogen

- Pituitary hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin)

- Testosterone

- Thyroid hormones

- Sodium levels

- Blood and urine osmolality

Other diagnostic tests include:

- Brain imaging: magnetic resonance imaging (gold standard) orÂ computed tomographic scan (for emergency cases)

- Visual field test

- Genetic analysis

- Autoimmune markers
