Many physiological variants may manifest in the upper extremity. These variations are often a cause for concern because they may lead to a misdiagnosis. The following are a few that may occur.

Under normal anatomical circumstances, the extensor indicis (EI) arises from the dorsal aspect of the distal part of the ulna and interosseous membrane. It inserts into the expansion hood of the index finger. It may present as a double tendon and lead to clinical symptoms within the hand.

The flexor digitorum superficialis typically originates from the medial epicondyle, coronoid process, and anterior aspect of the radius. It inserts at the base of the middle phalanx of the second, third, fourth, and fifth phalanges. There have been reports of the flexor digitorum superficialis with two muscle bellies, which may lead to volar forearm compression and pain.

The extensor digitorum brevis manus is a variant muscle locatedÂ in the dorsum of the hand. It leads to a variation of the fourth extensor compartment within the hand.
