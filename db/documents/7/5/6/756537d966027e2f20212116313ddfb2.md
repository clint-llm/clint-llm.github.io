Most thyroid nodules are benign. Concern for malignancy is increased by initial findings such as normal to high serum TSH level, history of irradiation or MEN, and some ultrasonographic features, including microcalcifications and irregular margins hypoechogenicity, taller-than-wide shape, and vascularity.

The prognosis for thyroid malignancy will greatly vary depending on the histological type and subtype of cancer in addition to several individual characteristics, including age at diagnosis, size of the primary tumor, presence of soft tissue invasion, or distant metastasis.

Most patients with papillary thyroid cancer do not die of the disease. One case series on patients with non-metastatic papillary thyroid cancer showed malignancy-related mortality of 6%.

Other factors associated with an increase of malignancy recurrence or death include male gender, mediastinal lymph node involvement, delay in primary surgical therapy of more than 1 year after detection of a nodule, and multicentricity of the intrathyroidal tumor.

Follicular cancer generally occurs in older patients and follows an aggressive course. It is commonly associated with distant metastasis and higher mortality than papillary thyroid cancer.
