As stated above, phenelzine is a potent, nonselective monoamine oxidase A and B inhibitor (MAOI): phenelzine irreversibly these enzymes, preventing serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine from being broken down, allowing these neurotransmitters to have a more prolonged effect on their target receptors. It also increases levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the brain.

Monoamine oxidase is a complex enzyme system, and medications that inhibit monoamine oxidase in vitro demonstrate a variety of clinical effects. It remains unclear whether the observed clinical effects result from monoamine oxidase inhibition per see, other pharmacological actions, or the interplay of both. Clinicians considering using these agents need to familiarize themselves with all the potential effects associated with this class of medications.

Phenelzine has recently been studied concerning its potential neuroprotective and regenerative properties. This research has examined the effect of phenelzine and other MAOI agents on GABA-glutamate balance in the brain, sequestering of reactive aldehydes, and inhibition of primary amine oxidase. Phenelzine has also shown encouraging findings in animal models for stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. These actions and indications will require further study but represent a clinically intriguing possibility for these agents in the future.
