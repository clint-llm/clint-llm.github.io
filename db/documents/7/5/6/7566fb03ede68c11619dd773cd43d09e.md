No additional monitoring is necessary with the use of silver sulfadiazine in otherwise healthy patients. Electrolytes, serial urinalyses, renal function studies, and complete blood counts require monitoring in those patients with extensive burns, which will require intensive care. This monitoring is partly because burn injuries can result in extensive loss of free water and, therefore, electrolyte disturbances.

Some silver sulfadiazine formulations contain propylene glycol, which can undergo absorption and reportedly causes serum osmolality disturbances. Serum propylene glycol levels may be obtained as well in certain situations.
