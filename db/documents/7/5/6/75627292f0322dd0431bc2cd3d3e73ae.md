Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in the treatment of several gram-negative infections. It should be indicated based on patient age, symptoms, signs at presentation, and local antimicrobial resistance patterns to enhance the probability of successful treatment in bacterial septicemia, meningitis, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal tract infections, and soft tissue infections. This activity aims to review the indications, action mechanism, and contraindications for gentamicin as a relevant agent in the therapy of nosocomial and community-acquired infections. This activity will also highlight the main administration routes, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring) pertinent to the healthcare team in using gentamicin.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of gentamicin.
- Describe the adverse effects of gentamicin.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for toxicity of gentamicin.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance patient safety and treatment outcomes using gentamicin.
