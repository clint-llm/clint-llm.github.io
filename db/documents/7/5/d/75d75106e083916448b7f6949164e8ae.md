Acute radiation syndrome can result from direct exposure or contamination by radioactive materials. Direct exposure can be caused by a nuclear blast, while contamination can result from the ingestion of nuclear-contaminated food, water and skin contact with the nuclear material. Acute radiation syndrome is divided into three groups: hematopoietic, gastrointestinal and cardiac/neurological systems. Each system will require a different dose of radiation to manifest the symptoms of acute radiation syndrome. The timing of symptoms is also subdivided into a prodrome, latent and manifest phases. The dose, symptom onset, and acute radiation syndrome subdivision are tabled below.
