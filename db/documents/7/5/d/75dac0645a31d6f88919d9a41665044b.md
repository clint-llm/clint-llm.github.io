Though relapse rates for PAN are lower than the ANCA-associated vasculitides, relapse rates remain high.

The prognosis is best for patients who only have skin involvement, but the risk of relapse is still present. Patients with hepatitis B who seroconvert have a low risk of relapse and usually recover.

Without treatment, anywhere from 10%-20% of patients die within 5 years, with 50% dying within the first 3 months. With corticosteroid treatment, the 5-year survival ranges from 50%-60%. Deaths are usually due to complications of immunosuppressive therapy, stroke, bowel perforation, or myocardial infarction. The prognosis worse if patients have the following:

- Proteinuria (more than 1 g/day)

- Renal insufficiency

- Cardiomyopathy

- GI involvement

- CNS involvement
