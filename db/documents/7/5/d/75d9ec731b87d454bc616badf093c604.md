Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS) is one of a group of conditions characterized histologically by a lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis. The following four conditions, along with JLIS, are referred to as the 5 Lâ€™s:

Polymorphous Light Eruption (PLE)

- Active lesions during winter months or in areas that do not receive sun exposure can help distinguish JLIS from PLE.

Discoid Lupus Erythematosus/Lupus Erythematosus Tumidus

- ANA, anti-smith and double-stranded DNA tests can distinguish JLIS from lupus erythematosus

- Due to its autoimmune etiology, LET has a female predominance

- Less truncal involvement than JLIS

- JLIS tends to have a higher percentage of B lymphocytes on biopsy

Well-Differentiated Lymphocytic Lymphoma

- Lymphoma can have bone marrow involvement, while JLIS is confined to the skin

Lymphocytoma Cutis

- Lymphocytoma cutis usually has no detectable B cells

Other differential diagnoses are:

Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia

Granuloma annulare

Granuloma faciale

Gyrate erythema

Reticular erythematous mucinosis, it has positive Alcian blue staining for dermal mucin, which is negative in JLIS
