Lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) is an inflammatory eyelid condition that commonly occurs in association with various ocular surface diseases.Â LWE specifically involves the "lid wiper" region, which is the transitional zone between the marginal conjunctiva of the upper eyelid and the ocular surface during blinking. In LWE, inflammation affects the epithelial cells of the lid wiper, giving rise to a spectrum of signs and symptoms.

Common manifestations of LWE include lid marginal staining, which refers to the discoloration or staining of the marginal area of the eyelid, as well as ocular surface staining. Patients with LWE may also experience symptoms such as a foreign body sensation, burning or discomfort in the eyes, and blurred vision. These clinical features collectively indicate the presence of LWE and guide the diagnosis and management of this condition.
