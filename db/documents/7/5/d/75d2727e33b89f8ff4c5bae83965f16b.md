Motor neuron diseases are neurological disorders that affect the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease that affects both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons, resulting in profound muscle weakness and debility. This activity describes the findings of nerve conduction tests and needle electromyography and the indispensable role these findings serve in confirming a diagnosis of ALS and the importance of an interdisciplinary team approach in the treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the classification of motor neuron diseases, with a focus on the most common motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
- Discuss the clinical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
- Explain the indications for EMG for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
- Discuss the electrodiagnostic findings of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and its importance in diagnosis and management of the disease.
