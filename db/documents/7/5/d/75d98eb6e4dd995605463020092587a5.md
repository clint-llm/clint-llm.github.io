Injury to the IFP is usually the result of a single traumatic event or repetitive microtrauma due to blunt impact, shear injury with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, dislocation of the patella, or a twisting injury at the knee.

The IFP is a potent source of pain due to its robust innervation by nociceptive Type IVa-free nerve endings and fibers targeted by substance P.

The scar tissue gradually accumulates and impinges at the intercondylar notch and trochlea, leading to a mechanical and/or painful block to full extension.
