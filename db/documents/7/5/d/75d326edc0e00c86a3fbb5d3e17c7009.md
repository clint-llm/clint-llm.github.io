Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also called acne inversus, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with lesions including deep-seated nodules and abscesses, draining tracts, and fibrotic scars. These lesions most commonly occur in intertriginous areas and areas rich in apocrine glands. Among the most common are the axillary, groin, perianal, perineal, and inframammary locations. Treatment varies based on severity and can include topical and systemic antibiotics, hormone therapy, immune modulators, and surgery. Because of the associated pain, sensitive locations, drainage, odor, and scarring, this condition may have a negative psychosocial impact.
