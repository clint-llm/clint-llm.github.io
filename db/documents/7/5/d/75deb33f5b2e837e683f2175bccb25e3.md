Cystic fibrosis is a systemic illness that has broad implications for both quality and quantity of life when poorly controlled. Therefore, treatment should focus on optimizing function to avoid acute illness events. This should target maintaining lung function by aggressively controlling respiratory infection and clearing airways of mucus, optimizing nutritional status with pancreatic enzyme supplements and multivitamins, and finally, by managing any other health complications that may arise. This is best performed when using a team approach of specialists who are experienced in managing cystic fibrosis. Specialties that may be part of the team include pulmonologists, infectious disease, and gastroenterology. Nurses monitor patients and facilitate team communication. Pharmacists review all medications, check for drug-drug interactions, and educate patients and their families about the importance of compliance and potential side effects. [Level 5] Lung infections continue to have the highest mortality rates. For children who undergo a lung transplant, survival is increased for 6-8 years, but without a lung transplant, most children are dead within a few years.
