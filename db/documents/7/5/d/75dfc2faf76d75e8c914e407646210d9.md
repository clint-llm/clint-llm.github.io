As the clinical presentation for pneumonia and, therefore, staphylococcal pneumonia is broad and nonspecific, so is the differential for this process. Differential diagnosis may include:

- Pneumonia secondary to:

- 
              
- Streptococcal pneumonia 
              
              
- Nontypeable Haemophilus influenza 
              
              
- Mycoplasma pneumonia 
              
              
- Chlamydia pneumonia 
              
              
- Legionella 
              
              
- Gram-negative bacilli 
              
              
- Group A Streptococcus 
              
              
- Anaerobic infection 
              
              
- Mycoplasma tuberculosis 
              
              
- Viral infection

- Pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart failure

- Pulmonary hemorrhage

- Atelectasis

- Pneumonitis from aspiration or chemical exposure

- Interstitial lung disease

- Drug reaction

- Pulmonary embolism
