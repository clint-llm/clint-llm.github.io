The first step in considering a diagnosis within the broad scope of photosensitivity is to consider each category of photosensitivity and the specific entities within the given category; whether it is primary photosensitivity such as polymourphous light eruption, autoimmune photosensitivity such as lupus erythematosus, photo-exacerbated or aggravated such as dermatomyositis, genetic such as xeroderma pigmentosum, or metabolic such as porphyria cutanea tarda. Then using the history and physical exam, narrow down the differential. For example, a polymourphous light eruption(PMLE) may be distinguised from lupus erythematosus by the history, presentation, and clinical appearance of these lesions. For photoexacerbated diseases such as dermatomyositis, other clinical findings such as capillary abnormalities around the nail folds or gottron papules over the bony prominences usually help with distinction from other entities such as drug enduced photosensitivity. Once the general category has been suspected, a differential can be developed within that category and helps with the diagnosis. For the differential diagnosis of each entity, please see the specific chapter of that entity.
