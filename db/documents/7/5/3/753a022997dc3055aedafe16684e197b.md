Yolk sac tumors (also known as endodermal sinus tumors) are malignant primitive germ cell tumors; they are histologically similar to the mesenchyma of the primitive yolk sac. Yolk sac tumors can be found in a pure form or mixed with other germ cell tumors. They are common in the pediatrics age group and can be found anywhere in the body. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of the yolk sac tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of yolk sac tumors.
- Review the pathophysiology of yolk sac tumors.
- Summarize the evaluation and treatment of yolk sac tumors.
- Explain the evaluation and treatment of the yolk sac tumors and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
