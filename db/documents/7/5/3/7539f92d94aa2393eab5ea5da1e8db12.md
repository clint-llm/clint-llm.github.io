Medial epicondylitis, while less common than lateral epicondylitis, accounts for 10% to 20% of all epicondylitis.

Risk factors for developing medial epicondylitis in athletes include training errors, improper technique, equipment, or functional risk factors including lack of strength, endurance, or flexibility.
