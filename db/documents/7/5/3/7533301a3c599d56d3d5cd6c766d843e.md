Physicians and medical researchers have a moral and legal obligation to obtain informed consent. Informed consent must include the patient being competent and understanding the options, risks, and benefits. For pediatric patients, parental consent, or consent from a surrogate, must be obtained for medical procedures, treatment, or research. When reasonable, pediatric assent is also a vital part of a positive physician-patient relationship that engages the child in their care. To avoid legal and ethical issues, this activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in obtaining informed consent from parents.
