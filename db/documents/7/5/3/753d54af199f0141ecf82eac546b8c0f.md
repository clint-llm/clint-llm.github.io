Pulmonary barotrauma secondary to mechanical ventilation is a condition that commonly presents in the ICU. It carries high morbidity and mortality. The ICU nurses caring for patients on ventilators must be fully aware of barotrauma and how to respond. The condition can result in a life-threatening tension pneumothorax and lead to death within minutes. Nurses need to assess the patient's ventilatory parameters, frequently palpate the chest for crepitus, and check the chest X-ray. A chest tube kit should be available if patient management uses a high PEEP. The nurses need to have rapid and open communication access to the interprofessional team.

Patients with barotrauma remain on mechanical ventilation and in the ICU for an extended period. It is difficult to diagnose pulmonary barotrauma since most patients are unable to communicate. Hemodynamic changes and evidence of respiratory distress usually occur after major complications from barotrauma have already happened, such as a pneumothorax. Due to the difficulty in diagnosis, a high degree of suspicion is necessary. It is important for physicians to obtain a thorough medical history, monitor the ventilatory pressures, and carefully look at chest radiographs to identify patients at risks for barotrauma before significant complications occur.  Physicians and nurses should have rounds in each patient in the ICU, and the ventilatory parameters should be discussed. No one except for the critical care physician or respiratory therapist should make ventilator changes. Each ventilator change must be recorded in the logbook, and all staff notified.

Only through open communication between clinicians and nursing staff can the morbidity of barotrauma be lowered. [Level V]
