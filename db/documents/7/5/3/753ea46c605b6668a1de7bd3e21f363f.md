The management of malignant tumors in an area such as the orbit can be quite complicated. A thorough discussion is necessary to inform the patient of the potential causes, treatments, adverse events, and prognosis of both the disease processes involved and the treatment options. Whenever cancer is being discussed as a diagnosis, it is critical to approach the patient and situation with compassion and empathy. At times this may necessitate multiple discussions so the patient can process the information appropriately and make an informed decision.

The risks, benefits, and alternatives of any treatment (or lack of treatment) should be thoroughly explained. The emotional and psychological impact of the diagnoses involved and the treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, long-term monitoring for recurrence, etc.) and especially any complications that arise may require multi-specialty attention from a primary care provider, oncologist, psychologist, or psychiatrist.
