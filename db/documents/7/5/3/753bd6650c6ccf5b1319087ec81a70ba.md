Immediate management of TRALI is to stop the transfusion and notify the blood bank to screen the donor unit for antileukocyte antibodies, anti-HLA or anti-neutrophil-specific antibodies.

Once the transfusion is stopped, gradual recovery may take 2-4 days. The chest x-ray will improve within 2-5 days.
