The amount of displacement drives the proper treatment of a Tillaux fracture. Regardless of which treatment option is adopted, an anatomic reduction is the main target. Ideally, with little displacement as < 2 mm, the fracture can be managed **non-operatively**with closed reduction and immobilization in a cast. Closed reduction is usually achieved by foot internal rotation. Alternatively, the reduction can be attempted by dorsiflexion and pronation of the foot followed by an internal rotation. This is usually accompanied by the application of a short leg cast with the ankle slightly inverted to help maintain the fracture reduction. Casting is usually for 4 weeks non-weight bearing followed by additional 2 weeks in a walker boot to allow ankle range of motion.

Fractures that are displaced > 2 mm with disruption of articular congruity of the distal tibia need to be considered for **operative management**as per the following:

**Closed Reduction and Percutaneous Pinning (CRPP):**Reduction can be achieved as mentioned above or by using a K-wire in the fracture fragment as a joystick. The quality of reduction can be evaluated intraoperatively either by fluoroscopy or arthrogram. If a reduction is satisfactory, the fracture is fixed with K-wires or cannulated screws across the epiphysis parallel to the articular surface.

**Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):**Anterolateral approach is used to allow direct visualization of the articular surface for optimal reduction. The fracture is reduced with internal rotation and the reduction is held with either transepiphyseal K wires or periarticular clamp. Fixation is with either K wires or cannulated screws across the epiphysis. Children who develop Tillaux fracture are usually approaching skeletal maturity, so crossing the physis will rarely affect remaining growth. Fracture fixation is usually augmented with cast or splints for 4 weeks followed by a walker boot for additional 2 weeks to allow ankle range of motion exercises.

**Arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation:**The anterolateral portal is usually used. It allows direct anatomic reduction of the fracture with minimal intervention.
