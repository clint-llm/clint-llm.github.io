**History and physical examination**are usually sufficient to diagnose quadriceps tendon ruptures, and imaging is generally not necessary.

**Ultrasound**is the diagnostic modality of choice. It can be used to detect a tendon defect and to assess the degree of tendon gap with knee flexion.

**Plain radiographs**are usually not helpful in making this diagnosis but may have some clinical utility in ruling out other associated injuries or conditions. Plain radiography may help determine patellar position. A patella Alta (high-riding patella) may indicate a patellar tendon rupture, while a patella Baja (an inferior riding patella) may suggest a quadriceps tendon rupture. Plain radiography may also rule in or out associated patella avulsions or other associated patellar fractures.

**MRI**has high sensitivity and specificity to detect quadriceps tendon rupture.
