**Cartilage Changes in Aging**

- Water content – decreased

- Collagen – same

- Proteoglycan content – decreased

- Proteoglycan synthesis – same

- Chondrocyte size – increased

- Chondrocyte number – decreased

- Modulus of elasticity – increased

**Cartilage Changes in OA**

- Water content – increased

- Collagen – disorganized

- Proteoglycan content – decreased

- Proteoglycan synthesis – increased

- Chondrocyte size – same

- Chondrocyte number – same

- Modulus of elasticity – decreased

**Matrix Metalloproteases**

Responsible for cartilage matrix degradation

- Stromelysin

- Plasmin

- Aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4)

- Collagenase

- Gelatinase

**Tissue Inhibitors of MMPs**

Control MMP activity preventing excess degradation

- TIMP-1

- TIMP-2

- Alpha-2-macroglobulin
