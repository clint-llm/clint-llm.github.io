Blood supply is critical to medial meniscal healing. The medial meniscus receives its vascular supply primarily from the medial, lateral, and middle genicular arteries. These are branches of the popliteal artery, a continuation of the femoral artery.

The capillary network formed by these arteries supplies the superior and inferior portions of the medial meniscus. It is worth noting that only 10 to 30% of the medial meniscus receives a direct blood supply.

The absence of a direct blood supply to the majority of the medial meniscus contributes to the challenges in healing a torn meniscus during post-operative recovery.
