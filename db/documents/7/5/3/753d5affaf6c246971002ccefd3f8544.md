The spinal cord is also the distinction between the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. Its main function is to mediate homeostasis. This involves the use of the neurotransmitters are the primary signals to aid in propagating nerve impulses. In addition, the spinal cord plays the role of an integrator of information. The tracts in the white matter carry impulses to and from the brain while the gray matter of the cord contains cell bodies.

The spinal cord is the location where electrical signals are converted to physical voluntary and involuntary responses. They propagate these through the major neurotransmitters, glutamate, GABA, and glycine.
