The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride are effective medications in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia. Since these medications have a prolonged time before symptomatic relief is appreciated, patient education by providers is essential in maintaining adherence.  Patients receiving treatment with the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors should be informed of potential side effects and screened for prostate cancer regularly while receiving these medications.
