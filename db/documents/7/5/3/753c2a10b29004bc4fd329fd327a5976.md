Tietze syndrome is described as a localized, painful, swollen, non-pustular mass commonly without rubor or erythema. It is most often associated with the cartilage of ribs two or three and contained to one side in approximately 70% of patients, though it has been identified at the sternoclavicular and xiphisternal joints.

There have been discussionsÂ regarding the possibility that this disease process is inflammatory and may be part of a more comprehensive seronegative pathology.
