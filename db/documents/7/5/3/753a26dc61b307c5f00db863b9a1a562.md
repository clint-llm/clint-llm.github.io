Palatoglossus is the only tongue muscle derived from the fourth branchial arch. All the other muscles of the tongue derive from the occipital myotomes. This is the reason that all the other tongue muscles receive innervation from theÂ twelfth cranial nerve (hypoglossal nerve) except the palatoglossus muscle, which is innervated by the tenth cranial nerve (vagus nerve).
