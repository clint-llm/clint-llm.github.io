Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect is a rare congenital anomaly with poor prognostic outcomes. It is a serious anomaly affecting the development of pulmonary trunk and the membranous portion of the interventricular septum. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pulmonary atresia with interventricular septal defect and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect medical conditions and emergencies.
- Outline the evaluation of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect.
- Review the management options available for pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect.
