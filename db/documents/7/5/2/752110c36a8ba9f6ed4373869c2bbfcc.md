Researchers have identified a few pathogenic mechanisms for synucleins, but normal cellular function and mechanism remain unclear. Presynaptic nerve terminals function via the repeated release of neurotransmitters and, as such, require constant cycling of the SNARE complex. Experiments have shown that alpha-synuclein has a nonclassical chaperone role in the maintenance of presynaptic SNARE complex assembly. Alpha-synuclein can be found bound to SNARE protein synaptobrevin-2/vesicle-associated membrane protein 2. This interaction keeps the SNARE complex in an assembled state and prevents the presynaptic nerve terminal from being able to release neurotransmitters.

Alpha-synuclein undergoes several posttranslational changes, particularly in its carboxy-terminal tail portion: ubiquitination; sumoylation (stimulates protein solubility); glycation; glycosylation; nitration (inhibits the binding to lipid vesicles); proteolysis; phosphorylation (inhibiting its aggregation); oxidation; acetylation (increases its shape and helical folding, with aggregation resistance and greater affinity with membrane bonds). These new adaptations will lead to building new structures and different binding affinities.
