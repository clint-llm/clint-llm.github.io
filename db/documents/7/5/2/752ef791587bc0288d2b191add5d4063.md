Thrombosis of the superior mesenteric artery, whether in-situ or embolic, causes an abrupt cessation in the primary blood flow to the majority of the small bowel as well as (typically) Â the ascending colon. This disruption leads to malperfusion of the involved end organ leading to ischemia and, ultimately, infarction. The severity of the injury directly relates to the amount of small bowel affected. In general, the more proximal the occlusion, the more severe the injury. Other factors, including the duration of ischemia, hypotension, and the presence (or absence) of collateral circulation may have a direct impact on the severity of the insult.
