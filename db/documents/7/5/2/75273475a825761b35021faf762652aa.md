XLA is caused by mutations in the BTK gene which is present on the long arm of the X-chromosome. BTK is a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases which are signal transduction molecules. Nearly 544 mutations have been associated with the disease. These include nonsense, splice site mutations as well as deletions and insertions.

Forty percent of affected individuals have a positive family history while in 60% of the individuals the mutation is spontaneous. Thus individuals with a typical phenotype but negative family history should be suspected to have XLA and tested adequately.
