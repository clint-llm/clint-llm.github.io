The DTR is used to assess the integrity of the motor system and provides information on the condition of upper and lower motor neurons. A hypoactive or absent reflex will be noted if a patient has an injury or a disease involving a lower motor neuron (nerve roots or peripheral nerves). A hyperactive reflex will be present if the lesion or injury involves the upper motor neuron (brain, brainstem, or spinal cord). In severe chronic cases, usually associated with spasticity, clonus can be seen, which is the involuntary and rhythmic contraction of muscles caused by a lesion in the descending motor neurons.

Understanding the laterality of reflexes can help localize the lesions. For example, suppose all reflexes on the left side of the body are hyperactive, and those on the right side are normal. In that case, it can be inferred that there exists a lesion interrupting the corticospinal pathways somewhere above the level of the highest reflex that is hyperactive.

Deep tendon reflexes are a powerful tool to evaluate a pregnant patient's response to magnesium infusions. Magnesium sulfate is the primary medication used to prevent and manage eclamptic seizures, as it exerts its effects by depressing the central nervous system (CNS). One of the first signs of magnesium toxicity is new-onset loss of DTRs, which is a hard sign that magnesium infusion should be immediately stopped.
