The nervous system can exert excitatory control over muscle contraction or can have an inhibitory influence on reflex contractions and hyperreflexia.Â This control is achieved through the transfer of action potential from the nerve to the target muscle with the help of a neurotransmitter so that nerve impulse can be converted to appropriate muscle contraction of the skeletal, smooth, or cardiac muscle. All vital functions that need voluntary or involuntary contraction of skeletal, smooth, or cardiac muscles, such as circulation, respiration, digestion, urination, locomotion, etc., could be carried out efficiently due to intact NMJ and proper neuromuscular transmission.
