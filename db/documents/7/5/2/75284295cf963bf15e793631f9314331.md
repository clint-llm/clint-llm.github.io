Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent used as therapy for several types of cancer. It has a long list of both approved and off-label malignancies for which it is used as both a primary agent and in conjunction with other medications. Indicated cancers include breast, ovarian, bladder, lung, prostatic, melanoma, esophageal, Kaposi sarcoma, and other solid tumors. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of paclitaxel so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes in cancers where paclitaxel has benefit.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action for paclitaxel.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of paclitaxel.
- Summarize the malignancies for which paclitaxel is indicated, both approved and off-label.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who can benefit from chemotherapy with paclitaxel.
