All patients should have a pre-operative duplex ultrasound mapping of leg veins to identify the location of reflux, vein diameter, the velocity of reflux, and patency of vein. Reflux time greater than 500 milliseconds is considered abnormal. Ultrasound mapping can be used to reveal abnormal venous anatomy, the origin of venous varicosity, and perforating veins as well as to evaluate the deep venous system. This will help serve as a roadmap.
