Early lesions may show surface ulceration, epidermal hyperplasia, and a dense dermal infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Over time, chronic inflammatory cells and granulomatous inflammation replace the neutrophils, with variable caseation necrosis. Acid-fast bacilli are usually easy to find in early lesions but are rare once granulomas develop.
