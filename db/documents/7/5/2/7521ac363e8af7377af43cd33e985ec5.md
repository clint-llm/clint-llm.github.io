Since it is an invasive monitoring technique, the assessment of risk to benefit must take place in each patient. Contraindications for initial central venous cannulation include infection at the site of central venous insertion, coagulopathies that may lead to excessive bleeding, conditions that prevent correct Trendelenburg positioning, such as high intracranial pressure, or refusal to cooperate by the patient.

- Lack of skilled health care professional to place and maintain PAC (complications can happen during placement and malposition of catheter already placed)

- Patients with sensitivity to heparin

- Patients with latex allergy (use latex-free catheters if available )

- Tricuspid vegetation or mobile thrombus in the right heart (potential to embolize while placing PAC)

- Left bundle branch block (since a right bundle branch block during insertion of PAC can lead to complete heart block)
