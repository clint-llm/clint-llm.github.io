Any history of significant trauma to the head, especially with associated loss of consciousness, should elicit suspicion for cranial bone fractures. On physical examination, patients with temporal bone fractures may present with hemorrhagic or clear otorrhea, hemotympanum, vertigo, nystagmus, facial paralysis, conductive or sensorineural hearing loss, ear canal laceration, or Battleâ€™s sign (bruising over the mastoid process).
