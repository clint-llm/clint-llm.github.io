The diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) was first described in a kidney biopsy specimen byÂ William Thomas Councilman, the chief pathologist of Brigham Hospital in 1898. In a post mortem review of 42 cases, he described nonsuppurative interstitial lesions found predominantly in patients with streptococcal infection, which were later implicated in the immunopathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI). Over the years, AIN has been linked to a variety of infections, drugs, and systemic disorders.
