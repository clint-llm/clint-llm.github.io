Fluorescein is an organic compound used as a dye, particularly as a fluorescent agent in diagnostic procedures at various levels.

**Ophthalmology**

- Fluorescein has extensive use in routine ophthalmic tests. This usage ranges from applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, and contact lens fittings to angioscopy/angiography of retina and iris vasculature. In the first scenario, after an anesthetic and a fluorescein strip are applied to the eyes, a tonometer is placed on the cornea to determine the intraocular pressure of one eye at a time. Applanation tonometry utilizes fluorescein to produce semicircles that aid in the measurement of the dial reading. For improved detection of any breaks in the vasculature or associated retinal conditions, fluorescein angiography stains the blood vessels of the retina and iris to provide a detailed image of the posterior view of the eye. One study on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) relies on fluorescein angiography to evaluate treatment efficacy between two different drugs on peripheral retina vasculature. Unlike plain fundus photographs, fluorescein angiography also pinpointed vascular loops, blunting, dilatation, and capillary dropout.

- Additionally, fluorescein produces remarkable contrast to determine if any corneal abrasions, epithelial keratitis, herpes simplex keratitis, or corneal foreign bodies are present. If the epithelium of the cornea is not intact, aqueous humor leaks through and mixes with the fluorescein dye to reveal a corneal abrasion or other corneal abnormalities. In a study assessing dry eyes, fluorescein was useful in measuring the stability of the tear film. Despite any significant differences between using a standard strip or small volumes of liquid dye, fluorescein proved effective in augmenting any breaks in the tear film that occurs in dry eye disease.

**Bioimaging**

- The remarkable fluorescence of fluorescein permits considerable insight into the identification of non-diseased tissues, tumor-affected tissues, or histological markers. For example, fluorescein can serve as a contrast agent in surgical procedures for nonspecific identification of anatomic arrangements. Fluorescence of healthy tissue of the focused region differentiates it from nearby normal tissues and aids the surgeon in removing or repairing necessary tissues while also protecting vital structures. A surgeryÂ to repair hand anatomy may need fluorescein to highlight the nerves specific for fine motor skills or differentiate blood vessels of a particular section.

- Furthermore, in a microendoscopy study to find dysplasia in colorectal tissue, fluorescein was preferred to proflavine, especially due to its ability to highlight crypt structures with greater sensitivity, intensity, and uniformity. Identification of structures on a deeper, finer level expands the nonspecific functionality of fluorescein and eases the process of diagnostic procedures.

**Conjugate Species/Biomarker**

- Fluorescent microscopy allows for the identification of microorganisms or cellular components, such as proteins, in immunohistological staining. In the most common indirect method of immunohistochemistry, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses fluorescein to act as a fluorescent conjugated to secondary antibodies. Moreover, certain compounds commonly modify or combine with the original fluorescein structure to adjust the attachment of the fluorescent tag to specific macromolecules. The combination of water-soluble chitosan derivative with a fluorescent tag created glycol chitosan fluorescein-isothiocyanate (GC-FITC), which showed to be a sufficient agent used for bio-imaging when compared to its commercial equivalents. Even at a lower concentration, the biocompatibility of the molecule as well as the strong affinity to the cell surface, through a strong electrostatic interaction, offer efficient cell staining, namely, for the identification of lipid rafts.

- On a clinical level, a cardiology study exhibits the use of fluorescein as a fluorescent tag/biomarker in cardioscopy for the detection/monitoring of coronary artery disease (CAD). Fluorescein is injected into the circulatory system, and its fluorescence is observable throughout cardiomyocytes in terms of tissue fluid flow. Through molecular bioimaging, fluorescein plays a role in the status of patients with CAD experiencing angina pectoris or other cardiovascular issues or who have undergone treatment with stents.
