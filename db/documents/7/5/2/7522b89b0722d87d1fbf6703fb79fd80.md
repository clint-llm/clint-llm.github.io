Patients are usually asymptomatic, but some nonspecific pulmonary symptoms like dyspnea, chest pain, or dry cough have been reported by up to 40 to 60% of patients.

In Doege-Potter syndrome, patients may have symptoms of hypoglycemia since tumors produce IGF-II, which downregulates glucose production. Steroids may be considered in the treatment of IGF-2-induced hypoglycemia.

SFTPs may be associated with hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (Pierre-Marie Bamberg syndrome), which manifests clinically as finger-clubbing, bilateral joint pain, and stiffness due to synovial effusions. The pathomechanism for this process is not fully elucidated but is thought to be related to increased hyaluronic acid synthesis. It occurs in <5% of tumors, and the rheumatologic signs and symptoms usually resolve within 2Â to 5 months after the tumor is excised.

Malignant solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura are usually more symptomatic than benign SFTP. Larger-sized tumors are more likely to be symptomatic.
