Cranial CSF leaks can manifest either in the form of rhinorrhea or otorrhea. The leaks often present as rhinorrhea unless the tympanic membrane is defective and will present as otorrhea. The communication site may exist at the anterior skull base, including frontal and ethmoidal air cells, middle skull base, including sphenoid or mastoid air cells, and the posterior fossa, including the mastoid air cells and the middle ear. The most likely etiology underlying these abnormal defects is traumatic, out of which the most common mechanism isÂ motor vehicle accidents, especially in moderate to high-velocity trauma. Following motor vehicle accidents, blunt trauma to the head can lead to skull base fractures, presenting as CSF rhinorrhoea.

Other common causes include iatrogenic defects following neurosurgical procedures like opening the sphenoid sinus in trans-sphenoidal surgeries or opening the mastoid air cells in posterior fossa surgeries. A small proportion of cases are caused by non-traumatic etiologies, which may be associated with raised ICP like hydrocephalus or intracranial space-occupying lesion or normal ICP like congenital defects, focal atrophy, or post-infection bony erosions. Similarly, spinal CSF leaks may follow traumatic or iatrogenic communication between spinal subarachnoid space and the external environment.
