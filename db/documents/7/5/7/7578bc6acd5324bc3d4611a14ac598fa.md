**Inputs to the dentate nucleus.**Afferent proprioceptive information synapses with dentate nucleus neurons through the spinocerebellar tract via the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Premotor cortex and supplementary cortex neurons also synapse the dentate nucleus.

**Outputs to the thalamus.**Utilizing the dentatothalamic tract, the dentate nucleus sends output signals through the ipsilateral superior cerebral peduncle, then decussate to synapse the contralateral ventrolateral (VL) thalamic nucleus. VL neurons send fibers to the precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex; M1), premotor cortex, prefrontal gyri, posterior parietal areas, and the basal ganglia – specifically the striatum and the substantia nigra.

**Myoclonic triangle.**The dentate nucleus, along with the red nucleus and the inferior olivary nucleus (ION) of the medulla oblongata, comprises the myoclonic triangle (triangle of Guillain-Mollaret).****

**Cerebellar Purkinje cells.**Cerebellar Purkinje cells are GABAnergic neurons located in the cerebellar cortex synapse on deep cerebellar nuclei, such as the dentate nucleus, to inhibit deep cerebellar neurons.
