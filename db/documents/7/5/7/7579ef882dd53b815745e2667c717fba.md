The management of a patient with disorders of the neurohypophysis can be challenging in an intrahospital setting. In certain situations, complications can be avoided with early recognition of symptoms.Â The presentation due to sodium abnormalities can be varied but can progress to coma and death if untreated. The patient must be aware of any changes in urine volume or an increase in thirst sensation. The patient needs to recognize polyuria, increase thirst sensation, muscle weakness, twitching, and confusion. In the presence of any of those symptoms, immediate contact with the primary physician should be obtained for further assessment and evaluation.
