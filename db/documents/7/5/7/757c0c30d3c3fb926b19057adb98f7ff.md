The initial screening for HPS involves using a pulse oximeter to evaluate PaO2. An O2 saturation of less than 96% signifies PaO2 less than 70 mm Hg and is considered a positive screen.

In the case of a positive screen, the patient should undergo arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, which helps to determine PaO2 and A-aO2.

Contrast-enhanced echocardiography with agitated saline is the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary vascular dilatation. Normal saline is agitated to generate microbubbles > 10 micrometers in diameter. Normal saline is injected into a peripheral vein in the arm, and simultaneous transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is performed. Usually, microbubbles are trapped in the pulmonary circulation and absorbed by the alveoli. However, in the presence of pulmonary dilatation and AV shunts, microbubbles evade pulmonary capture and reach the left atria of the heart and can be seen via TTE in the left atrial chamber. The appearance of microbubbles in the left atria between the 4th and 6th cardiac cycle indicates pulmonary vasodilatation. If the microbubbles appear on the heart's left side before the 3rd cardiac cycle, it shows intracardiac shunting.

A transesophageal echocardiogram study****is superior to transthoracic echocardiography in diagnosing pulmonary dilation and intracardiac shunting. However, this test is invasive and riskier due to esophageal varices in many patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.

Radioactive lung perfusion scanning is another test to establish pulmonary vessel dilatation. However, it is not as sensitive as contrast-enhanced echocardiography. This test does not distinguish between intrapulmonary and intracardiac shunting. It may be useful in deciding if HPS is contributing to hypoxemia in patients with concomitant lung disease. Radiolabeled albumin aggregates measuring approximately 20 micrometers in diameter are infused into the peripheral vein. Normally, particles of this size are trapped in the pulmonary microvasculature, and scintigraphy reveals nearly complete uptake in the lungs. When there is the existence of notable intrapulmonary shunting, some fraction of the albumin passes through the pulmonary vasculature and into the systemic circulation. Scintigraphy can be used to reveal uptake in other organs in addition to the lung, which allows the calculation of the shunt fraction. Brain shunt fraction >6% is considered significant.

Pulmonary angiography can be used to diagnose and also distinguish between type I and type II HPS. However, it is a more expensive and invasive test, so it is not a preferred method of diagnosis. It is also less sensitive than contrast-enhanced echocardiography with agitated saline.

A chest X-ray may be normal or show increased bibasilar nodular opacities coinciding with increased pulmonary dilatation. It helps to exclude coexistent pulmonary pathology.

Computed tomography (CT) chest may show enlarged dilated vessels but is usually done to exclude pulmonary pathology.

Pulmonary function tests may show decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO).
