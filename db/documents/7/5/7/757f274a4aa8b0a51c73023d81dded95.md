Like other craniosynostoses, management is a team-based approach requiring multiple subspecialists such as pediatricians, neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, craniofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and dentists. Surgery is required to prevent complete coronal suture closure and protect brain development.

A detailed description of the surgical management of Apert syndrome can be found in the guidelines from the “Working Group on Craniosynostosis.

Long-term follow-up is essential to reduce the risk of developing complications related to craniosynostosis, such as strabismus, sleep apnea, and elevated intracranial pressure. Unfortunately, these issues are not completely resolved with surgical correction of the facial and cranial defects, as 54% of patients had vision loss in at least one eye related to amblyopia that developed after craniofacial surgery for Apert syndrome in one retrospective study from Australia. Fortunately, in this same study, the incidence of optic atrophy was low at 5%, presumably due to the widespread adoption of early craniofacial surgery for craniosynostosis syndromes.

While only available in laboratories at this point, chemical inhibitors of the FGFR signaling pathway restore normal FGFR signaling and rescue the associated skeletal defects.
