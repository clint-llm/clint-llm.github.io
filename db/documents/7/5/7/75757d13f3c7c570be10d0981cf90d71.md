Modern transfusion medicine prioritizes patient safety and focuses on reducing patient risks with the use of blood products. ABO discrepancies are common obstacles health care professionals encounter in clinical practice. ABO discrepancies describe scenarios that result in unexpected reactions in the ABO forward and reverse typing reactions. This makes the determination of the patient's blood group uncertain and can pose a threat to the patient's safety by transfusion of incompatible blood products. This activity describes the identification, interpretation, evaluation, and management of ABO discrepancies by the interprofessional team when it occurs.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the significance of ABO discrepancies.
- Review the interpretation of ABO discrepancies.
