The 2, main coronary arteries supplying the heart are the right and left coronary arteries. The left coronary artery (LCA) divides into left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCX) branches. LCA supplies blood to the left ventricle of the heart. The right coronary artery (RCA) divides into theÂ right posterior descending (PDA) and a (PL) posterolateral branch. RCA supplies blood to the ventricles, right atrium, and sinoatrial node. Coronary arteries are end-arteries supplying the myocardium and blockage can lead to serious adverse effects. Coronary artery disease occurs due to the buildup of plaque within the coronary arteries with subsequent narrowing and blockage reducing blood flow to the myocardium.
