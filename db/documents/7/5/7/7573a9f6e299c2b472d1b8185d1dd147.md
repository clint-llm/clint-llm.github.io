Currently, there is no cure for subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy. Treatment strategies depend on the mode of inheritance and include both correcting underlying metabolic disturbances and supportive care. Supportive care targets mainly acidosis, seizures, and dystonias. Acute exacerbations of acidosis can be treated with either sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate.
