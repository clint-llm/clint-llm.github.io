There have been numerous traumatic and atraumatic causes of peroneal nerve injury. Common causes of damage to the peroneal nerve include the following:

- Trauma or injury to the knee

- Knee dislocation

- Common peroneal nerve injury can occur in up to 40% of patients


- A direct impact, penetrating trauma, or laceration

- Injury predisposition as the nerve courses around the fibular head/neck


- Fracture of the fibula, especially at the proximal fibula

- Anatomic risk factors

- Common peroneal nerve entrapment can occur secondary to a fibrous band at the origin of the peroneus longus

- External compression sources

- Tight splint/cast
- Compression wrapping/bandage
- Habitual leg crossing
- Prolonged bed rest

- Can be seen in comatose patients or those intubated for prolonged periods


- Positioning during anesthesia and surgery

- Important to always pad bony prominences, including the area of the fibular head and neck at the lateral aspect of the knee

- Intraneural ganglion

- Peripheral nerve tumor

- Iatrogenic injury following surgery about the hip, knee, and ankle

The common peroneal nerve is most vulnerable to injury as it passes around the fibular neck. Therefore it is most susceptible to injury at the lateral aspect of the knee.

The overall incidence of peroneal nerve injury secondary to closed fractures is challenging to elucidate, given the lack of prospectively acquired data. Fractures of the tibia (including tibial plateau) and/or fibula are reportedly associated with approximately a 1 to 2% rate of peroneal nerve injury.

Significant trauma around the knee can also result in peroneal nerve injury due to the nerveâ€™s proximity to the knee joint itself as well as its superficial location; this can include a direct impact to the fibular neck, lacerations, and knee dislocations. Common peroneal nerve injuries are commonly encountered in athletes, especially football or soccer players, either in association with knee dislocation and ligamentous injury or in isolation.

Several systemic illnesses can cause compressive peroneal neuropathy and injury to the common peroneal nerve, including:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Inflammatory conditions

- Motor neuron diseases

- Anorexia nervosa (exceedingly thin states) due to loss of subcutaneous fat at this level causing compression of the nerve
