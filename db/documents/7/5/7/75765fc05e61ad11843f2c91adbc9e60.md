Both benign and malignant lesions can mimic intraductal papilloma. Inspissated material or debris within a dilated duct can mimic papilloma. Similarly, fat necrosis with cystic and solid areas can mimic an intracystic papillary lesion. The absence of intralesional color flow on ultrasound favors benignity. Phyllodes tumor is a benign but high-risk lesion that can similarly look like papilloma. Malignant nonpapillary tumors such as medullary carcinoma can present with central necrosis or ductal extension mimicking a papillary carcinoma. Ultimately, the diagnosis of intraductal papilloma will require tissue sampling for definitive diagnosis.
