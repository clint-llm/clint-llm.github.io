Fetal hand morphogenesis, which occurs between 6 and 14 weeks of gestation, can be described in three distinct phases of development, the shape from 6 to 10 weeks, the appearances of creases from 10 to 13 weeks, and creation of ridges from weeks 13 onward. In the first phase during weeks, 6 through 10, the entire external shape of the hand is accomplished in gestation. The first organization of the hand occurs with asymmetry of the hand primordium and development of the slot for the thumb as early as 6 weeks. During weeks 8 through 10, all of the fingers achieve the same spatial plane, and the thumb rotates. This is also when the configuration of the digital and interdigital pads are acquired progressively and become prominent. In the second phase of development, both types of pads begin to regress. The interdigital pads begin to regress around 11 weeks, and the digital pads follow during week 13 onward. Around 10 weeks, the thenar pattern area emerges due to the opposition of the thumb which creates the first appearance of the crease. In the next 2 weeks, the proximal palmar and distal palmar creases become more evident. The last crease to appear is the interphalangeal flexion crease. The appearances of ridges define the third phase. The scanning electron microscope can portray the formation of ridges beginning off the lateral part of the fingertips, which proceeds from a lateral to distal then more of a medial to a proximal position at the end of the phalanx.
