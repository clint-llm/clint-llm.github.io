The patency of the ductus is promoted by prostaglandin E2. If the ductus remains patent after birth it is associated with pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Â A PDA can result in blood flowing from the descending aorta across the patent ductus arteriosus into the pulmonary circulation ("left-to-right"). This results in pulmonary edema. The "steal" from the aorta during diastole requires increased cardiac output to compensate. Extremely premature infants have limited ability to increase stroke volume and thus use increased heart rate to increase cardiac output. Decreased blood flow to the lower body results in increased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis and renal failure.

The magnitude of the right to left shunt depends on many factors but the most important is the ratio of the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to the systemic vascular resistance (SVR). If the PVR is low and the SVR is high, the flow through the shunt to the lungs will be high. This will also result in more blood returning to the left atrium and left ventricle, which later results in left atrial and left ventricular hypertrophy.
