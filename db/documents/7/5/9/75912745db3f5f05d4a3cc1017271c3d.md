Patients who have undergone trauma to the maxillofacial region should first have a primary trauma survey performed, addressing airway, breathing, circulation, and disability. After life-threatening issues have been addressed, a thorough history and secondary physical examination may be performed.

It is essential first to determine the mechanism of trauma to the maxillofacial region. Higher energy impact traumas, as seen in motor vehicle accidents, are liable to produce more severe injuries and may be associated with multiple facial fractures. The direction of impact may be important to understand the underlying fracture pattern better. Lateral blows tend to cause an infracture on the impacted side and outfracture on the opposite side, while impact directed straight onto the nasal dorsum tends to cause splaying outfractures of the bilateral nasal bones.

Physical examination should include a thorough assessment of the entire head and neck region, including skin, eye, ear, intraoral, and intranasal examinations. A complete evaluation of the nasal dorsum and nasal cavity should be performed with the aid of a headlamp as well as a nasal speculum or rigid endoscope. The external nose should be closely evaluated for the presence of lacerations and exposed bone or cartilage. Any deviation of the bony nasal pyramid should be documented. A post-traumatically increased intercanthal distance suggests the presence of a nasoorbitoethmoid fracture.
