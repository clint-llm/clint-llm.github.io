Sterol analysis usually shows elevated levels of C4-methylated and C4-carboxy sterol intermediates due to the defect in the NAD[P]H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein gene. It is vital to detect any skeletal and visceral abnormalities early to provide appropriateÂ care. Radiologic examination such as x-ray, CT, MRI should be performed. Confirmatory diagnosis is possible with DNA sequence analysis to detect any mutation in the NSDHL gene. Skin biopsies can also be performed for dermatologic lesions.
