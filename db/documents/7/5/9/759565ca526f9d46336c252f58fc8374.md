PHH postoperative care is based on principles of an enhanced recovery program. The patients are mobilized early, resuming oral fluid intake in the immediate postoperative period, and appropriate analgesia. The soft diet will be commenced early if no anti-reflux procedure has been performed; otherwise, the diet will be gradually increased over the next two weeks.
