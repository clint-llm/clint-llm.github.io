High-Fidelity Simulation (HFS) is a misunderstood term. Too often, HFS is mistakenly used to refer to a particular simulation modality, namely, the full-body, high-complexity patient simulator. However, modality and fidelity are two distinct components of simulation design, and both impact the overall effectiveness of the activity.high-fidelity simulation is not used consistently throughout simulation literature. Yet, numerous published studies are attempting to measure its influence.

The Healthcare Simulation Dictionary recognizes both fidelity and modality as “potentially controversial” terms; acknowledgment on the part of simulation experts that there is a disparity in the usage of these terms in the literature (Joseph Lopreiato, MD personal communication, May 2020). Modality is the term used to refer to the type(s) of simulation equipment or methodology used in an SBLE, such as a task trainer, standardized or simulated patient (SP), full-body manikin, or screen-based simulation. Continuous advancements in technology explain some of the difficulty in clearly defining this term and the categories found within it.

Fidelity in simulation is a multi-dimensional concept corresponding to the degree of realism created through the selection of simulation equipment, setting, and scenario.Fidelity also refers to the degree of exactness achieved;
