Initial treatment for tendinosis, like other musculoskeletal disorders, is initially conservative. Rest, cryotherapy, and eccentric exercises with either a physical or occupational therapist should be prescribed initially. There is debate over the role of both oral and topical NSAIDs in the treatment of tendinopathy, with some studies even showing harm associated with their use. This issue is still being debated, and recommendations are unclear. Previously, steroid injections were a common form of treatment, but this is no longer first-line treatment. Short-term reduction in pain has been seen with steroid injections; however, long-term follow-up has linked steroid injections to worse clinical outcomes. Most patients with overuse tendinopathies fully recover within 3 to 6 months. For those patients that are refractory to conservative treatment, other options are available—many of the treatments used for refractory tendinosis target the associated neovascularization. High-volume guided injections, percutaneous needle tenotomy, sclerosis, and percutaneous needle scrapings theorized mechanisms of action involve disrupting these neovessels. Other treatments include glyceryl trinitrate patches, percutaneous ultrasonic tenotomy, and orthobiologics (platelet-rich plasma, stem cells). Last-line treatment includes percutaneous tendon release or surgical intervention.
