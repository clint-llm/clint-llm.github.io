Femoral shaft fractures are a common orthopedic injury occurring in high energy trauma or low energy trauma in the elderly. Femoral shaft fractures are frequently associated with other comorbidities necessitating a thorough trauma life support assessment and interdisciplinary care. Among the various treatment modalities, Intramedullary nailing is the gold standard resulting in excellent outcomes. The goal of fixation is early healing and long-term functional recovery. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of abdominal abscesses and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of femoral shaft fractures. 
- Describe the workup of femoral shaft fractures. 
- Outline the common complications of femoral shaft fracture treatment. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the functional outcome for patients with femoral shaft fractures.
