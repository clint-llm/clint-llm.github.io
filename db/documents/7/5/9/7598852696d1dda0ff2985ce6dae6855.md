Algaille syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder that has a varied presentation. Because the syndrome can be associated with veryÂ high mortality, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, pediatrician, gastroenterologist, ophthalmologist, cardiologist, urologist, and cardiac surgeon. Coordination between the team members will improve outcomes. Because of the bile duct atresia, most infants need a biliary drainage procedure or a liver transplant. The need to monitor these infants for complications cannot be overstated. [Level 5]
