Pharmacological treatment for cryptococcal infections depends on the site of infection and the severity of symptoms. Â Per the 2010 IDSA Guidelines, non-immunosuppressive patients suspected of having a pulmonary cryptococcal infection with mild-to-moderate symptoms can be treated with fluconazole at a dose of 400mg daily for 6-12 months. This is also the treatment recommendation for non-meningeal, non-pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients where CNS disease was ruled out. In non-immunocompromised patients, a lumbar puncture should be considered ruling out asymptomatic CNS involvement, but the guidelines state that an LP can be avoided in asymptomatic, immunocompetent patients with no CNS symptoms.

Management of CNS cryptococcosis and in immune-compromised hosts involves treatment targeting the fungal pathogen, reducing the intracranial pressure, and improvising the immune status of the patient. Antifungal therapy that targets Cryptococcus comprises induction, consolidation, and maintenance phase. Amphotericin B and flucytosine, for a minimum duration of 2 weeks are recommended antifungal therapies that are used for induction phase and fluconazole for a duration of eight weeks is the recommended drug for consolidation phase of the therapy.

Monitoring intracranial pressure and keeping it under check plays an important role in reducing the mortality associated with cryptococcal meningitis.

There has been a steep decline in the mortality rates associated with cryptococcal infections because of advancements in the anti-retroviral therapy. The prognostic predictors of the disease associated with poor outcomes include altered mental status, cerebrospinal fluid antigen titer greater than 1:1024 and cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count less than 20/microL.
