In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, favus was widely spread in southern Africa, Mediterranean regions, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Australia, and South America.

With the approval of griseofulvin in 1958, general improvement of living conditions, and anti-favus campaigns, favus caused by T. schoenleinii was almost eradicated in most nations like the USA and European countries.

Tinea capitis favosa occurs predominantly during childhood, mainly because of their lack of fungistatic long fatty acids in the sebum.
