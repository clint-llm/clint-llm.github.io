ONSMs arise from the arachnoid cap cells of the optic nerve sheath, and as such are on the inside of the dura. The tumor typically has a smooth lobulated contour. The optic nerve, which is usually circumferentially encased, gradually atrophies due to compression. The tumor may grow and extend into the chiasm through the optic foramen. Malignant transformation is rare.
