Psittacosis is a systemic disease that can cause an atypical pneumonia when it infects the lungs. Psittacosis is also known as avian chlamydiosis, ornithosis, and parrot fever. This disease is caused by the zoonotic bacterium Chlamydia psittaci, which is transmitted to humans primarily from birds. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of psittacosis pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of psittacosis pneumonia.
- Review the presentation of psittacosis pneumonia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for psittacosis pneumonia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with psittacosis pneumonia.
