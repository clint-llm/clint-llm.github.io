Interlaminar epidural injection refers to a procedure that involves the delivery of injectate to the epidural space by directing a needle between the laminae of two adjacent vertebrae. The goal of this interventional pain medicine procedure is the relief of radicular pain and is a therapeutic option in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine. Injectate typically is composed of a combination of anesthetics and steroids. The interlaminar approach allows for medication spread over a larger area than transforaminal epidural injection and can be advantageous in patients with multi-level spinal pathology. However, the intrinsic nature of the dorsal approach of interlaminar injection results in a limited ventral spread of injectate compared to transforaminal epidural injections, which can limit efficacy in a pathology-dependent manner.
