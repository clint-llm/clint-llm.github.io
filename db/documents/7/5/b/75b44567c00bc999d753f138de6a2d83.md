The basilar artery (BA) is formed over the surface of the pons by two vertebral arteries to supply the critical areas of the brain and brainstem. Anatomically, it can be subdivided into three arbitrary segments: proximal from the vertebral artery (VA) to anterior inferior cerebellar arteries (AICA), middle from AICA to the origin of superior cerebellar arteries (SCA), and finally, the distal segment from SCA to the terminal posterior cerebral arteries (PCA). Basilar artery infarct or occlusion (BAO) is caused by the obliteration of blood supply to the posterior circulation or vertebrobasilar system of arteries to the brain. This activity describes the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of basilar artery infarction and highlights the role of the healthcare team in immediately and accurately recognizing, evaluating, and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of basilar artery infarct as a medical and neurologic emergency.
- Review the evaluation of the basilar artery infarct.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for BAO and summarize key clinical trials showing evidence-based treatment options for ischemic stroke.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage BAO and improve outcomes appropriately.
