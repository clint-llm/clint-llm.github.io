Patient education is critical in managing vasomotor rhinitis. Patients with known environmental, non-immunologic, and irritant triggers should be reminded to avoid exposure to these offending agents. Avoidance of irritating stimuli is the mainstay of treatment. Avoidance measures and medical therapy are often enough to decrease most of the symptomatology and mucosal disease associated with nonallergic rhinitis. If stimuli are unavoidable, educating the patient on pretreating with topical nasal steroids or histamines can limit symptoms.
