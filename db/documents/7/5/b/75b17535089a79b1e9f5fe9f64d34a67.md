In 1961, Sarkay et al. examined scrapings from scales of an erythrasma lesion by microscopy. They described the presence of gram-positive rods which were found to be C. minutissimum. The bacteria have also been shown to cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients including cutaneous fistulas, granulomatous lesions, and subcutaneous abscesses. Corynebacterium is a commensal skin bacteria. Partly due to the potential for serious complications in immunocompromised hosts, C. minutissimum has had its genome sequenced by organizations within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.

Other environmental and host factors that increase the risk of erythrasma are living in a humid environment, excessive sweating, diabetes, poor hygiene, advanced age, coexisting skin disorders, and obesity.
