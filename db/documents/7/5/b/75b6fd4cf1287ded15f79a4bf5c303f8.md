The entire interprofessional healthcare team, e.g., clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nursing staff, and pharmacists, must work together to make sure that patients prescribed dapsone correctly take their medications, and most importantly, to discuss any serious drug side effects which the patient may encounter, e.g., rash, jaundice, etc. during their treatment. Open communication can preclude adverse events and make all team members aware of any concerns that may arise during monitoring. This interprofessional approach will drive optimal patient outcomes.
