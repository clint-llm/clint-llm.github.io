CO2 should not be combined with nitrous oxide sedation because N2 mixes with CO2 and reduces the solubility of CO2 in blood preventing its excretion.

CO2 arteriography should not be used above the diaphragm to avoid the possibility of causing a cerebral air embolism with associated stroke or death. There are two mechanisms by which cerebral air embolism occur:

- Through a known or unknown right to left cardiopulmonary shunt (cardiac septal defect, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation)

- From reflux within a carotid or vertebral artery to the brain

It is therefore prudent to have the patient in slight Trendelenburg position when possible.

In an animal model,

As with liquid contrast, CO2 raises pressure in intravascular beds and can exacerbate local vascular hypertension, such as in the pulmonary arteries. It is thus still important to be cautious of contrast over-administration in persons who have locoregional vascular hypertension, such as pulmonary artery hypertension, before overdistending the vascular bed.   Knowing a patient's risk for this can be determined by measuring local vascular pressure with a pressure gauge.  In patients who are believed to be susceptible to pressure exacerbation from contrast injection, the arteries (e.g. pulmonary arteries) should be examined regularly on fluoroscopy for dissipation of injected gas, which normally occurs within 30 to 45 seconds after contrast administration.
