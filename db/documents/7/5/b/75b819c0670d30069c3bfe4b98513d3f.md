Most patients with PCV Â present with a diminution of vision. Other symptoms at presentation include metamorphopsia, central scotoma, and floaters. Patients presenting within three months of onset have better visual acuity and clinically have signs of subretinal exudation or hemorrhage. The presence of lipid exudation or intraretinal cysts are signs of chronicity.

PCV is usually bilateral. In most cases, one eye's involvement would eventually develop a similar presentation in the other eye. Clinically, it is characterized by orange-red elevated lesions, which can be small, medium, or large. The larger polyps can be seen clinically on a routine fundus examination. The polypoidal lesions are most commonly located in the macular region. A study reported macular involvement in 69.5% of cases and peripapillary involvement in 4.5% of cases. Mid-peripheral polyps have also been reported.

Other clinical signs are serous or serosanguineous pigment epithelial detachments, subretinal hemorrhage, lipid exudation, and the affected area's neurosensory detachment.

**Clinical Classification of PCV**

- Quiescent: Presence of polyps without clinical signs of subretinal detachment or hemorrhage.

- Active: PCV is considered active if there is evidence of any of the following: vision loss of 5 or more letters, OCT/FFA/ICGA evidence of activity- subretinal or intraretinal fluid, pigment epithelial detachment, subretinal hemorrhage, or fluorescein leakage. Active lesions are further classified as:

- Exudative
- Hemorrhagic
- Mixed
