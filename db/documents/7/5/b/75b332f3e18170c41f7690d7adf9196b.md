The management of foreign bodies in the esophagus requires an interprofessional team with an interprofessional approach. Most patients will present to the emergency department, and the triage nurse has to be aware of the symptoms and signs of an esophageal foreign body. These patients need immediate admission. Emergency department nurses need to assist the clinical team by monitoring the patient for respiratory distress while the workup is going on and keeping the parents apprised of the child's status.

Once the diagnosis is made, consultation with the appropriate specialist is highly recommended. Most foreign bodies in the esophagus pass spontaneously, but about 3 to 10% may require some type of intervention. Some may require removal of the foreign item with endoscopy, and others may require surgery.

Prior to discharge, all clinicians and nurses as part of an interprofessional team have the onus to educate the patient and caregivers to keep small objects away from the reach of children. The parent should also be educated on the signs of an esophageal foreign body and when to seek medical care. Only through an interprofessional approach can the morbidity of this condition be lowered.

The outcomes for most patients with foreign bodies in the esophagus are excellent.
