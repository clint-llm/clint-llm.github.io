The Ogden classification is a modification of the original Watson-Jones classification and is commonly used to describe tibial tubercle avulsion fractures. The following types are subject to revision with an “A” signifying non-displaced fractures and “B” signifying displaced fractures:

- Type I - fracture through the secondary ossification center

- Type II - fracture extends to an area between secondary and primary ossification centers

- Type III - fracture crosses through the secondary and primary ossification centers

- Type IV - fracture through the proximal tibial physis

- Type V - extensor mechanism avulsion

Goals for treatment include the restoration of the articular surface and function of the extensor mechanism.

Clinicians can attempt closed reduction and immobilization for minimally displaced or extra-articular tibial tubercle avulsion fractures. After achieving satisfactory reduction, the leg should undergo immobilization with the knee in extension in a long leg cast or cylinder cast. The cast should include a mold above the patella to aid in the immobilization of the extensor mechanism.
