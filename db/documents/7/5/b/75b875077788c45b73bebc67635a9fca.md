Practitioners should highly suspect Fabry disease should in individuals presenting with the signs and symptoms mentioned above, along with the information gleaned from a thorough personal and family history and physical examination. A basic metabolic profile looking for electrolytes and renal profile, urine sediment for oval fat bodies, ECG, as well as an echocardiogram looking for conduction and structure abnormalities is helpful. Radiological investigations like chest x-ray, CT, CTA, MRI, MRA, and MR spectroscopy can be considered for neurological features. Specific diagnosis is made by documentation of low alpha-Gal A activity in leukocytes or plasma. If enzyme assay or genetic testing is not available, a biopsy of the skin or kidney can help establish the diagnosis. Glycolipid deposits will characterize the biopsy. Electron microscope examination of renal biopsy shows concentric layers of inclusions called myeloid or zebra bodies.
