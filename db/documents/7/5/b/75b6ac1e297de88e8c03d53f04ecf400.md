The pathophysiology of pityriasis rosea, and thus the herald patch, is poorly understood. As stated, there has been an association with HHV-6 and HHV-7 in the plasma and lesional skin of patients with pityriasis rosea, but other studies have revealed conflicting evidence. The inflammatory populations seen in lesions of pityriasis rosea and the herald patch are predominantly T cells with a lack of B cells and natural killer cells. Natural killer cells are cytotoxic to cells infected with viruses, and their presence would be suspected if it was solely due to a viral etiology. Interactions between the Langerhans cells and unknown components of the epidermis have been implicated in the pathophysiology, but this also is not understood.
