In the blood, chromium is primarily bound to transferrin and, to a lesser extent, albumin. 5% is unbound.

Some evaluation methods include serum, urine, stool, and hair assessment. It is important to note that, like many other essential trace elements, there is no reliable laboratory measurement for accurately determining the nutritional status of chromium. Urine excretion may reflect recent intake, while circulating serum chromium may not be in equilibrium with biologically active stores. Hair levels are thought to suggest past fluctuations in chromium intake.

Serum and urinary chromium concentrations may be the most accurate markers for evaluation due to evidence of increased levels with supplementation.
