Healthcare workers, including primary care physicians and nurse practitioners who prescribe denosumab, should monitor the patients. Pharmacists should assist in monitoring for side effects. The patient should get a baseline evaluation from the dentist before initiating treatment. The patient's electrolytes and renal function also require monitoring at regular intervals. The most severe complication of therapy is osteonecrosis of the jaw, and thus an oral exam is necessary at each visit. Periodic bone density evaluation every 1 to 2 years is the recommended interval for follow-up. Only through close monitoring of the patient can the morbidity of this agent be decreased.
