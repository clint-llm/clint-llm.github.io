Epidemiological data cites that both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have hereditary predilections.  ertain families, as well as identical twins, promote the importance of genetic factors (60% association in RA), but environmental factors certainly play a role.

In RA cases, HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1 are thought to be very important genetic background. This is particularly true among smokers with a positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP). HLA-B27 is the strongest genetic association of AS (first reported in 1973), but HLA-DRB1 has also been linked to this disease. HLA-B27 is not associated with RA.

The genetic predisposition and environmental factors will start an autoimmune reaction and antibodies will attack the synovium, soft tissue, causing inflammation and gradual destruction in the organs.
