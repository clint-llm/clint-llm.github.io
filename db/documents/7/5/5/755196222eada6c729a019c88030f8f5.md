A successful island pedicle advancement flap can have ideal cosmetic results and low patient morbidity. The involvement of an interdisciplinary team plays a crucial role in attaining these desired results. For example, after creating a primary defect where an island pedicle flap would be indicated for closure, an experienced plastic or Mohs surgeon may feel comfortable closing the defect themselves. However, in large or cosmetically sensitive defects, some surgeons may not feel adequately trained to close a defect in a way that would cause an area to function optimally or be aesthetically pleasing. In such scenarios, a prudent surgeon will seek the expertise of another surgeon to assist in the closure. Each surgeon knowing their limitations is vital to the safety of their patients and the overall outcomes of surgeries performed. For these reasons, access to a network of physicians to rely on for help is invaluable.

Ancillary staff is also essential in helping patients increase their chance of an optimal cosmetic outcome. Patients may be more able to care for their postoperative wounds when nurses and medical assistants are involved.

Although closing a defect with an island pedicle advancement flap depends almost entirely on the skills of an experienced surgeon, the time and effort provided by the physician, supporting staff, and the individualized nature of the patient's condition are all necessary for a successful overall outcome.
