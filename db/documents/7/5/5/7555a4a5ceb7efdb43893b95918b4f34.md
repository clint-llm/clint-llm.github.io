Malignant lesions will require a histology diagnosis with grading, analysis of biological markers, and cellular components. A complete staging of the disease guides the form of treatment to be instituted. Staging is achieved by a combination of clinical, radiological, and intra-operative findings. The TNM (tumor-nodes-metastases) is the best-accepted breast cancer staging system designed by the American joint Committee on Cancer.
