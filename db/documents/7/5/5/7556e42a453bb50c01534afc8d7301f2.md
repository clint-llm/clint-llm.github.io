Congenital scoliosis results from a congenital disability in vertebral formation and segmentation.

Structural
scoliosis results from a resulting body problem such as fused ribs, diaphragmatic hernia, or chest wall abnormalities.

Neuromuscular scoliosis is driven by neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy.

Syndromic scoliosis is associated with VACTERL (vertebral, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal abnormalities, and limb defects) and neurofibromatosis.
