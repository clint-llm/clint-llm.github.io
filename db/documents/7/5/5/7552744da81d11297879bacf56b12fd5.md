Trochanteric bursitis is a common cause of lateral hip pain that occurs when the hip bursa becomes inflamed. This can be due to repetitive microtraumas, such as may occur with running or exercise, tendinopathy of surrounding musculature, gross trauma, including falls from a height with direct compression to the bursa, or it can occur idiopathically. Diagnosis is clinical and based primarily on history and physical examination, although imaging, including plain film radiographs, is important to rule out other causes of hip pain. Treatment modalities are nearly exclusively nonoperative and include non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), physical therapy, and stretching, and in some cases, cortical steroid injections are provided for pain relief. Surgical excision of the trochanteric bursa is reserved for refractory patients that do not respond to nonoperative treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of trochanteric bursitis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of trochanteric bursitis.
- Review the history and physical of a patient with trochanteric bursitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for trochanteric bursitis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by trochanteric bursitis.
