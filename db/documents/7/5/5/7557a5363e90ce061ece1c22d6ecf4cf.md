A complication of HIV disease is its progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The physician should suspect it once opportunistic infections and/or low CD4 count are present in an individual who is HIV positive.

AIDS occurs when lymphocyte count falls below a level (less than 200 cells per microliters) and is characterized by one or more of the following:

- Tuberculosis (TB)

- Cytomegalovirus

- Candidiasis

- Cryptococcal meningitis

- Cryptosporidiosis

- Toxoplasmosis

- Kaposi sarcoma

- Lymphoma

- Neurological complications (AIDS dementia complex)

- Kidney disease
