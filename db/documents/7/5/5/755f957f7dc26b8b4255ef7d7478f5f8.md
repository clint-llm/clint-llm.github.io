The common indications for tracheostomy in children are as follows:

- Airway obstruction:

- Syndromes with airway anomalies e.g., Treacher Collins syndrome, Nager syndrome, Robin sequence, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
- Congenital anatomical abnormalities such as bilateral vocal cord paralysis, laryngomalacia, subglottic web
- Infectious disease compromising the airway e.g., epiglottis and laryngotracheobronchitis
- Benign pediatric airway tumors e.g., recurrent respiratory papillomatosis
- Extrinsic neck tumors causing airway compression e.g., cystic hygroma

- Unprotected airway, to prevent aspiration, e.g., laryngeal cleft, bulbar palsy

- To assist weaning off from ventilator

- To prevent laryngotracheal stenosis in long-term intubation

- Pulmonary toilet

- As access for ventilation in cases with difficult intubation such asÂ retropharyngeal abscess, post-tonsillectomy bleed, obstructive sleep apnea, foreign body in the trachea, facial burn, etc.
