Before performing a suboccipital release, the patient should have a neurologic and musculoskeletal exam of the neck and upper extremities. It is vital to ensure that the patient does not have contraindications such as the ones listed above.

Once it is determined that the patient does not have a contraindication for the procedure, have the patient lay supine, and the provider should sit on a stool at the head of the bed. The table should align so that the patient's head is around the level of the umbilicus of the provider. This allows for roughly a ninety-degree angle of the provider's arms to perform this technique with appropriate ergonomics.
