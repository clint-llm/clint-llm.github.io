**Overlapping Fifth Toe**

Most commonly referred to as overlapping or overriding fifth toe, crossover toe, or digiti quinti varus is a congenital deformity that results from soft tissue contractions involving the dorsal skin, metatarsophalangeal joint capsule, or extensor tendon complex of the fifth toe resulting in dorsiflexion, adduction, and an external rotation type deformity of the toe. Medial displacement of the extensor digitorum longus tendon line of pull or axis, over time, leads to worsening contraction and exacerbation of the deformity.

**Congenital Curly Toe**

A curly toe, underlapping toe, or underriding toe is a congenital deformity of the fifth toe characterized by a plantarflexion, varus, and external rotational deformity of the fifth or sometimes fourth toe interphalangeal joints. There has been debate about the underlying cause of a curly toe. One theory states that excessive pronation in the late midstance phase of gait results in flexor digitorum longus (FDL) subluxation, which alters the mechanical axis of the flexor tendons and results in the flexion and varus deformity seen in some children.

**Bunionette Deformity**

The bunionette deformity, also known as the tailor's bunion, includes lateral bony protrusion along the fifth metatarsal head.Â A large metatarsal head, lateral metatarsal bending, increased intermetatarsal angle (IMA), and the development of keratosis are the known factors for symptomatic bunions.
