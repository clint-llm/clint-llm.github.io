Serum sickness is a self-limited entity that will usually resolve upon discontinuation of the offending agent, with or without additional treatment. Thus, treatment is generally aimed at reducing symptom severity and removing the agent, or reducing exposure to it if complete removal is not possible (for example, potentially life-saving anti-thymocyte globulin in the treatment of aplastic anemia).
