Apart from the right upper quadrant abdominal pain that some patients experience, this is a benign condition and carries a good prognosis. Not all patients are symptomatic. Adenomyomatosis is often asymptomatic and detectedÂ incidentally. It is important to note that gallbladder malignancy can have a similar appearance to adenomyomatosis on imaging, and gallbladder carcinoma has a much worse prognosis than adenomyomatosis. Therefore, it is vital to ensure that the imaging diagnosis of adenomyomatosis is confident before dismissing this abnormality.
