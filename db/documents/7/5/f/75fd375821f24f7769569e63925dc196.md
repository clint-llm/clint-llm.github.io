While CNH is unlikely to resolve spontaneously, its progression tends to be limited to a single, well-circumscribed lesion measuring 4-6 mm in diameter. Leaving the lesion untreated does not put the patient at risk for additional long-term sequelae; however, because the lesions are uncomfortable, the patient may lose sleep and suffer chronic discomfort. Additionally, the lesions may become infected due to violation of the skin and potential exposure of the underlying cartilage. Complications may also arise from the treatment itself, particularly surgical procedures, which may heal poorly or fail to alleviate the problem. In the event that a surgical resection leaves a palpable cartilaginous edge or point, chronic pressure may lead to development of a de novo lesion.
