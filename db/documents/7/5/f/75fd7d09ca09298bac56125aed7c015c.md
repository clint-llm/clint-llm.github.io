- The use of immunosuppressants in chronic rejection does not adequately prevent it. High dosages may be used without an observable therapeutic response. This suggests that chronic rejection may involve many other mechanisms rather than only immunological pathways. Until the pathophysiology and immunopathogenesis of this rejection are fully understood, it is difficult to create novel therapeutic interventions to tackle this problem.

- The better the HLA matching between donor and recipient, the more successful the organ transplant will be and over a longer period.
