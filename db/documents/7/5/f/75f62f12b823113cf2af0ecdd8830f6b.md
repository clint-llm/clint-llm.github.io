Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine bind to melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and cause damage to the macular cones outside of the fovea.  The drugs inhibit RPE lysosome activity, reduce phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments causing an accumulation of outer receptor segments.  In response, pigment-containing RPE cells migrate into the outer nuclear and outer plexiform layers of the retina resulting in irreversible photoreceptor loss and RPE atrophy.
