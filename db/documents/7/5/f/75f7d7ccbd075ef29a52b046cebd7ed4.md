Holt-Oram syndrome also referred to as the heart-hand syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by upper limb abnormalities in association with congenital heart lesions. First described in 1960 by Holt and Oram, the syndrome was identified when thumb anomalies and atrial septal defects (ASD) were observed in family members across four generations. Since then, the identification of more cases and advances in technology has allowed for a greater understanding of the syndrome. However, there is still a significant proportion of individuals who are being born with the disorder in both industrialized and underdeveloped countries.
