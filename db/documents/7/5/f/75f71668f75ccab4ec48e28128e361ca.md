The infratemporal fossa encompasses a space that contains a wide variance of embryologic derivation. The mandible and the maxillary artery are formed from the first pharyngeal arch, also known as the mandibular arch. Other anterior bones of the face that participate in the boundaries of the infratemporal fossa, including the maxilla, temporal bone, and zygomatic bone, derive from the mesenchyme of neural crest cells and undergo membranous ossification.
