HIV-2 is a viral zoonosis that infects humans similarly to HIV-1. Phylogenetic studies suggest it emerged from sooty mangabey monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in Guinea-Bissau.

The pandemic spread of HIV-2 was catalyzed by colonial wars being fought in Guinea and across West Africa during the 1960sâ€“1970s.

The emergence of HIV-2 in Guinea Bissau, driven by these factors, led to rapid spread into neighboring countries and eventually to distant Portuguese colonies, including Cape Verde, Angola, Mozambique, India, and Brazil. Ultimately this also resulted in significant levels of HIV-2 transmission in Portugal, which currently maintains the highest prevalence of HIV-2 infection in Europe.
