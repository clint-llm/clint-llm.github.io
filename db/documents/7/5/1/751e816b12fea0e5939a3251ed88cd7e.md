The diagnosis in a newborn is usually apparent because of the grossly visible lesion in the back. Protruding membrane-covered sac-containing meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and nerve tissue are seen through a vertebral column defect. The clinical features of myelomeningocele depend on the:

- Level of involvement

- The presence of hydrocephalus

- Associated brain abnormalities

Newborns may remain asymptomatic up to 6 weeks of age. In the presence of hydrocephalus; Clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure (increase in head circumference, irritability, lethargy, and limited upward gaze) may be present.

Spina bifida can also be associated with Chiari-II malformation, characterized by downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and medulla. This malformation leads to obstruction of the CSF flow through the posterior fossa leading to hydrocephalus.
