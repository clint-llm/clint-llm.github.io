The lungs are paired, conical organs within the thoracic cavity that perform gaseous exchange. They are covered by the visceral and parietal layers of pleura, separated by the pleural space, which contains about 10-20 mL of fluid normally.

The trachea bifurcates into the right and left main bronchi, which enters the respective lung at the hilum. The right lung is usually divided into the upper, middle, and lower lobes by the major (oblique) and minor (horizontal) fissures. The left is divided into the upper and lower lobes by the major fissure. Each lobe is served by a second-order bronchus arising from the division of the mainstem bronchus. The lobes are divided into bronchopulmonary segments based on tertiary or segmental bronchi. The terminal bronchioles eventually divide into respiratory bronchioles where alveoli start to appear.

The lungs have dual blood supply â€“ oxygenated blood from bronchial circulation with 2 vessels to the left and one to the right, and deoxygenated blood via pulmonary circulation. Oxygenated blood is transported via four pulmonary veins into the right atrium. The right bronchial vein drains into the azygous vein, and the left into the hemi-azygous or the superior intercostal vein.

The unique anatomy of the lungs and their direct contact with the outside environment makes them vulnerable to a variety of pathologies.
