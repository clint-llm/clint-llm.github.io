Bleeding from diseases like von Willebrand disease or hemophilia is more generalized and occurs in the setting of an injury. In contrast, bleeding from HHT is more localized to the malformed blood vessels. Several diseases share similar clinical manifestations to HHT and need to be ruled out during the workup. Referral to a hematologist can prove very helpful.

**Limited Systemic Sclerosis**

Patients with limited systemic sclerosis, called CREST syndrome, develop calcinosis, Raynaud disease, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias. However, recurrent epistaxis is not a common feature of the syndrome. Specific autoantibodies may be positive in scleroderma, including anti-centromere antibody, anti-topoisomerase I (Scl-70), and anti-RNA polymerase III.

**Ataxia-Telangiectasia**

Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive condition that presents with cerebellar atrophy with progressive ataxia, cutaneous telangiectasias, immune defects, and increased risk for malignancies. Symptoms typically occur in the first or second decade of life. Key features of this condition include elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and decreased total IgG and IgA.

**Generalized Essential Telangiectasia**

Generalized essential telangiectasia is a rare condition with both inherited and sporadic cases reported. The telangiectasias first appear on the lower extremities and slowly spread to involve the entire body.

**Hereditary Benign Telangiectasia**

Hereditary benign telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant primary telangiectasia disorder with the development of telangiectasias on skin and lips during birth or childhood. Lesions are usually asymptomatic and do not have systemic involvement. Unlike in HHT, histology of hereditary benign telangiectasia demonstrates preserved skin and dilated vessels with thicker capillary walls, explaining the lack of hemorrhage.

**Rosacea**

Rosacea is a common skin disorder with recurrent facial flushing, erythema, telangiectasias, and inflammatory pustules on the face. Etiological factors for the development of the condition include genetics, environmental factors, neurovascular deregulation, and microorganisms.

**Telangiectasia Macularis Eruptiva Perstans**

Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans is a rare form of mastocytosis. The condition is seen more frequently in adults. Telangiectatic macules manifest as flat, reddish-brown lesions on the skin due to infiltration of mast cells into the upper dermis. Systemic involvement may involve the bone marrow, GI tract, liver, and lymph.

**Dermatomyositis**

Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder of the skin and muscles. Skin manifestations include heliotrope rash around the eyes, papules over digits, and periungual telangiectasias.

**Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**

Lupus erythematosus is a multi-organ autoimmune disease with varying clinical presentations. Cutaneous manifestations include a malar rash, oral and nasal ulcers, and periungual telangiectasias.
