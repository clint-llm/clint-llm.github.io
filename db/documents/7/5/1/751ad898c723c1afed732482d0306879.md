Depending on the type of electrophoresis and disease involved, specimen requirement and processing vary. Serum, plasma, whole blood, and hemolysate are the most commonly used biological specimens in diagnostic laboratory setups.

Nucleic acid or protein extracts from tissue or cellular lysates, products of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), products of sequencing experiments, etc., are the specimens used in research laboratories working on molecular biology, genomics, and proteomics.
