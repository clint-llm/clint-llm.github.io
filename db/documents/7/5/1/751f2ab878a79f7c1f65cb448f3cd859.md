Oral hemangiomas are benign tumors that develop in and around the oral cavity due to endothelial cell proliferation. The majority of oral hemangiomas will involute over time and do not require treatment. Medical and surgical therapy is available if these tumors persist into adulthood or interfere with speech, swallowing, or the airway. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of oral hemangiomas and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of oral hemangiomas.
- Describe the common physical exam findings associated with oral hemangiomas.
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with oral hemangiomas.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by oral hemangiomas.
