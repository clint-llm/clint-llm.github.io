Ketogenesis produces acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate molecules by breaking down fatty acids. These ketones are water-soluble lipid molecules made up of two R-groups attached to a carbonyl group (C = O). Because they are water-soluble, they do not require lipoproteins for transport. Of the three, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are acidic, having pKa values of 3.6 and 4.7, respectively.
