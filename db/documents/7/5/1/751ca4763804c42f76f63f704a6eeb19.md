The pathophysiology of actinic prurigo remains largely unclear. Still, evidence suggests the disease process is driven by a delayed type-IV hypersensitive response to ultraviolet A and B (UVA and UVB) radiation in genetically predisposed individuals. Both TH1 and TH2 lymphocytic processes have been implicated in the disease process. Multiple studies note the presence of eosinophils and mast cells in the dermal layers of involved tissue, which suggests a type-IVb (TH2)-driven response specifically. TH2 lymphocytes secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which promote IgE and IgG4 production by B cells. These immunoglobulins stimulate eosinophils and mast cells. Individuals with moderate to severe actinic prurigo have been found to have markedly elevated IgE levels, further supporting a type-IVb (TH2) hypersensitive reaction.
