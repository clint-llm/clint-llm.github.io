The management of cervicogenic headaches is interprofessional. There are several types of treatments, and healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, need to be aware of them. Physical therapy is considered the first line of treatment. Manipulative therapy and therapeutic exercise regimen are effective in treating a cervicogenic headache. Another option for treating a cervicogenic headache is interventional treatment, which will differ depending on the cause of the headache. There is some evidence that cervical epidural steroid injection has some benefits in treating pain in a cervicogenic headache. Steroids can work in this setting due to the theory that the pain continues sensitizing the cervical nerve roots and initiates a pain-producing loop involving nerve root and microvascular inflammation as well as mechanically-induced micro-injury. Unfortunately, cervicogenic headaches tend to recur and can significantly affect the quality of life. [Level 5] Thus, some patients may also benefit from simultaneous cognitive behavior therapy.
