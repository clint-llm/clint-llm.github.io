Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the abrupt and unexplained death of an infant less than 1-year old. Despite a thorough investigation (a careful review of clinical history, death scene investigation, and a complete autopsy), a cause for the patient's demise is not identified. SIDS is the leading cause of death in the United States in infants one to twelve months of age. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of SIDS.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of SIDS.
- Outline the common historical features associated with SIDS patients.
- Describe the differential diagnosis of the patient with SIDS.
