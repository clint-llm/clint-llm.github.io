Given the variable presentation, disease severity, and underlying etiology, the prognosis is also variable. Generally, patients with acute decompensated heart failure, sustained arrhythmias, and a left ventricle ejection fraction of less than 50%, or those requiring inotropes, vasopressors, or mechanical cardiac support, have adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Patients with fulminant myocarditis haveÂ a higher mortality rate and a lower transplant-free survival rate.
