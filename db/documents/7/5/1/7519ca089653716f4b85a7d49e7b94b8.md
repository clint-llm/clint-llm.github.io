Electrical alternans, although considered pathognomonic for pericardial effusion, is not a diagnostic factor for effusion and cardiac tamponade as other pathologies can result in this ECG finding. When present on an ECG, early evaluation of the patient’s vitals and overall presentation are imperative. If and when the patient is stable following resuscitation, further evaluation of the heart, including echocardiogram, is necessary to identify the underlying pathology and rule out tamponade. If tamponade physiology is present on imaging or hemodynamic instability from tachycardic rhythms is present further action needs to be taken with a focus on hemodynamic stability, then correction of the underlying pathophysiology.
