# Introduction

Historically, the model of trauma training was preceptors demonstrating techniques or lecturing before the development and implementation of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) as a basis for trauma education. [American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. Advanced Trauma Life Support student course manual, 10th ed. Chicago, IL: American College of Surgeons; 2018] In the nearly 40 years of ATLS, trauma education has transformed into training providers on evidence-based, standardized assessments and treatment protocols that incorporate practical skills alongside the lecture component.

# Function

Simulation provides an opportunity to educate medical providers on non-technical skills to reduce the risk of adverse events, therefore resulting in increased patient safety.

Specific to trauma, there is the opportunity to benefit from simulation courses or workshops (including ATLS) periodically to increase the accessibility of the training modality.

# Curriculum Development

Simulation curriculum development has, what seems like, infinite possibilities, but answering basic questions can assist in the creation of a successful curriculum. The first step is to identify the goal of the simulation, which will then dictate the simulation design. Two prevalent designs are skill-based (e.g., improvements in medical knowledge, communication, the time associated with skill completion, self-efficacy, etc.) and scenario-based (e.g., prioritizes reflection and the debriefing process as a learning approach).

As ATLS has expanded and cycled through nine different editions, the newest is the tenth edition, trauma simulation as a field has evolved. An exploratory PubMed search with the keywords ‘medical simulation AND trauma’ included publication dates in five-year increments beginning in 1990 and ending in 2019, resulted in 55, 102, 205, 422, 721, and 847 articles, respectively. Clearly, there were more medical simulation articles published as time proceeded. Simulations related to clinical care for trauma patients (i.e., trauma resuscitation,

In situ simulation, training taking place in the natural environment has served as an educational approach to practice in the working or clinical environment.

# Clinical Clerkships

Medical student involvement in simulation began as early as 1975 with the development of the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE),

Simulation-based training provides an opportunity for a variety of assessments to demonstrate outcomes based on the goals of the simulation. Researchers have focused on the clinical care component of simulation,

# Medical Decision Making and Leadership Development

While simulation has been a teaching method in medical education for several years, the assessment methods to measure medical decision making is a more recent area of study.

# Clinical Significance

Simulation as a means of impacting healthcare education has been supported by a robust body of literature as a training modality to significantly improve not only clinical,

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Inherently difficult to measure, since the ultimate endpoint is improved patient care which is an endpoint beyond the scope of most simulation-based medical education programs, much research focusses on technical skills, non-technical skills, and organizational outcomes. Accordingly, the surrogates to improved outcomes are measured precursors to the clinical care of a given patient. The evidence to support simulation-based training has been a discussion topic throughout, but there is additional research that supports outcomes for interprofessional training through the use of simulation.

Whether identified as teamwork or better understanding others’ professional role, simulation has demonstrated improved outcomes.

In a traumatic situation, all practitioners need to be able to perform at their highest level of competency under heavy duress, make rapids assessments, and formulate decisions as well as execute maneuvers that can save patient lives. Simulation teaches these skills plus the most important skill of communication among the professions involved. This paradigm applies to clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nursing staff, and pharmacists alike. All must learn the same level of execution and performance under stress within their particular sphere of clinical practice, so they can function effectively as an interprofessional team when the need arises, and achieve optimal patient outcomes through communicating changes in the patient as the need arises. This simulation activity assists the learner in improving interprofessional team communication skills. [Level V]
