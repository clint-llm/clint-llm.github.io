Patients who present with thrombophilia without other risk factors may suffer from protein C deficiency. Alternative causes of thrombophilia include other congenital coagulation abnormalities or a combination of protein C deficiency with other risk factors. The other congenital coagulation abnormalities include factor V Leiden mutation, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, and prothrombin G20210A mutation. Protein C deficiency may also be an acquired condition, rather than congenital, as a result of conditions including warfarin therapy, vitamin K deficiency, severe hepatic dysfunction, and bacterial infections in children.
