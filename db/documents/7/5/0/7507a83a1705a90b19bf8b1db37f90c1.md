Being diagnosed with lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma and undergoing treatment can have significant psychosocial impacts on patients and their families. These can bring dramatic changes in their physical, spiritual, emotional, and interpersonal dimensions. Every clinic visit should include screening and assessing the emotional and social concerns of patients and their families. They should also be well-informed of the types of treatment, such as combined modality therapy versus chemotherapy alone, pros and cons of each treatment, side effects, supportive measures, regular follow-up, and long-term management plan.

Furthermore, as some chemotherapeutic agents are known to affect fertility, patients should be counseled for optionsÂ such as sperm banking and egg freezing to preserve fertility. Regular follow-up with primary care physicians and oncologists is also important to monitor treatment response and treatment-related toxicities such as cardiotoxicity and pulmonary toxicity.
