The ankle joint is composed of the articulation of the tibia, fibula, and talus

The medial deltoid ligament is the strongest of the ankle ligaments and tends to be injured with eversion injuries.  Isolated deltoid ligament injuries are extremely rare.  The superficial deltoid complex limits talar abduction moments, while the deep deltoid complex limits external rotation of the talus on the distal tibia.

The distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligaments stabilize the distal tibia and fibula together in a physiologic manner.  Syndesmotic injuries are often referred to as “high ankle sprains” and are much less common than low grade ankle sprains. Given the amount of force required to injure this ligamentous complex, these injuries are distinctly uncommon in the general population and tend to occur primarily in competitive athletes. The most common mechanism of high ankle injuries is external rotation and/or ankle dorsiflexion
