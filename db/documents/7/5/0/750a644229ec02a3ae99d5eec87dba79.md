In cases of compartment syndrome seen in supracondylar, ulnar, or radius fractures,Â the volar compartment of the forearm is released. Volar compartment syndrome presents as pain with passive extension of the fingers and wrist, tenderness over the volar aspect of the forearm, flexion posture of the fingers, and weakness of finger and wrist flexion. Fasciotomy of the forearm is performed, and both the superficial and deep volar compartments must be released.
