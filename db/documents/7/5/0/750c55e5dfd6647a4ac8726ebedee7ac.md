Diarrheal illness caused by E. coli is commonly self-limited. However, an interprofessional team composed of the primary clinicians, infectious disease specialists, pharmacy, and the laboratory team can rapidly identify the etiology of illness and guide effective therapy in patients hospitalized with severe illness. Nurses are integral team members whose frequent assessments can quickly identify a change in clinical status. Nurses can also enhance communication between patients and the healthcare team, which leads to a better understanding, increased satisfaction, and better compliance with outpatient therapies.

Clinicians trained in travel medicine can identify candidates for chemoprophylaxis to travelerâ€™s diarrhea and help initiate appropriate therapy.
