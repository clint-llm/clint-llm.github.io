Hypodontia and oligodontia are typically grouped as one universal term, “hypodontia,” which is further defined based on its severity. Hypodontia is the most prevalent dentofacial malformation in humans.

Regarding deciduous dentition, the prevalence of hypodontia is less than 1% in White race populations compared to a much higher frequency in Japanese populations.

Hyperdontia (supernumerary teeth) remains a relatively common dentofacial anomaly. A study by Brooks et al. discovered supernumerary teeth present in 0.8% of primary dentitions and 2.1% of permanent dentitions.
