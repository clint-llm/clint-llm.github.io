In the acute phase, sepsis is the most common serious risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. Organ failure may occur, including pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems.

The most common long-term complications of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis are ocular (including blindness), cutaneous (pigmentary changes and scarring), and renal. Mucosal involvement with blisters and erosions can lead to strictures and scarring.
