The importance of medication compliance, laboratory tests or imaging work up compliance, and regular follow up at the appointments, especially primary care physician and hematology follow-up should be stressed. Time should be taken to clearly explain to the patient the risk versus benefits of the indicated treatment. The patient should be informed about the prognosis, and discussion about the code status and advance directives should take place at some point.
