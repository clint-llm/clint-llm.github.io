The adverse effects of castor oil are a common reason why it is not used often in conventional medicine. In a study comparing castor oil to sennosides, castor oil tended to causeÂ abdominal cramping, vomiting, bloating, and dizziness. Far fewer adverse effects were occurring with the use of other laxatives.

Few studies have also proposed that long-term use of a stimulant laxative may create a cathartic colon due to anatomic changes. Newer evidence is suggesting that a "cathartic colon" is not a real entity.
