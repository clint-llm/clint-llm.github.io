Galactokinase deficiency typically manifests in the neonatal period with either ocular changes or abnormal newborn screening. Early initiation of treatment is critical to prevent the formation of the cataract. The abnormal newborn screening requires careful interpretation carefully, and further workup should take place as early as possible.

Galactokinase deficiency is best managed byÂ an interprofessional team approach, including a neonatologist, geneticist, dieticians, ophthalmologist, and pediatric neurologist. Genetic counselors play a significant role in providing parental reproductive risk counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Galactokinase patients need medical, educational, psychosocial, and financial support services in their local communities.
