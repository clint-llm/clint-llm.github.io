Clinically, microphthalmia with cyst is classified into three types (Duke-Elder classification).

- Type 1 = Relatively normal eye with a clinically inapparent cyst

- Type 2 = Grossly deformed eye with an obvious cyst

- Type 3 = Large cyst which has pushed the globe backward, rendering it clinically invisible

Although the diagnosis of microphthalmia with cyst is mainly derived clinically, the role of orbital imaging canâ€™t be overemphasized. Standardized Ultrasonography (USG A + B-scan) is the preferred initial investigation modality as it is rapid, non-invasive, easily accessible, and helps in determining the status of the eye (whether anophthalmic or microphthalmic). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) aids in identifying associated neurological abnormalities and can be safely used in children. It may also detect communication channels between the globe and the cyst. Diffusion-weighted MRI and the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), in cases of rapidly enlarging cystic mass, may assist in differentiating it from a malignancy. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is better for delineating osseous structures and is especially useful for surgical planning in hypoplastic orbits. CT-based three-dimensional reconstruction is currently being utilized for presurgical planning. However, CT should be used cautiously in children due to a 0.1% risk of radiation malignancies.

Once the diagnosis is established by corroborating clinico-radiological and histopathological findings, the next step is to assess the visual potential of the eye. It has been shown that around 80% of cases of microphthalmia with corneal diameter 5mm or less have no perception of light.
