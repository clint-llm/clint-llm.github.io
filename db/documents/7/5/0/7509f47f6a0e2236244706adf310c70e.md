Two staging systems are used in CLL patients. The modified Rai-Sawitsky staging in the United States and the Binet staging in Europe.

**1. RAI Classification**

- Stage 0: Absolute lymphocytosis of > 10,000/mcL in peripheral blood and >/= 30% lymphocytes in bone marrow

- Stage I: Stage 0 plus lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes)

- Stage II: Stage 0 plus hepatomegaly or splenomegaly

- Stage III: Stage 0 plus anemia with hemoglobin < 11 g/dL (< 110 g/L) due to bone marrow infiltration of tumor cells.

- Stage IV: Stage 0 plus thrombocytopenia with platelet counts <100,000/mcL due to bone marrow infiltration of tumor cells.

**2. Binet Classification**

- **Stage A:**
- Absolute lymphocytosis of > 10,000/mcL in blood and ≥ 30% lymphocytes in bone marrow
- Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL ( ≥ 100 g/L)
- Platelets ≥100,000/mcL
- ≤ 2 involved sites*****

- **Stage B:**As for stage A, but 3–5 involved sites

- **Stage C :**As for stage A or B, but hemoglobin < 10 g/dL (< 100 g/L) or platelets < 100,000/mcL.

*****Sites considered: Cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes; liver; and spleen.
