Nephrocalcinosis most commonly presents as asymptomatic, chronic disease process discovered on radiographic imaging of abdomen. However, ordering radiographs might be feasible due to the evaluation of pain caused by coexisting nephrolithiasis. Nephrolithiasis can occur due to chronic hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. It can cause renal colic. Polyuria and polydipsia can occur with chronic hypercalcemia, medullary nephrocalcinosis, and in Bartter syndrome.

It can also present acutely with renal failure in instances such as tumor lysis syndrome and acute phosphate nephropathy.
