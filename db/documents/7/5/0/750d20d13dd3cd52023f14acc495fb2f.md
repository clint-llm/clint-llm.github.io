The back is a key topographical region of the body, with crucial importance for posture, locomotion, and upper and lower limb movements.

The spine, located in the midline, divides the body into unequal anterior and posterior segments. In the posterior segment, the body area between the neck and gluteal regions is defined as the back region. It lies with the neck superiorly and the pelvis inferiorly.

The back consists of skin and fascia overlying the spine, scapulae, muscle groups, nerves, vessels, and the presacral vertebrae. The primary movements of the back are flexion/extension, lateral bending, and rotation of the trunk. Some of the back muscles attach to the lateral and posterior processes of the vertebrae and help the spine maintain an upright posture, while others are involved in upper extremity movement.

The back muscles are divided into three layers deep, intermediate, and superficial. In some literature, these muscles are also termed extrinsic and intrinsic back muscles. This article examines the back muscles in the deep, intermediate, and superficial groups.
