Elevation of basophils may represent an underlying neoplasm such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or rarely solid tumors. More common causes include allergic reactions or chronic inflammation related to infections (including influenza and tuberculosis), inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disease. Drug-related causes and food ingestion also correlate with symptoms and degree of basophilia.
