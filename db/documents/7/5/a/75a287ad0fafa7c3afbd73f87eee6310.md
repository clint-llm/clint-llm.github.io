The traumatic or systemic event that led to ulnar nerve paralysis or intrinsic tightness should be thoroughly studied. Other disabling conditions of the hand include:

- High ulnar nerve injuries â€“ neuropathy

- Anterior interosseous nerve compressive neuropathy

- Parsonage-Turner syndrome

- Brachial plexus neuritis

- Carpal tunnel syndrome

- Pronator syndrome

- Forearm Volkmann contracture

- Dupuytren contracture

Patients with a complete ulnar nerve palsy diagnosis should not have any intrinsic motor function in muscles innervated by the ulnar nerve. In patients with a proven complete ulnar nerve injury, the presence of clinical findings related to incomplete palsy suggests the anomalous anastomoses (Martin-Gruber) between the anterior interosseous nerve and ulnar nerve, which is present in 15% of the population.
