Skin tags have found to be associated with

- Abnormal lipid profile

- Type 2 diabetes

- Cardiovascular disease

- Obesity

- Genetic factors

Frequent irritation of the skin has been implicated as a cause, chiefly in individuals who are obese. Experts believe that acrochordons are simply due to the normal aging process of the skin and the subsequent loss of elasticity. Hormonal imbalances may potentiate the development of skin tags (e.g., elevated levels of the female sex hormones, progesterone, and estrogen, elevated levels of human growth hormone in acromegaly). Both alpha tissue growth factor and epidermal growth factor (EGF) may also be risk or trigger factors for skin tags. While infective etiologies have not been reported to be a cause of acrochordons, there are anecdotal reports of some viruses that may be the cause. The human papillomavirus (HPV): in many studies conducted on various patients, researchers have observed a correlation between the infection and skin tags. Finally, there has also been an observed association with type 2 diabetes mellitus and skin tags in many studies.
