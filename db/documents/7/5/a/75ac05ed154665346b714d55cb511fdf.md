Dacryocystitis is characterized as an inflammatory state of the nasolacrimal sac. It is typically caused by an obstruction within the nasolacrimal duct and subsequent stagnation of tears in the lacrimal sac. When the lacrimal sac inflames and swells at the inferomedial canthus, dacryocystitis can be appreciated clinically. This activity reviews the cause, presentation and diagnosis of dacryocystitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of dacryocystitis.
- Describe the presentation of dacryocystitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for dacryocystitis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by dacryocystitis.
