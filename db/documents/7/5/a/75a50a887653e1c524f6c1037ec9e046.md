The most common indications for hysteroscopy are as follows:

- Suspicion of the intracavitary lesion

- Abnormal uterine bleeding

- Abnormal endometrial thickening

- Postmenopausal bleeding

- Infertility

- Mullerian congenital anomaly

- Removal of foreign bodies

Whenever possible, in-office hysteroscopy is preferred. Compared to surgical inpatient hysteroscopy, in-office hysteroscopy offers many potential benefits, including patient and physician convenience, avoidance of general anesthesia, higher patient satisfaction, faster recovery, and cost-effectiveness (ACOG Committee Opinion 800). Factors that challenge outpatient hysteroscopy feasibility include large intrauterine pathology, patient anxiety, lack of appropriate treatment setting and/or personnel, and physician skill and expertise.
