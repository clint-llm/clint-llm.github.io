The diameter of the pelvic ring is a surgical consideration that must be considered when planning childbirth.

Following pelvic trauma, reduction and fixation of pelvic fractures may be necessary. Depending on the type and severity of the trauma, plus the co-existence of any visceral injuries, a range of approaches and techniques can be used. In general, anterior and posterior approaches can be taken. However, in extremis, it may be most appropriate to undertake a complete trauma laparotomy to fully assess and treat the viscera and bony structures following trauma.

The anterior approach can be open or percutaneous. An open approach can be performed via a Pfannenstiel incision and allows access to the urinary bladder in case of urological injury in trauma requiring operative management.
