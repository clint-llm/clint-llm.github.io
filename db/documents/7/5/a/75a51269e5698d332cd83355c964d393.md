DNA replication is facilitated by DNA polymerase. This enzyme only has the ability to synthesize DNA in the 5' to 3' direction. DNA replication begins with an RNA primer, which is synthesized by primase. The RNA primer allows the DNA to locate the area of the chromosome where replication will begin. The RNA primer anneals to the template DNA to provide a free 3'-OH group where new nucleotides are added. During the synthesis of the leading strand, which runs from the 5' to 3' direction, only one primer is needed for synthesis at this location to be continuous.Â This is due to the addition of new nucleotides in the direction of the replication fork.

Telomere replication and maintenance presents numerous challenges. Repetitive tandem repeats of DNA predisposes DNA polymerase slippage during DNA replication. Frequent slippage of the enzyme may cause insertion or deletion of nucleotide bases as well as strand mispairing. The next challenge is the G-rich structure of the telomere. A higher number of guanine nucleotides can cause G-quadruplexes to form. Tethered G-rich tetrads are highly stable due to their increased amount of hydrogen bonds. The G-quadruplexes, which require specific helicases for proper disassembly, may induce replication fork stalling if the specialized helicase is unable to function.
