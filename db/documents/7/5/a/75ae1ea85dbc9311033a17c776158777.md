One of the primary concerns in doing research is the identification and formulation of the research problem (i.e., research question).

The second area of concern for research studies is selecting the correct research study to perform.  Many times descriptive and qualitative research must first take place to produce a robust, significant, and feasible research hypothesis for later quantitative research methods.
