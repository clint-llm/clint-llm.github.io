18-F-FDG PET scans have special requirements as follows:

- Fasting for 4 to 6 hours before the exam

- No exercise for 24 hours

- The patient should be well hydrated before the fasting period.

- A high-fat, low-carb diet should be initiated at least 24 hours optimally 48 to 72 hours before an FDG PET scan for any cardiac site infection.

- Special instructions should be given to people with diabetes to minimize peaks in blood sugars just before injection to decrease any competition of nonradioactive sugar with the FDG.

- Peaks in blood sugars in the time frame before injection will cause a peak in endogenous insulin, shifting glucose away from the target in question and into muscles.

- Patients with a history of diabetes should also have their medication regimen reviewed and adjusted to avoid peaks in exogeneous rapid or ultrarapid insulin. Usually, long-acting insulin should not significantly affect FDG uptake.

- People with diabetes should also be preferably scheduled in a morning slot.

Regarding labeled leukocytes, it is recommended that the radiolabeled white blood cells be prepared as follows:

- Collection of heparinized whole blood: The nuclear medicine technologist will obtain a labeled heparinized syringe.  Subsequently, the technologist will locate and appropriately identify the patient according to institutional approved policies.  The technologist will also consult the nursing service or a physician in the identification process and obtain a second signature on the radiolabeled blood product administration record. 50 ml (30 to 80 ml) of whole blood will be collected following proper patient identification. A smaller amount (e.g., 30 to 40 cc) may be drawn in neonates with anemia after consultation with the referring pediatrician. The technologist will immediately identify the syringe with the patient's name, registration number, and date before leaving the patient or per institutional policy. Two staff members witnessing the process and signing the radiolabeled blood product administration record are recommended. The blood sample label must correspond with the identifying information on the prescription and the radiolabeled blood product administration record. Blood samples should not be accepted if there is any doubt regarding proper patient-sample identification. Any discrepancy in the patient-sample identification information should necessitate the provision of a freshly drawn, properly labeled blood sample. Upon completion, the technologist should immediately deliver the patient's blood sample and the radiolabeled blood product administration record to the nuclear pharmacy.

- Leukocyte isolation and radiolabeling: The nuclear pharmacist/technologist will then isolate and radiolabel the leukocytes by standard procedures utilizing a laminar flow hood, aseptic technique, and sterile containers/reagents.  All patient samples should be labeled appropriately at all stages of preparation regarding content, patient name, and hospital registration number.

For 67-gallium-citrate scans, it is recommended to:

- Avoid blood transfusions or gadolinium-enhanced MRI scanning within 24 hours.

- Avoid recent iron transfusions.
