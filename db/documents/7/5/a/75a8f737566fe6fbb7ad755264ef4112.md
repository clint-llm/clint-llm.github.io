Patients with diaphyseal forearm fractures typically complain of pain at the site of injury. An examination should begin with a visual inspection of the skin and soft tissue paying close attention to visible bony deformities, skin lacerations, muscle contusions, tendon damage and neurovascular deficits. It is essential to identify wounds overlying fracture sites (i.e., open fracture), which necessitates immediate surgical intervention. Gentle palpation should be performed to identify deformities and focal tenderness. Stability of the proximal and distal joints should be assessed to identify concomitant injuries. A fall on an outstretched hand should raise suspicion for a wrist injury, and particular attention should be paid to the stability of the DRUJ. Avoid probing open wounds. High mechanism crush injuries merit a detailed neurovascular exam with repeat serial exams looking for signs of acute compartment syndrome. Inquire about weakness, numbness, paresthesias, and radiating pain. Although nerve injury is less common, examination of the median and radial nerve distribution is essential in identifying nerve damage. Ulnar nerve injury is rare.
