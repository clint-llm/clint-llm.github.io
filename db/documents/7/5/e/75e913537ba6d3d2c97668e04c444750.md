The disease course of JIA is highly unpredictable: in some patients is observed a self-limiting disease while in others, there is an unremitting disease with a high risk of joint destruction.

The JIA has the general pattern of inflammatory joint disease (synovitis, joint effusion, soft tissue swelling, osteopenia, bone edema, and erosions) with some additional elements related to developmental age, such as epiphyseal growth disturbances, premature physeal fusion, and limb length inequality.

The thorough history taking, including the age of onset, the affected joints, the duration of arthritis, the associated symptoms or diseases, and physical and MSK examinations are essential for diagnosis and classification of JIA.

A diagnosis of JIA is considered in any children younger than 16 years with arthritis for at least six weeks and exclusion of other causes of chronic arthritis.
