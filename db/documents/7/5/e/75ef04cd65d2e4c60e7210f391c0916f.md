Personnel required for the transfer of a rotational flap include a surgeon and an assistant. The latter may be a nurse or a surgical tech; for larger reconstructions, having both available is helpful. Larger, more complicated reconstructions may also require sedation or general anesthesia, which would require the participation of an anesthesia provider as well.
