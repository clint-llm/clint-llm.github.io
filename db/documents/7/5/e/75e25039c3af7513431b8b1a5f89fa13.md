One-year survival for infants with CCHDs has improved over time; however, mortality remains high. About 75% of babies born with a CCHD are expected to survive to 1 year of age. About 69% of babies born with critical CHDs are expected to survive to 18 years of age. Children with CCHD are at an increased risk for developmental delay and disability, heart rhythm disorders, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest or stroke.
