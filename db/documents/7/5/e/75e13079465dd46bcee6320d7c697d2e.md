The use of myocardial perfusion imaging depends on the clinical context and suspicion of myocardial mal-perfusion or to assess response after an intervention. Of course, imaging itself does not substitute for one's clinical suspicion for myocardial ischemia. Some indications for myocardial perfusion imaging include

- Evaluation of possible coronary artery disease for non-cardiac perioperative risk assessment (depending on surgical risk and medical comorbidities)

- Detection of coronary artery disease (depending on clinical evidence, there are different indications, e.g., troponin elevation without history concerning for angina)

- New diagnosis of heart failure with reduced left ventricular systolic function without an ischemic equivalent and no plan for coronary angiography

- Ventricular tachycardia with a high risk of coronary artery disease

- Syncope with intermediate to high risk of coronary artery disease

- Prior non-invasive evaluation with indeterminate results where obstructive CAD remains a concern

- New or worsening symptoms of angina in a patient with known CAD

-  Risk assessment in post-revascularization for ischemic equivalent symptoms of chest pain, incomplete revascularization in an asymptomatic individual, or 5 or more years after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

- Assessment of myocardial viability to determine if a patient is a candidate for revascularization
