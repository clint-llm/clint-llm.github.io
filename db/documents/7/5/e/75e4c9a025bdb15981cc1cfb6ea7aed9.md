- HS is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder with lesions ranging from deep-seated, painful nodules, to abscesses with sinus tract formation, to dense fibronodular scarring.

- HS begins with obstruction of hair follicles, followed by rupture and subsequent inflammatory reaction. Infection does not cause HS. It is not contagious and is not the result ofÂ poor hygiene.

- The development of HS appears to have both hereditary and environmental influences. The strongest associated external influences are obesity and smoking.

- Treatment options include medications (topical and oral antibiotics, intralesional and oral steroids, hormone therapy, and immune modulators) and surgery ranging from lesion de-roofing to wide excision.

- HS can cause significant psychosocial distress because of pain, drainage, odor, and location of lesions.

- The best prognosis involves early recognition and aggressive treatment at the early stages of the disease. Treatment includes psychosocial support.
