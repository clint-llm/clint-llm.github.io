The majority of the patients receive non-operative management unless an acute neurological deficit, a cervical instability, or a risk of chronic neurologic problems is present, where the recommendation is for operative management.

**Non-Operative Management**

Overall, treatment is conservative and symptomÂ driven. For patients with a 1 or 2 level fusions below C3, monitoring and conservative management are sufficient. They may play contact sports such as hockey and rugby with proper education.

Patients who are at high risk for spinal deformity should undergo activity modification. Those with a fusion above C3, especially to the occiput, should avoid contact sports and are more likely to be symptomatic and prone to the risk of spinal injury. This situation also true for those patients with long fusions of the cervical spine.

It is also important to focus on the poly-syndromic presentation of patients. For younger patients, pediatricians play a crucial role in coordinating care between various specialists for cardiac, renal, or gastrointestinal congenital abnormalities. This interdisciplinary care becomes even more vital if patients are candidates for operative care.

**Operative Management**

Patients with persistent neurological pain, myelopathy, new-onset muscle group weakness, and documented spinal instability are operative candidates.

Otolaryngological evaluation and treatment may be necessary for those with hearing impairment for placing cochlear implants and providing hearing devices where necessary.
