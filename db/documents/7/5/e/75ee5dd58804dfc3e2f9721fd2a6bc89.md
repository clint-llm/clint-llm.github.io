Patients with nPHPT should be taught in simple language the autonomous nature of the parathyroids in nPHPT and the implications of a raised PTH. When surgical treatment is suggested, all options should be discussed with explanationsÂ using anatomy using models, video lessons of the actual surgery, possible postoperative complications, recovery periods, do's and don'ts, and a simplified but comprehensive explanation of the technology used.

Patients with nPHPT choosing medical management should receive education on the medications used, dosage, administration instructions, warning symptoms of reactions or side effects, duration of therapy, frequency of follow-up, and tests required. The health literacy of the patients should be taken into account in formulating patient education in all instances.
