**Local Recurrence**

Local recurrences can occur in all phyllodes tumors, at an overall rate of 21%, with ranges of 10% to 17%, 14% to 25%, and 23% to 30% for benign, borderline malignant, and phyllodes tumors, respectively. Local recurrences generally develop within 2 to 3 years.

**Distant Metastases**

Distant metastases are almost exclusively a feature of malignant phyllodes tumors. The lungs (66%), the bones (28%), and the brain (9%) are the most common sites of spread.
