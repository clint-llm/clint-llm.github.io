The most common cause of left ventricular rupture is post-AMI. Risk factors associated with left ventricular free wall rupture are no prior history of angina or myocardial infarction, ST elevation in the initial EKG, peak CK-MB above 150 IU/L, female sex, age more than 70 years, anterior location, transmural infarction, and first infarction.

Iatrogenic causes include penetrating or blunt trauma from diagnostic catheterization, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (especially transapical approach), placement of temporary or permanent pacing catheters, balloon valvuloplasty, cardiac surgeries such as mitral valve replacement, and pericardiocentesis.
