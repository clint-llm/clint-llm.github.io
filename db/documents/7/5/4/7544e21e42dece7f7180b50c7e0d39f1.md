The three primary roles of the spinal cord are to send motor commands from the brain to the body, send sensory information from the body to the brain, and coordinate reflexes.

The spinal cord is the conduit between the brain and the rest of the body, sending motor commands from the motor cortex to the muscles and sensory information from the afferent fibers to the sensory cortex. In certain instances, the spinal cord can act without signals from the brain, as it can independently coordinate reflexes using reflex arcs. Reflex arcs allow the body to respond to sensory information without waiting for input from the brain. The reflex arc starts with a signal from a sensory receptor, which is carried to the spinal cord via a sensory nerve fiber thatÂ synapses on an interneuron and is carried over to the motor neuron, which stimulates an effector muscle or organ.

The spinal cord also contains central pattern generators, interneurons that form the neural circuits that control rhythmic movements. Although the existence of central pattern generators in humans is controversial, the lumbar spinal cord produces rhythmic muscle activation without volitional motor control or step-specific sensory feedback, suggesting their role in human movement.
