Hepatic granulomas are common as the liver is very rich in reticuloendothelial cells which are found in about 2% to 10% of liver biopsies. Unfortunately, they may be the result of a nonspecific reaction to numerous noxious stimuli and pose difficulty in providing a diagnostic yield. Around 10% to 36% of hepatic granulomas may be found to be idiopathic after an extensive evaluation. Systemic sarcoidosis is associated with hepatosplenic involvement in about 50% to 70% of cases. Granulomas in PBC are present in 25% to 50% of patients.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) can also cause hepatic granulomas with 25% in pulmonary TB and up to 90% in miliary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis and sarcoidosis are the most common causes and account for about 50% to 65% of cases of granulomatous hepatitis. Histoplasmosis associated granulomatous hepatitis is commonly found in endemic areas of the midwestern and central parts of the country, such as the Ohio River Valley, accounting for about 12% of cases in Ohio. Coccidioidomycosis is common in the southwestern parts of the US.
