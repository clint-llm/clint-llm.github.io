**Common Mistakes**

**Under-fogging the patient:**In this situation, the examiner puts in plus spherical powers (or reduced minus spherical powers) at a level that is not sufficient to reduce the visual acuity or keep accommodation in check by bringing the conoid of Sturm forward into the hypothetical vitreous space in front of the retina. The patient, therefore, continues to accommodate to bring the conoid of Sturm closer to the retina behind it.

**Over-fogging the patient:**in this case, the examiner puts in too much plus spherical powers (or reduces too much minus spherical powers), thereby pushing the conoid of Sturm too far in front of the retina into the hypothetical vitreous space with a resulting consequence of unnecessarily prolonging the defogging process.

Allowing too much time between removal and insertion of lenses. This commonly happens when using loose lenses with the trial frame. Removing the fogging lens to replace it with another one should be done as quickly as possible without causing the patient any discomfort. ThisÂ is achievable by having the replacement lens in hand while removing the fogging lens.
