Ipecac has a low risk of serious toxicity. "Considering that over 3 million patients received therapeutic doses of ipecac during the 14 years of 1983 through 1996, ipecac appears to have a high margin of safety. The potential complications of the therapeutic use of ipecac are well-documented, but serious sequelae rarely occur. An important concern is that the use of ipecac can delay the administration of activated charcoal by one to two hours." (p. 5, 2013 AACT position statement, above.)

Ipecac has very little accepted medical use in toxicology. If administered in the first few minutes after oral ingestion of a non-corrosive, nonvolatile substance, which, if absorbed and metabolized, may cause harm, ipecac may remove an uncertain amount of the ingested substance by causing the patient to vomit it up. The amount removed is very vague.
