There are many causes of diarrhea and the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses and pharmacists. Most cases of diarrhea can be prevented by maintaining good personal hygiene and handwashing. In addition, the key is to hydrate the patients. Most viral cases do not require specific treatment but bacterial causes may require antibiotics.

The outcomes for patients who are well hydrated are excellent but patients at extremes of age may not tolerate any degree of dehydration.
