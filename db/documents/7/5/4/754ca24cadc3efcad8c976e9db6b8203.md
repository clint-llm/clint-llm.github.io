The importance of childhood immunizations and boosters must be stressed. In developing and underdeveloped countries midwives and birth attendants should be given training in aseptic birth procedures. The basics of first aid and wound care should be taught to all. The early recognition of signs and symptoms of localized tetanus and timely seeking medical care is very essential. Healthcare workers, including nurses and pharmacists, must emphasize the importance of immunization. The tetanus vaccination has been considered as a routine vaccine in addition to pneumococci and influenza vaccines among older adults. Protection against tetanus by vaccines is essential because there is no natural immunity against tetanus. The tetanospasmin toxin is very lethal and will cause death before initiating an immune response. After recovery from an infection, patients must receive full immunity. In addition, post-exposure prophylaxis can also be provided through tetanus toxoid with or without tetanus immunoglobulin intravenous or intramuscular, depending on the wound.
