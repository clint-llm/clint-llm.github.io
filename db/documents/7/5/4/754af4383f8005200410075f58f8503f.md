Esterases extensively metabolize Netarsudil in the eye, and thus, the systemic concentration of the drug is very low. Although systemic absorption of netarsudil upon ocular installation is relatively low, no clinical trials have been conducted on the effects of netarsudil on pregnant women. Given that netarsudil is highly protein-bound in human plasma, this leads to low plasma concentrations; hence netarsudil is unlikely to cause any systemic pharmacological effects following topical application. Only preclinical studies have been done to determine the in-utero effects of netarsudil. In preclinical studies, researchers found embryofoetal lethality and abortions at doses greater than 126 times recommended human ophthalmic dose.

In another preclinical study performed on rabbits, lethal embryopathy resulted from daily intravenous doses of netarsudil at 5 mg/kg/day, which is 1480 times greater than the recommended human ophthalmic dose. Other anomalies include gastroschisis, absent lung lobe, and umbilical herniation at 1330 times the recommended human dose. Thus netarsudil has a very high therapeutic index. In patients below the age of 18, safety and efficacy have yet to be established. Given the low systemic absorption of netarsudil after ocular installation, it is assumed to have no side effects on the breastfeeding infant. However, it is suggested to exercise caution during breastfeeding, given that this subject warrants further investigation.
