# Continuing Education Activity

Orthostatic proteinuria, also known as postural proteinuria, is a condition where an abnormally large amount of protein is excreted in the urine when the patient is in an upright position and normal protein excretion in the supine position. In this activity, the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, histophysiology, history and physical, treatment/management, differential diagnosis, ongoing trials, prognosis, complications, consultations, and patient education will be discussed in greater detail. This activity also highlights the role of interprofessional team strategies in improving patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of orthostatic proteinuria.
- Review the necessary steps to take in the evaluation of orthostatic proteinuria.
- Describe the management strategies for orthostatic proteinuria.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Orthostatic proteinuria, also known as postural proteinuria, is a condition where an abnormally large amount of protein is excreted in the urine when the patient is in an upright position and normal protein excretion in the supine position.

Proposed mechanisms include some possibilities, such as it is a normal variant, there is a subtle glomerular abnormality, it is an exaggerated hemodynamic response, and it is due to a left renal vein entrapment.

# Etiology

There are several proposed mechanisms for the cause of orthostatic proteinuria:

- Normal variant

- Subtle glomerular abnormality

- Exaggerated hemodynamic response

- Left renal vein entrapment

Mahurkar et al. supported the normal variant mechanism. A study with 120 healthy male volunteers showed the difference in proteinuria with laying down versus standing up. The participants were from 11 to 36 years of age. Urine was collected after lying supine for one hour and then again after standing for one hour with only gentle walking allowed. Proteinuria was measured in both urine samples and was higher in 20% of the patients after standing for an hour, compared to the other 80%, who had a decrease in protein excretion with a corresponding reduction in creatinine clearance. The authors concluded that there might be a broader distribution curve for standing protein excretion.

Subtle glomerular abnormalities in the setting of abnormal glomerular hemodynamics may contribute to protein loss in patients with orthostatic proteinuria. A study by Sinniah et al. compared 55 young, healthy men in Singapore via renal biopsy. The subjects had either persistent proteinuria or orthostatic proteinuria. Men with orthostatic proteinuria showed subtle glomerular abnormalities that the researchers thought to be contributing to the proteinuria.

An exaggerated hemodynamic response could cause orthostatic proteinuria by increased efferent arteriolar resistance, likely from the action of angiotensin 2. An article by Vehaskari critiqued this mechanism, suggesting that orthostatic proteinuria is multifactorial and that the exaggerated hemodynamic response mechanism is probably only a contributing factor.

Left renal vein entrapment showed to be common in patients with orthostatic proteinuria.

# Epidemiology

Orthostatic proteinuria is the most frequent cause of isolated proteinuria in adolescents and children. It affects approximately 2 to 5% of adolescents and is uncommon after 30 years of age.

# Histopathology

Robinson et al. evaluated renal biopsies in patients with orthostatic proteinuria and noted these findings:

- Eosinophilic granules within capsular space in 67% of specimens

- Minimal to moderate thickening of the glomerular capillary wall in 43% of specimens

- Glomerular hypercellularity in 41% of specimens

- Focal capillary dilatation in 22% of specimens

# History and Physical

A thorough history and physical exam should be obtained from the patient with the assistance of their guardian if needed. Positive family history or past medical disease positive for the renal disease may suggest a pathology other than orthostatic proteinuria.

# Evaluation

In patients with suspected orthostatic proteinuria, the clinician should obtain a urinalysis from the first-morning void sample. If the first-morning urine has normal urinary protein, then these patients do not require further investigations for renal disease.

A urine protein-to-creatinine ratio can also help with the diagnosis. A normal urine protein/creatinine ratio in a recumbent position (less than 0.2mg/mg creatinine) with a high ratio in samples collected in a standing position establishes the diagnosis.

# Treatment / Management

There are no formal guidelines for monitoring patients with orthostatic proteinuria. However, the recommendation has been for annual follow-ups. Diet and physical activity should not be restricted.

Surgical intervention, including stenting for left renal vein entrapment, is not recommended to treat asymptomatic orthostatic proteinuria.

# Differential Diagnosis

Persistent proteinuria is a differential diagnosis that must be kept in mind. Other causes of proteinuria in children include transient proteinuria and persistent proteinuria such as Alport syndrome, diabetes mellitus, glomerulopathy, infections, malignancies, toxins, acute tubular necrosis, polycystic kidney disease, and proximal renal tubular acidosis.

# Prognosis

Orthostatic proteinuria is a benign condition. A 20-year follow-up by Springberg et al. in patients with orthostatic proteinuria did not find evidence for progressive renal disease.

In the follow-up evaluation by Springberg et al., they evaluated 64 patients that Robinson et al. had studied 20 years prior.

# Complications

There is no evidence of complications from orthostatic proteinuria as it is generally regarded as a benign condition.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patient education is an integral aspect of managing orthostatic proteinuria. While proteinuria is not normal, a patient should receive education regarding the clinical significance of this disease.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Orthostatic proteinuria is a benign and self-limiting disease seen mostly in children and young adults. There are no formal guidelines for monitoring, but several nephrologists have recommended at least yearly monitoring.
