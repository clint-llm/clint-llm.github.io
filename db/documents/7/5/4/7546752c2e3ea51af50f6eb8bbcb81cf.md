The disease process is typically self-limiting. Symptom control and supportive management are the basis for treatment of erythema infectiosum. Use acetaminophen and/or NSAIDs for fever control, arthralgias, and headache, if present. If an aplastic crisis is found on workup, then serial hemoglobin/hematocrit testing should be performed with red blood cell transfusions, as needed, throughout viral infection. If a mother is found to have acute parvovirus B19 infection early in pregnancy, she will need close follow-up with her obstetrician for serial ultrasounds and to monitor for fetal complications and hydrops fetalis.
