Traumatic brain injury patients require a thorough general trauma evaluation. All patients should be managed with advanced trauma life support measures. A detailed neurological examination is mandatory. A head CT scan is performed for the initial assessment of brain injury. Cervical X-rays or cervical CT scans must be performed to exclude associated cervical fractures as most injuries are secondary to falls.
