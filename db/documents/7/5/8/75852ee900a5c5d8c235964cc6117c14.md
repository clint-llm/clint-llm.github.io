Incontinentia pigmenti is a disorder of X-linked inheritance. Most affected individuals have a de novo mutation of the IKBKG (inhibitor of kappaB kinase gamma) or IKK gamma or NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO) gene on chromosome Xq28.

Normally, NF-kB protects against cell death; it is maintained within cells in an inactive state and becomes activated to induce an inflammatory response secondary to bacterial, viral, or stress. Derangement of IKBKG results in its inability to protect cells against apoptosis; hence more cell death occurs in response to stimuli.

Due to X-linked dominant inheritance, IP is usually lethal in males during embryogenesis.
