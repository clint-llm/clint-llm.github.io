Ocular and systemic conditions associated with damage at any level to the fifth cranial nerve, from the Trigeminal nucleus to the corneal nerve endings may lead to the development of neurotrophic keratitis. The most common causes include herpetic keratitis, chemical burns, long-term use of contact lenses, corneal surgery, ablative procedures for trigeminal neuralgia, and surgical procedures for reduction of jaw fractures. Other less frequent causes are space-occupying intracranial masses (e.g., schwannoma, meningioma and aneurysms) that can lead to compression of the nerve and reduce corneal sensitivity. Systemic diseases that may compromise trigeminal function like diabetes, multiple sclerosis and Leprosy may lead to the development of neurotrophic keratitis. Presence of neurotrophic keratitis in children is rare and may be seen in association with congenital syndromes like Riley-Day syndrome, Goldenhar- Gorlin syndrome, Mobius syndrome, Familial corneal hypesthesia and Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis
