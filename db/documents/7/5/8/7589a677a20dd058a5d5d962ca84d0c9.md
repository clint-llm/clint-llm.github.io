The human spine consists of seven cervical vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae, five lumbar vertebrae, five fused sacral vertebrae, and 3 to 5 fused coccyx vertebra. In the normal human spine, there is some degree of kyphosis in the thoracic spine and some degree of lordosis in the cervical and lumbar spine. Kyphosis is defined as an increase in the forward curvature of the spine that is seen along the sagittal plane, whereas lordosis is an increase in the backward curvature seen along the sagittal plane. When the forward curvature becomes excessive, this is called hyperkyphosis. Note that this is different than scoliosis, which is the curvature of the spine along the frontal plane.Â  The biomechanics that influences the curvature lies in the shape of the vertebral body and intervertebral disc, with an anterior wedge increasing the angle of kyphosis.
