Despite the heterogeneity of sarcomas, the most important prognostic factors are histologic grade and tumor size. Histologic grade predicts distant metastasis and survival, while primary tumor size predicts local recurrence and distant metastasis. Several predictive nomograms exist for local recurrence, distant metastasis, and overall survival. Memorial Sloan Kettering Sarcoma nomogram derived from their experience treating non-metastatic sarcomas from 1982-2006 predicts the risk of local recurrence at 3 and 5 years using grade, depth, size, margin status, age, and histology.

Age, tumor size, FNCLCC grade, and histologic subtype were found to have a significant effect on both overall survival and distant metastasis on multivariable analysis. In general, for localized and early-stage lesions, curative resection can be done with good long-term survival, but recurrences are common. For those with advanced disease, a cure is not possible, and the median survival is 12 to 18 months, depending on the subtype. The risk of recurrence even persists after 10 to 15 years, and patients need indefinite follow-up. The majority of recurrences occur within the first five years.Â Most sarcomas show a poor response to chemotherapy (10% to 50% response). The response also depends on histological subtype, grade, and patient.
