Hypercortisolism manifests as a multi-organÂ problem, often with multiple complications and comorbidities. Therefore, primary care providers caring for this patient population are often best served by seeking assistance from numerous other specialists in the diagnosis, clinical care, and subsequent follow up of these patients. The individual consultations required will vary from patient to patient based on the particular circumstances, but almost invariably the following consultations will be necessary: endocrinology, cardiology (for risk stratification in preparation for surgical interventions), clinical psychology and psychiatry, general surgery and/or neurosurgery as well as general medicine hospitalist service. It may also be necessary to consult with reproductive medicine, OBGYN, dermatology, hematology-oncology, sleep medicine, and infectious disease consultants, among others. In patients with exogenous HCM, close coordination of care between the PCP and the specialist(s) prescribed the etiologic glucocorticoids or other related medications is critical in planned dose tapers in preventing relapse of treated disease states and in the prevention of Addisonian crises from excessive glucocorticoid withdrawal.
