**Biceps Brachii and Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Joint**

The tendon of the long head of biceps attaches to the supraglenoid tubercle in the shoulder joint. Advanced osteoarthritic changes of the joint can lead to erosion and fraying of the tendon by osteophytes outgrowth, and the rupture of the tendon can occur.

**Volkmann Ischemic Contracture**

In cases like fracture of the humerus or bones of the forearm, spasmatic effects to the brachial artery either from a tight cast application or from the fracture itself can cause a decrease in blood supply to the arm muscles, eventually leading to necrosis and fibrosis of the muscles. Because the muscles on the flexor side are larger than the extensor muscles, they are more vulnerable to ischemia and necrosis. The result is permanent flexion deformity involving the upper limb due to ischemic contractures, and the deformity resembles aÂ claw-like deformity.

The presence of trigger points in the muscular areas of the arm can create dysfunctions in the function of the muscles themselves and peripheral neurological alterations (allodynia, hyperalgesia).
