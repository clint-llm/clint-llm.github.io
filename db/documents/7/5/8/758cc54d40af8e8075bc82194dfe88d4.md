The embryologic development of the adductor group is first evident in the proximal region of an 11 mm embryo with separation into independent masses for the different muscles of the group, including the adductor portion of the adductor magnus. When the embryo reaches 14 mm in length, the separate muscles are evident, but their tendons are not clearly separable. Concurrently, the hamstring portion of the adductor magnus differentiates from the muscle blastema of the dorsal thigh closely associated with that from which the semimembranosus muscle develops.  As the embryo reaches a length of 20 mm, the muscles of the adductor compartment and those in the posterior thigh compartment, along with their tendinous skeletal attachments, are clearly discernable—the adductor and hamstring portions of the adductor magnus fuse at this point in development. The nerves to both portions of the adductor magnus develop from the anterior division of the lumbosacral plexus, which suggests that both developmentally have a primitive flexor origin.
