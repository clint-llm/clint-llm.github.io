Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is found in approximately 2% to 3% of adults over age 50 and in 5% of adults older than the age of 70. MGUS is more common in men than in women (1.5:1) and 2 to 3-fold more common in African Americans compared to Caucasians. Non-IgM MGUS represents up to 85% of MGUS cases; IgM MGUS represents up to 15% of MGUS cases.
