In a patient with oliguria, a detailed history is required with a focus on past medical history (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, autoimmune disease, etc.), family history as well as the current medications (potential nephrotoxins).

The patient should be inquired about their occupation, hobbies, and recent travel as well. A thorough physical exam should be carried out to assess the hydration status of the patient (skin turgor, mucous membranes) as hemodynamic status can help in the identification of pre-renal causes of oliguria. Alternating episodes of oliguria and polyuria point towards a diagnosis of intermittent urinary tract obstruction.
