Overall, prehospital thrombolysis can dramatically reduce the time to restoration of blood flow to myocardium suffering from STEMI.  The ER-TIMI trial demonstrated that STEMI patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy in the prehospital setting received said therapy 32 minutes sooner than similar patients who received said therapy in the hospital.

Prehospital thrombolysis can improve STEMI to reperfusion times and mortality.  Serious consideration is necessary regarding all available resources, local populations, and QA/QI processes prior to implementing a prehospital thrombolysis program.
