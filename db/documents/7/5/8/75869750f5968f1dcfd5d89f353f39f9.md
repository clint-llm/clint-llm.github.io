The risk of complications is high in infants with FGR SGA in the neonatal period, throughout childhood and beyond.Â  Complications in the perinatal period include prematurity, perinatal asphyxia, impaired thermoregulation, hypoglycemia, polycythemia and hyperviscosity, impaired immune function, and hypocalcemia. Infants with FGR SGA are at increased risk of premature delivery and those with FGR SGA who are born preterm have increased risk for death and prematurity-related complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis, respiratory distress syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Infants with FGR SGA are prone to additional hypoxic stress of uterine contraction during delivery and, with impaired placenta function, there is an increased risk of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, ischemic heart failure, meconium aspiration, pulmonary hypertension, and kidney and gastrointestinal injury.

Immunity is impaired for FGR SGA infants as both T and B peripheral lymphocytes are found to be decreased at birth in patients with FGR SGA due to stress-induced erythropoiesis, although the number of T lymphocyte normalized later in childhood but not its proliferative potential.

Infants born FGR SGA are at higher risk of long-term complications including chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.
