The transport of oxygen is fundamental to aerobic respiration and the survival of complex organisms. The lungs, heart, vasculature, and red blood cells play essential roles in oxygen transport. Oxygen-carrying deficiencies or problems with oxygen transport or delivery are common sequelae of medical illness and must be promptlyÂ evaluated and corrected to prevent irreversible tissue damage.
