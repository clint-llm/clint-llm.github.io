The pathophysiology of pancreatic serous cystadenomas is not well understood. The morphologic and immunohistochemical features of the serous neoplasms favor the centroacinar, intralobular, and ductular cells of the pancreas. The WHO classified them into serous microcystic adenomas and serous macrocystic (oligocystic) adenomas.

Macrocystic serous cystadenomas include both previous serous oligocystic and the ill-demarcated serous adenoma. Solid serous adenomas are well-circumscribed and have a solid gross appearance; they have the cytologic and immunohistologic features of the classic serous cystadenomas. Serous cystadenomas that occur in VHL syndrome involve the entire pancreas or in a patchy fashion. The mixed serous neuroendocrine neoplasm is a rare entity of serous cystadenomas that is associated with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. This is also suggestive of VHL syndrome.
