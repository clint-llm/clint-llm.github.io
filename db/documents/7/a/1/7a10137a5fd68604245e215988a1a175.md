Microscopic examination of involved tissues reveals iron deposition. Liver biopsy can show hemosiderosis on iron staining (Prussian blue or Perls' iron stain) as well as cirrhosis if liver disease is advanced. Liver biopsy is also useful for patients with cirrhosis and liver lesions suspected to be hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver biopsy with a Hepatic Iron Index (HII) has been the standard of diagnosis. With the advent of genetic testing, liver biopsy is utilized less frequently. Microscopic pancreatic islet beta-cell examination can reveal iron deposition.
