While there are no specific indicators for the use of McRobert's maneuver,Â there are several antepartum and intrapartum conditions that can place a patient at a higher risk of developing shoulder dystocia. Antepartum conditions include diabetes, previous large birthweight infant, increased maternal weight gain, and maternal obesity.

No advantage has been observed with performing prophylactic McRobert's maneuver prior to shoulder dystocia diagnosis, however, there are minimal to no disadvantages in using the maneuver prophylactically.
