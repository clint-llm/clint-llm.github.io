Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disorder and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, infectious disease expert, and laboratory specialist. The diagnosis can be confirmed by culture but if the disorder is suspected, treatment should be initiated without delay.

The treatment of leptospirosis depends on the severity. Most experts suggest withholding antibiotics in mild cases. These individuals will benefit from fluids as well as pain and fever control.Â If the infection is severe, one may use intravenous penicillin G, third-generation cephalosporins, or erythromycin.

In severe cases, renal, lung, and CNS involvement may occur and are associated with very high mortality. These patients need ICU admission and monitoring.
