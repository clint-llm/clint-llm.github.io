Pancreatic islet cell transplantation can reduce the number of unrecognized, hypoglycemic episodes refractory to medical management. The procedure has also had success in helping patients achieve independence from exogenous insulin administration. This procedure is less invasive than a solid organ pancreas transplant and is considered one of the safest transplant procedures with the potential to cure type I diabetes. Current research focuses heavily on promoting cell survival after transplantation. Inhibitory receptors within islet cells have shown to promote both function and survival under inflammatory and hyperglycemic stress states following graft transplantation.
