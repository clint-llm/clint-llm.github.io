In the ninth week of the fetal period, there is undifferentiated mesenchyme that is located in the anterior part of the urethra, which develops into the external urethral sphincter. The external urethral sphincter is also known as rhabdosphincter. Later, around the 12th week, striated muscle fibers start to develop. The internal urethral sphincter is thought to arise from the absorption of the Wolffian duct into the bladder and urethra.
