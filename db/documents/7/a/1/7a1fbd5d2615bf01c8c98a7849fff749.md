DVT and PE are significant complications of superficial thrombophlebitis. Multiple studies have found concomitant DVT with SVT in 6 to 36% of patients. These same studies clinically suspected concomitant PE in 2 to 13%, and regular performance of lung scans revealed the rate of asymptomatic PE approached 33%.
