The diagnosis and management of byssinosis is not always easy and is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a primary care physician, internist, pulmonologist, nurse practitioner, pathologist, and a radiologist. The key aspect of treatment is removing the patient from further exposure. Some patients may benefit from bronchodilators and steroid inhalers. Patients need to be educated on discontinuing smoking and wearing a mask when working with cotton fabrics.

The outlook for patients with byssinosis is guarded. While some do improve, many continue to have progression of the disease and develop severe respiratory distress even at rest.
