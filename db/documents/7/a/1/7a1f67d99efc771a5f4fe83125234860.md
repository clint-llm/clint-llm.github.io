Embolization of uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) has been performed since 1995. Because the embolization procedure is performed either solely or primarily through the uterine artery, the procedure is often referred to as uterine artery embolization (UAE).  Some authors prefer to refer to the procedure as uterine fibroid embolization or UFE, but UAE has indications other than for treatment of fibroids, so the term UAE is preferred here.

The procedure's technical success is defined as delivery of the embolic particles to their intendend distention.  Technical success of bilateral UAE by experienced physicians is about 95%.

The goal of therapy is to relieve symptoms, and not all women whose procedures are deemed to be a technical success remain symptom free, as discussed later.  Symptom improvement from fibroid tumor therapy is correlated with tumor death.  A retrospective review of 84 fibroids treated over one year showed an average decrease in the size of 60%.  Submucosally located fibroids showed the greatest shrinkage, while subserosally located fibroids showed the least.  Ten percent of the fibroids increased in size.
