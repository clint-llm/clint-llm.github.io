Historical factors are exceptionally useful when making the diagnosis of bowel perforation. Lower chest or abdominal pain after recent instrumentation from endoscopy/colonoscopy or laparoscopic/open surgical procedure should raise high suspicion for this diagnosis. Previous medical, surgical, and social history to include a history of a prior hernia, bowel obstruction, known or suspected malignancy, foreign body insertion or ingestion, abdominal trauma, and regular medication use (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy are the most common) should be elicited. The patient is likely to complain of pain and distension in the abdomen that is worsening. Patients may describe a pain-free period before the worsening of their pain, and this can represent decompression of an inflamed or injured area directly following the perforation.

Diffuse spillage of air and intestinal contents may make the pain difficult to localize during focused abdominal examination, but palpation is likely to identify tenderness. Patients usually have nausea and vomiting. As the situation progresses, peritoneal signs such as guarding and rigidity may develop. Vital signs may be normal, especially in early presentation; however, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and other signs of sepsis are likely to develop.
