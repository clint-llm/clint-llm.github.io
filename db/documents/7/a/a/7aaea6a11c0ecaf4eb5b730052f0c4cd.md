Although there is no diagnostic test for opioid withdrawal, urine toxicology must be checked to rule out withdrawal from any other drugs or combination of drugs. Urine toxicology is positive for most opioids such as morphine, heroin, codeine, oxycodone, and propoxyphene) for 12 to 36 hours after use. Methadone, buprenorphine, and LAAM (L-alpha-acetylmethadol) will not be detected in positive urine opiate tests, and they must be specifically tested. Urine toxicology for other drugs (marijuana, cocaine, benzodiazepine, and amphetamines) may also be commonly positive in opiate users. ECG, complete blood count (CBC), blood alcohol level, and basic metabolic panel (BMP) should also be done.

COWS (Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale) assessment for opioid withdrawal is commonly used to determine the severity of opioid withdrawal.
