About a quarter of strokes and TIAs occur in the vertebrobasilar distribution. Like the prevalence of atherosclerotic disease, vertebrobasilar disease occurs later in life, particularly around the 7 to 8Â decades, with a predilection for the male gender. As many as 25% of the elderly population present with impaired balance and increased fall risks as a consequence of VBI. Similar to other types of stroke syndromes, African Americans are more prevalent than other ethnic groups due to multiple reasons including genetics, higher prevalence of hypertension and differences in healthcare delivery.
