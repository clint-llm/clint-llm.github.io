The formation of corneal arcus is dependent upon the vasculature of the limbus (the border between the cornea and the sclera). The arcus initially forms in the superior and inferior regions of the cornea, because these regions have greater perfusion than the central cornea. The regions that have greater perfusion also have capillaries that have greater permeability. Current theories suggest that lipids such as cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides, and lipoproteins are preferentially delivered to the more perfused regions of the cornea and the arcus form when the lipids and lipoproteins extend beyond the reach of the small vessels and thus get deposited in these peripheral regions.
