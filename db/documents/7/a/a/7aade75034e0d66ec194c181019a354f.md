Procedures are performed by a trained physician with a thorough knowledge of possible complications and protocols for treating them. A nurse should be present to assist throughout the procedure. If fluoroscopy (or CT or MRI) is being used, a fluoroscopy technician or other personnel to operate imaging machinery must be present to assist with C-arm adjustments and imaging.
