Campylobacter is a leading cause of diarrhea in both the developing and the developed world that has become increasingly prevalent. In March 2013, the CDC reported a 14% increase in C. jejuni cases in the United States. One percent of the human population of Europe is affected yearly by campylobacteriosis. In developing countries, Campylobacter isolation rates for food-borne illness are between 5% to 20%.  Campylobacteriosis can occur in all age groups though it affects predominately pediatric patients in developing countries. In the developed world, 90% of cases occur during the summer months which is believed to be related to under-cooked meat at outdoor facilities. The condition most commonly affects children under 4 years old and young adults between 15 to 44 years of age.

The worldwide prevalence of the disease highlights the ability of Campylobacter to survive in a wide range of environments. Routes of transmission to humans include consumption of contaminated food and water, contact with animals, and person-to-person contact.Campylobacter is difficult to control. The CDC has made efforts to educate the public about the signs and symptoms of disease and disease prevention for those traveling to countries that pose a high risk of contact with infected sources. These efforts include hand hygiene, separating raw meats from other food when cooking, the thorough cooking of food and avoidance of raw dairy and untreated water.
