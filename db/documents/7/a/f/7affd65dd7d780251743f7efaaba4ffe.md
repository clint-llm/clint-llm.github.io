**Nonopioid Analgesic Agents**

- **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)**: It is considered a safe medication if used appropriately. Since toxicity usually occurs at doses above 150 mg/kg, the therapeutic index is estimated to be around 10.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: There is no need for routine monitoring of NSAID acute administration in healthy patients. However, patients who use NSAIDs chronically (eg., rheumatoid arthritis) and patients considered at increased risk for NSAID toxicity (eg., liver or renal disease) should have an evaluation including CBC, renal, and hepatic function tests as a minimum. Other tests may be ordered depending on clinical suspicion and findings.

- **Antidepressant medications**
- Amitriptyline: Allow 6 to 8 weeks for an adequate trial. If patients achieve adequate pain relief but do not tolerate the adverse reactions, consider switching to another TCA such as imipramine or nortriptyline. Consider switching the dose to bedtime to treat concurrent insomnia or if the patient experiences daytime somnolence. Patients should be monitored periodically with the following parameters: heart rate, blood pressure, ECG (older adults or preexisting cardiac disease), blood glucose, weight and BMI, electrolyte panel (high-risk population). Additionally, patients should undergo evaluation for suicide ideations and mood lability.
- Duloxetine: Allow 6 to 8 weeks for an adequate trial. Patients should be monitored periodically with blood pressure measurements (especially in patients with hypertension), liver and renal function tests (as clinically indicated), blood glucose and HbA in diabetic patients, and serum sodium in populations at high risk for complications. Additionally, clinicians should evaluate patients for suicide ideations.

- **Antiepileptic medications**: Healthcare personnel should evaluate baseline creatinine levels before and during the treatment for patients under treatment for either gabapentin or pregabalin. Additionally, patients should do followed up for periodical screenings of depression, behavioral changes, and suicidality.

- **Local anesthetics**: Since lidocaine has a narrow therapeutic index, patients with severe hepatic impairment, under prolonged infusions, or with broken or inflamed skin should be monitored for increased plasma levels. Additionally, there are documented cases of methemoglobinemia with a related use of local anesthetics, although they are extremely rare related to patches administration. Signs of methemoglobinemia include cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood.

**Opioid Agents**

Clinicians should evaluate their patients on a periodical basis. Follow-ups should focus on the level of pain control and the physical examination (vital signs, signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction; respiratory and mental status; signs or symptoms of hypogonadism or hypoadrenalism).
