Pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, which can progress to CTO lesions, has multiple contributing factors, which include upregulation of the immunologic and inflammatory markers (cytokines, leukocytes, high sensitivity C-reactive protein),Â  endothelial dysfunction, and cholesterol accumulation. Most commonly, it starts with the collection of smooth muscle cells within the intima, and this progresses to macrophages accumulating in the intima leading to pathologic intimal thickening and progression of lesions.
