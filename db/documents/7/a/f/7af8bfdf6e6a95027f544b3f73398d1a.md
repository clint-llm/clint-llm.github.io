Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal infection found in women of reproductive age and is estimated to occur in anywhere from 5 to 70% of women.

Epidemiological data showed that women are more likely to report bacterial vaginosisÂ if they have had multiple sexual partners, are unmarried, began to engage in intercourse at a young age, if they are commercial sex workers, or practice regularly douching.
