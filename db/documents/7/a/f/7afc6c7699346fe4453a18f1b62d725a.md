In the eighteenth century, Henri Duret confirmed that trauma resulted in variations in the distribution of cerebrospinal fluid, which in turn caused changes in pressure in the spaces where the fluid circulates e.g., the cerebral aqueduct. He noted microhemorrhages in the brainstem in the surrounding tissue as “action of a pressure increases in the cerebrospinal fluid due to sudden accumulation, which caused a linear hemorrhage on the medulla’s thickness and around the central canal.”
