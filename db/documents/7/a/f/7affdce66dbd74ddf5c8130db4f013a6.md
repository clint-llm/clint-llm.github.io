Candidates for genetic evaluation:

Genetic evaluation for HNPCC should be considered in the following individuals:

- All patients diagnosed with CRC.

- Patients with endometrial cancer diagnosed before age 60 years.

- With a first-degree relative of those with HNPCC and related cancers.

- Patients with CRC and prediction models suggesting >5 percent chance of MMR gene mutation.

- Positive family history of cancer that meets the criteria of Amsterdam I or II or revised Bethesda guidelines.

Tumor evaluation —  Tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing are done initially for genetic evaluation. The absence of MSI and intact expression of all four MMR proteins on IHC rules out most cases of HNPCC. In individuals with evidence of high MSI (MSI-H) or loss of expression of MMR protein, further evaluation is done based on the MSI/IHC results.

Germline testing — The mutation in the MMR (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) or EPCAM gene establish the diagnosis of HNPCC. Germline testing should be offered to the following individuals:

- Patients with microsatellite unstable tumors by MSI/IHC testing.

- If tumor testing is not feasible and if the clinical suspicion of HNPCC is strong (e.g., individual meets revised Bethesda criteria).

- In some cases, when a patient meets the Amsterdam criteria, without prior tumor testing.
