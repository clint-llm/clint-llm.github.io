Complement activation pathways are tightly regulated and have multiple points of inhibition to protect normal tissue from complement dysregulation, and include MCP, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), MAC-inhibitory protein (CD59 or protectin), and the previously described Factor H. MCP deactivates C3b while DAF facilitates the destruction of C3bBb (C3 convertase).
