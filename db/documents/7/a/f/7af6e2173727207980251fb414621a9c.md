UBC: UBC develops in the metaphysis and gradually grows away from the physis and is known for spontaneous resolution, as evidenced by the fact that UBC is rare in adults.

Active cysts are those that are very near the growth plate while inactive cysts are those that have grown away from growth or not in direct contact with growth plate.

ABC: Recurrence rate after curettage of ABC is approximately 10 to 20%. Age younger than 15 years, central location, and incomplete removal of the cystic cavity are known risk factors for recurrence. Complete surgical resection is reserved for more dispensible bones like the clavicle and fibula, where partial bone excision does not cause any significant long term morbidity.
