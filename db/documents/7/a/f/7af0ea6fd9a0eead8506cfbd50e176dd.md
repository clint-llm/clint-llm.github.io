- Hemifacial spasm is involuntary, repetitive contraction of facial muscles, almost always unilateral, non-suppressible, and persists even during sleep.

- In most cases, underlying etiology is a facial nerve compression by an aberrant or ectatic blood vessel at the exit from the brainstem.

- The diagnosis is usually clinical based on the history and physical exam of a patient. EMG and MRI are done to identify the underlying cause before planning the treatment.

- In many cases, the condition leads to significant social embarrassment, anxiety, and depression among the patients. In most severe cases, functional blindness resulting from sudden, persistent, involuntary closure of the eye might be risky to the patient and others, such as driving. Accurate diagnosis and timely management, along with patient education, are key elements to improve the quality of life of these patients.

- Botulinum toxin is the treatment of choice in treating hemifacial spasm due to its tremendous efficacy (success rate of 85% to 95%) and less incidence of side effects. However, it gives only temporary symptomatic relief. Onabotulinum toxin A is the most widely used commercially available botulinum toxin in the United States.

- Microvascular decompression is the only therapeutic modality that addresses the underlying cause, thereby leading to a complete cure with an average success rate of 85%.
