Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory disorder that presents as well-defined, scaly, erythematous plaques, and occasionally, sterile pustules. Guttate psoriasis is a distinct variant of psoriasis that is classically triggered by streptococcal infection (pharyngitis or perianal) and is more common in children and adolescents than adults. Patients present with several, small drop-like lesions that respond well to topical and phototherapies. This activity describes the pathophysiology and presentation of guttate psoriasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of guttate psoriasis.
- Recall the presentation of guttate psoriasis.
- List the treatment and management options available for guttate psoriasis.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with guttate psoriasis.
