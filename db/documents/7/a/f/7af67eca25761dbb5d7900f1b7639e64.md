The best treatment for patellofemoral arthritis is prevention. Prevention is aimed at maintaining the strength of the quadriceps, hip, and core. Activity modification in patients developing patellofemoral pain can slow the progression of the disease. Maintaining a healthy weight can also reduce the stress load on the patellofemoral joint.
