Several etiological factors have been implicated in the progression of TED, which may also be linked to dysthyroid optic neuropathy. Thyroid status impairment is one of the most important associations. The majority of cases of DON are associated with hyperthyroidism. This can be attributed to the fact that hyperthyroidism is the most common form of thyroid dysfunction in TED.

It is worth noting that hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, or even a euthyroid status may be found in relation to DON.Â Radio-active Iodine (RAI) therapy, a well-known risk factor for TED progression, may increase the incidence of DON, although any meaningful evidence is lacking.****A recent study has discovered a correlation between early-onset DON and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin positivity.****

It has also been shown that in patients with diabetic vasculopathy, especially those on injectable insulin, hypoxia of the optic nerve occurs, leading to subsequent nerve damage.
