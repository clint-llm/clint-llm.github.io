The postoperative care by nursing staff includes cold compresses for 24-48 hrs to control edema. The patient should be closely observed for any deterioration in vision in the first 24 hours. Postoperative instructions include head elevation and avoidance of strenuous activity to decrease edema, lower intraocular pressure, and to decrease chances of hemorrhage. Oral analgesics and antibiotics are prescribed in the early postoperative period. Ocular lubrication is recommended in all patients and is particularly important in patients with preexisting dry eyes or post-surgery lagophthalmos. Along with lubrication, topical antibiotic-steroid ointment can be given to prevent and resolve chemosis.
