The clinical spectrum of relapsing polychondritis varies with the duration and severity of disease. Auricular involvement is present in 90% of cases, and inflammation is restricted to the cartilaginous portion of the ear, with relative sparing of the ear lobes. Patients most frequently present with discoloration and pain of the ear. Articular involvement is the second most common manifestation and is present in 50% to 75% of patients. Wrist, metacarpophalangeal, and proximal interphalangeal joints are commonly involved. Ocular manifestations occur in 20% to 60% of relapsing polychondritis patients and include episcleritis, scleritis, keratitis, and uveitis. Nasal chondritis occurs in about 25% of cases. Inflammation of the cartilaginous rings around the trachea and bronchi results in the collapse of these airways (tracheobronchomalacia). Such patients present with a cough, hoarseness of voice, and wheezing. Respiratory compromise is the most frequent cause of death in these patients.
