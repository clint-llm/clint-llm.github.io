As mentioned previously, AVPD was initially believed to represent a classification within the spectrum of pathological anxiety. Experts postulated that the phenomenology of AVPD could only exist in parallel with SAD; however, this assumption has since been dispelled, as roughly two-thirds of individuals with AVPD do not meet the standard criteria for SAD.

The pervasive isolation witnessed in both AVPD and schizoid personality disorder can be diagnostically differentiated by contrasting the active-detachment of AVPD against the schizoid trait of passive-detachment. The former constitutes a state of "actively" avoiding social engagement with the impetus to circumvent rejection, whereas the latter ambivalent "passive" isolation precipitates from a complete lack of interest. Furthermore, those who have schizoid personality disorder are insensitive to social rejection and indifferent to interpersonal engagement.
