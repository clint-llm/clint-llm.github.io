There are no guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of ethosuximide. Dosing can be adjusted purely on the patient's clinical response to a particular dose and electroencephalogram (EEG). Ethosuximide level checking is done as a trough. The therapeutic range for ethosuximide is between 40 to 100 mcg/ml. Higher levels than 100 mcg/ml are usually tolerable without toxicity. Patients in absence status epilepticus may need serum concentrations higher than 120 mcg/ml to achieve seizure control.

Enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital can reduce serum concentrations of ethosuximide by accelerating its elimination.

Isoniazid may reduce ethosuximide metabolism, while rifampicin can increase ethosuximide clearance.
