The EKG in a patient with coarctation can demonstrate increased voltage in the lateral precordial leads consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy. The echocardiogram will demonstrate left ventricular hypertrophy. In neonates, the left ventricular function can be diminished. There also can be mitral regurgitation and left atrial dilation from elevated left atrial pressures. The echocardiogram can demonstrate a narrowing in the aortic arch at the level of the isthmus (just beyond the left subclavian) with Doppler velocities increased in this region, but the arch can also appear hypoplastic. The abdominal aortic pulsations are decreased with diastolic runoff. CT scanning and MRI are useful to provide detailed anatomy of the aortic arch before and after treatment.
