When using 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, no follow-up is needed as the epithelial layer and adhesive will spontaneously slough off in 5 to 10 days.Â After applying 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, it is essential to maintain good wound hygiene, avoiding excess scrubbing or picking that may increase dehiscence rates. While 2-octyl cyanoacrylate is a waterproof barrier, it is advisable to avoid prolonged exposure to water that may cause premature erosion of the adhesive. No topical antibiotics or other medications should be applied on top of the adhesive, as this may adversely affect the barrier integrity. As with all wounds, patients should be instructed to monitor closely for signs of wound dehiscence or infection such as erythema, edema, or purulent discharge.
