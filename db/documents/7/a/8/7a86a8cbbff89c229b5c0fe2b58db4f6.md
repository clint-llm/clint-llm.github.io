The supraorbital nerve block is a procedure performed to provide immediate localized anesthesia for a multitude of injuries such as complex lacerations to the forehead, upper eyelid laceration repair, debridement of abrasions or burns to the forehead, removal of foreign bodies from the forehead, or pain relief from acute herpes zoster. A regional block allows for minimal anesthetic use, which permits the operator to obtain the intended anesthesia over a larger surface area versus that of local infiltration. This activity reviews the indications for a supraorbital nerve block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with facial injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of supraorbital nerve block.
- Review the indications for a supraorbital nerve block. 
- Summarize the complications of a supraorbital nerve block.
- Explain the importance of care coordination among the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing a supraorbital nerve block.
