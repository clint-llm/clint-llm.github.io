Obstructive jaundice is a common condition that may result from malignant or benign diseases. Before endoscopic biliary stenting, which was introduced in the early 1980s, surgery was the primary treatment for cases of biliary obstruction. Surgical options for obstructive jaundice included Whipple procedure with hepaticojejunostomy, cholecystojejunostomy, choledochojejunostomy, or other procedures according to the predisposing condition.Â Biliary stents are tubes made of plastic or metal to relieve obstruction in the biliary tree or to treat biliary leaks.
