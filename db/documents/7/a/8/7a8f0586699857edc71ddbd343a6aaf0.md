The incidence of major complications related to left heart catheterization is low, and the majority of the deaths occurring post-procedure are secondary to acute illness. The most common complications associated with left heart catheterization may include access site complications, contrast allergy, cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and aortic or coronary artery dissection.

Access site complications may include bleeding, hematoma formation, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistulae, perforation, and the artery's dissection.

Myocardial infarction during left heart catheterization is reported as 0.2 per 10,000 procedures, and coronary artery dissection causes myocardial infarction in almost all the cases. The incidence of cardiac tamponade is reported as low as 0.009% for a diagnostic left heart catheterization.

Contrast related complications include allergic reaction and contrast-induced renal dysfunction. Urticaria is the common manifestation of contrast related allergy and but it can lead to anaphylaxis. Contrast-induced nephropathy is a serious complication of cardiac catheterization, and it is much more common in the presence of underlying renal dysfunction, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Although there is no definite treatment of contrast-induced nephropathy, it can be prevented by minimizing the contrast volume, preventing volume depletion, and avoiding renal vasoconstriction activation.
