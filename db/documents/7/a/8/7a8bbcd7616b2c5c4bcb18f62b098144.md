The first step in treatment is significant dietary modifications. This includes a major reduction in the intake of plant sterols and shellfish sterols. Common examples include vegetable oils, nuts, and avocados. Patients often experience a measurable reduction in serum sterol levels and cholesterol levels following the dietary intervention.

Medications are generally required to fully control the chronic disease process of sitosterolemia. At a dosage of 10 mg per day, ezetimibe is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of sitosterolemia. It works directly by blocking plant sterol entry and consequently lowers serum plant sterol levels. Other medication options include bile-acid binding resins such as cholestyramine. However, this would only be used in conjunction with ezetimibe. Prior to the approval of ezetimibe, surgical intervention with an ileal bypass was reserved for severe cases.

Statin therapy is not directly indicated for the treatment of sitosterolemia. Likely, it would be prescribed for affected patients given its cardioprotective effect in the setting of atherosclerosis. It would also help optimize the lipid profile of the patient to minimize other cardiac risks. However, it would not lower plant sterol serum levels, and hence statin therapy alone is not an appropriate treatment for sitosterolemia.
