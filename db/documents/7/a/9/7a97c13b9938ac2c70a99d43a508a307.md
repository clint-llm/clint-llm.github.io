The underlying premise of radiation therapy is to expose the body to treatments that destroy or impede malignant cells more efficiently than healthy cells. Therefore, there will inevitably be damage to nearby cells. In radiation therapy of the spine, there is an obvious concern for damage to the spinal cord itself. This risk should be minimized by targeted stereotactic treatments and ample pre-procedural planning.

Research into radiation therapy reveals that damage is not limited to cells in close proximity to the target cells. Gap-junction or cytokine-mediated cellular toxicity can lead to damage in cells far from the targeted radiation track. This phenomenon is coined the "bystander effect." The bystander effect results in genomic instabilities that lead to cell death, the formation of micronuclei, sister chromatid exchanges, and a delay in the cell cycle of non-irradiated cells. The outcome of this bystander damage can lead to unintended consequences in peripheral healthy tissues.

There is debate on whether radiation therapy should be given prior to palliative surgery or after in cases where resection is indicated. Post-operative radiation therapy is given in a higher dose due to a larger treatment field, resulting in a higher incidence of local fibrosis and lymphedema. PreoperativeÂ radiation therapy, in contrast, has a higher risk of wound complications than post-operative radiation.
