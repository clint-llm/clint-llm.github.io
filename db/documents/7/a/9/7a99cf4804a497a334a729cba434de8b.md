It is imperative to distinguish ornithineÂ transcarbamylase deficiency from other genetic disorders that cause hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia can be caused by other urea cycle disorders as well as by organic acidemias, defects of fatty oxidation and disorders of pyruvate metabolism. Signs in the patient's bloodwork that limit the differential to a urea cycle disorder will include respiratory alkalosis with a normal anion gap, normal blood sugar levels, and severe ammonia levels on the order of 1000micromol/L.
