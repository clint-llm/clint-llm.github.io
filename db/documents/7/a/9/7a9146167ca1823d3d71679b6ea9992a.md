The only absoluteÂ contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen therapy is untreated pneumothorax. Relative contraindications include claustrophobia, obstructive lung disease, asymptomatic pulmonary blebs on chest radiograph, upper respiratory or sinus infections, recent ear or thoracic surgery, and uncontrolled therapy. However, these relative contraindications should not automatically deter clinicians from considering hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
