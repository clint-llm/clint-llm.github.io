Complications that may occur with TEV include loss of mobility, disability, and decreased quality of life. Treatment complications can include typical cast complications, including skin breakdown, and nerve injury related to pressure over superficial nerves. These are mitigated by the frequent cast changes utilized with the Ponseti method. Weakness in eversion with inversion while dorsiflexing the foot can be seen after non-operative management. Weakness is typically managed with an anterior tibialis tendon transfer. Rocker-bottom foot deformity can also occur, typically this happens as a result of trying to correct the equinus deformity before the adduction and varus deformities.
