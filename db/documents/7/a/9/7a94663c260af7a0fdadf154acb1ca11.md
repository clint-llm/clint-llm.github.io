Surface decompression (Sur-D) is a decompression technique used primarily in military and commercial surface-supplied diving. On a Sur-D schedule, the first part of a diver's decompression is completed in the water. The remainder is completed in a deck decompression chamber (DDC) after the diver surfaces.
