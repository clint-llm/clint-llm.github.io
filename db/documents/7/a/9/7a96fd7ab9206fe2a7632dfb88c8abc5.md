The most effective management of diabetes mellitus demands an interprofessional approach involving both lifestyle modifications with diet and exercise and pharmacologic therapies as needed to meet individualized glycemic goals. Healthcare practitioners must encourage patients to combine lifestyle modifications with oral pharmacologic agents for optimal glycemic control, particularly as type 2 diabetes mellitus progresses with continued loss of pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin production.

**Oral Hypoglycemic Medications**

- Sulfonylureas (glipizide, glyburide, gliclazide, glimepiride)

- Meglitinides (repaglinide and nateglinide)

- Biguanides (metformin)

- Thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone)

- α-Glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose)

- DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin)

- SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin and canagliflozin)

- Cycloset (bromocriptine)

**FDA-approved indications**for the use of oral hypoglycemic drugs primarily focus on type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Non-FDA approved indications**of oral hypoglycemic drugs, such as metformin, are for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus, treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with menstrual irregularities, and prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in PCOS patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF), and management of antipsychotic-induced weight gain.
