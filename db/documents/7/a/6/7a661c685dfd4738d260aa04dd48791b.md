It is important to gather a complete past medical and surgical history when evaluating for pregnancy and diagnosing an intrauterine pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease, an intrauterine device (IUDs), prior ectopic pregnancies, and dysplasia are all risk factors for ectopic pregnancies. Additionally, infertility treatment increases the risk of heterotopic pregnancies.

It should also be noted that favorable visualization using transabdominal ultrasound of the reproductive organs can be limited by a large body habitus and an empty bladder. A full bladder offers an ideal acoustic window for a transabdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound is a modality that is user-dependent.

Limitations to serum or urine qualitative HCG testing was described above (see specimen collection).
