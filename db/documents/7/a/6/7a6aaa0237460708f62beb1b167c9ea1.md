While the diagnosis of adult acquired flatfoot is relatively straightforward, there are several diagnoses that a provider needs to rule out when acquired flatfoot is suspected. These include adult flexible flatfoot, tarsal coalition, Charcot foot, neuromuscular flatfoot, and arthritic, post-traumatic, and iatrogenic deformity. A careful history and physical can rule out most of these etiologies.
