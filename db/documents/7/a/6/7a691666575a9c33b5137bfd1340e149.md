Physical examination can detect abnormal pleural fluid accumulation, and chest x-ray, followed by an evaluation by thoracentesis and pleural fluid analysis can determine the cause of the effusion. A thoracentesis typically is indicated if a clinically significant pleural effusion is present that is radiographically at least 10 mm thick. Pleural fluid accumulations can be further evaluated by gross appearance, clinical microscopy, cytopathologic findings, microbiology, pH, tumor markers, and other chemical studies.

**The Light Criteria**

The Light criteria are used to determine if an effusion is exudative or transudative.

- Pleural fluid protein/Serum protein greater than 0.5

- Pleural fluid LDH/Serum LDH greater than 0.6

- Pleural fluid LDH greater than 2/3 *Serum LDH upper limit of the reference range
