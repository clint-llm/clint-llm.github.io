Three primary signaling centers, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), and the nonridged ectoderm, interact in a well-coordinated manner to direct appropriate developmental axis formation for the upper extremity.

By the end of the sixth week of embryonic development, chondrocytes have formed a basic construct of hyaline cartilage that will eventually ossify into the bones of the upper extremity through the process of endochondral ossification. The MCP joints are formed in this cartilage when factor signaling causes chondrogenesis to cease locally, ultimately resulting in the formation of a joint cavity. Mesenchymal cells adjacent to the joint cavity subsequently differentiate into the joint capsule. By the ninth week, the diaphyses of the metacarpal and proximal phalanges are ossified; however, the epiphyses are ossified postnatally.
