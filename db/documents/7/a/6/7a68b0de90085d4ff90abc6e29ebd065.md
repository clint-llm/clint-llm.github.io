VF occurs when parts of ventricular myocardium depolarize erratically in an uncoordinated manner. VF results fromÂ the following:

**Abnormal Impulse Formation
**

- Increased automaticity: Purkinje cells around ischemic areas during MI can initiate ventricular tachycardia.

- Triggered activity: Early and late after depolarization can overcome refractory threshold and generate triggered potential causing extrasystoles.

**Impulse Conduction
**

- Functional and anatomical reentry circuits help sustain ventricular arrhythmia.
