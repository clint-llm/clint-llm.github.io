Arrhythmias with pre-excitation origins are estimated to occur in 1 to 3 per 1000 people in the United States, and 60% to 70% of patients discovered to have evidence of pre-excitation, generally detected on routine electrocardiograms, have no other heart disease.

AVNRT is the most common paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Approximately 89,000 new cases of SVT are discovered each year, with roughly half a million people in the United States currently living with SVTs. AVNRT is more common in females, and this difference is due to the female hormones and autonomic tone.

The global burden of atrial fibrillation has increased exponentially over the last five decades due to population aging.
