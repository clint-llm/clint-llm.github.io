After conducting a full psychiatric history, it is imperative to conduct a thorough systems review and a mental state examination where appearance, behavior, mood, speech, cognition, and insight need to be assessed, alongside determining evidence of perceptual delusions or formal thought disorders. Though schizophrenia is primarily a clinical diagnosis, specific laboratory and radiographic investigations are useful to exclude other potential causes:

- Urea and electrolytes - an electrolyte imbalance can cause delirium

- Serum calcium - hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism can, on occasion, have psychiatric manifestations

- Blood glucose - hypoglycemia can produce confusion which can be mistaken for psychosis

- Thyroid function tests - depression is associated with hypothyroidism and may present with psychotic features - severe hyperthyroidism also correlates with changes in mental state

- 24-hour cortisol collection - both hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) and adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison disease) can present with psychiatric symptoms

- 24 hour catecholamine/5-HIAA collection - in cases of suspected phaeochromocytoma/carcinoid syndrome

- Urinary toxicology screen - detection of recreational drugs such as cannabis

- CT head/MRI - in cases of significant neurological impairment or suspected neurological abnormality

- HIV/syphilis serology - both infections can cause psychiatric symptoms
