The differential diagnosis of anterior compartment syndrome is broad and includes infection (cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis), neurologic (deep peroneal nerve entrapment), toxicology (snake envenomation), vascular (deep vein thrombosis, ischemic necrosis or gangrene, popliteal artery entrapment), trauma (vascular, nerve, muscle, or fascia soft tissue injuries, tibia or fibula fracture), musculoskeletal (chronic exertional compartment syndrome, stress fracture, medial tibial stress syndrome) and rhabdomyolysis.
