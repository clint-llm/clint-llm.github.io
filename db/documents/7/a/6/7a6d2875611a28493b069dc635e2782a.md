Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium), more specifically known as urogenital schistosomiasis, is an endemic disease to many countries in Africa and the Middle East that affects millions of individuals. It causes a range of urogenital issues such as dysuria, hematuria, urinary obstruction, spontaneous abortion, and bladder cancer. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium) and reviews the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of the trematode Schistosoma haematobium and risk factors for infection.
- Summarize the physical exam findings associated with Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium). 
- Identify the common chronic complications of patients with Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium).
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interdisciplinary team in order to treat and identify infected and at-risk individuals in order to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients living in endemic countries affected by Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium).
