Chondroblastoma is ideally managed by an interprofessional team that consists of orthopedists, radiologists, and pathologists. Correlation between gross, radiographic, and microscopic features of the lesion is crucial to establish the definitive diagnosis of chondroblastoma. Postoperatively, patients require long term follow-up due to the possibility of tumor recurrence.
