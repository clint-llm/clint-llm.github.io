There are reports of sympathomimetic syndrome with hyperlactatemia and metabolic acidosis after the intentional inhalation of salmeterol in a suicide attempt. Patients who overdose commonly present with heart palpitation, chest pain, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, lactic acidosis, ST-segment depression, and sinus tachycardia. Patients may also present with angina, hypotension, hypertension, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, and muscle cramps. Overdose with salmeterol can lead to prolongation of the QT interval resulting in ventricular arrhythmias.

The standard treatment for symptomatic salmeterol overdose is supportive and should include intravenous fluids, careful potassium supplementation, a cardioselective beta-blocker, and cardiac monitoring.
