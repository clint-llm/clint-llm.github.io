The red eye is a common complaint in emergency departments and outpatient clinics. One frequent cause is a subconjunctival hemorrhage. Subconjunctival Hemorrhage (SCH) is a disorder that can occur for the most part from benign situations. However, there are certain times when subconjunctival hemorrhages can occur as a manifestation of a more dangerous underlying diagnosis, especially if persistent or recurrent.Â  Subconjunctival Hemorrhage is generally painless but can appear as diffusely hyperemic. Therefore physicians, advanced practice providers, and ophthalmologists can encounter SCH many times throughout their clinical practice. The conjunctiva is divided into two sections. The bulbar conjunctiva covers the sclera and the tarsal conjunctiva covers the inside of the eyelids. The blood from an SCH comes from small blood vessels on the surface of the eye over the sclera and not from the inside of the eye. Blood leaks under Tenon's capsule and the condition becomes more apparent when blood leaks into the externally exposed part of the bulbar conjunctiva. Elderly patients, especially those with underlying vascular disorders such as hypertension and diabetes, are most at risk. Younger patients tend to have more spontaneous or traumatic causes. Nevertheless, SCH usually does not require any specific treatment and should resolve in 1-2 weeks.
