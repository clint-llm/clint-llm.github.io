An interscalene brachial plexus block is a commonly used anesthesia procedure for regional surgery involving the lateral clavicle, shoulder joint, and proximal humerus. The block may be performed in an anterior or posterior approach. The risk of an anterior approach includes an iatrogenic phrenic nerve block. Impacting the phrenic nerve could have significant consequences for the patient with pulmonary compromise.  Thus, patients with a history of severe COPD are often provided an alternative anesthetic modality.

The posterior approach minimizes this risk especially with the use of ultrasound guidance. In studies of the ultrasound-guided procedure, the dorsal scapular nerve is encountered in the vast majority of cases (75%). In addition to the dorsal scapular nerve, the long thoracic nerve is frequently affected as well (21%). Both nerves being impacted simultaneously occurs as well (24%).
