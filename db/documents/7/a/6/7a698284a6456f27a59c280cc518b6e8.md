Patients who are allergic to phenothiazines can develop hypersensitive anaphylactic reactions with chlorpromazine. Such patients can be treated by discontinuing the drug and administering steroids or antihistaminic drugs. Chlorpromazine use also requires caution in patients with cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Patients should start on a low dose of chlorpromazine as an initial dosage, and the increase in subsequent dosing should be gradual. However, treatment should be discontinued if the patient develops agranulocytosis.

In the event of an overdose, ensure adequate ventilation. No specific antidote is available, and treatment primarily addresses symptoms with regular cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Gastric lavage may be attempted if the patient presents to the emergency department within the first 4 to 6 hours. Activated charcoal is also an option. ECGs are necessary to assess for arrhythmias or QT-interval prolongation. NMS should be treated supportively with cooling and by giving dantrolene sodium. Treatment for TD can be done by discontinuing chlorpromazine and starting a second-generation antipsychotic along with valbenazine or deutetrabenazine.
