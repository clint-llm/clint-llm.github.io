**Interpretation of SLRT**

- Pain radiating down the buttock to the lateral thigh and medial calf - L4 nerve root irritation

- Pain radiating down the buttock to the posterior thigh and lateral calf - L5 nerve root irritation

- Pain radiating down the buttock to the posterior thigh and calf, and lateral foot - S1 nerve root irritation

**Interpretation of Positive Reverse SLRT**

- L2, L3, or L4 root irritation

- Femoral nerve irritation

**Sensitivity and Specificity of the Test**

The sensitivity of ipsilateral SLRT is 72 to 97%, and specificity is 11 to 66%, whereas the crossed SLRT  sensitivity is 23 to 42%  which is less than ipsilateral SLRT but more specific (85 to 100%).

**Tests to Confirm Non-organicity While Performing SLRT**

- Pain occurring at an angle less than 30 degrees

- A significant discrepancy between the supine and sitting SLRT

- Touch-me-not or Waddell sign - Widespread and excessive tenderness

- Back pain on pressing down on the top of the head

- Overreaction during testing

- Non-dermatomal and non-myotomal neurologic signs

- Pain during simulated spinal rotation: The patient’s hands remain to the sides with hips rotated. There will not be any spine rotation with this maneuver. But the patient will complain of pain.
