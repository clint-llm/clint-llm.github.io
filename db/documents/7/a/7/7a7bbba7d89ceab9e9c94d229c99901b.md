Odontoid fractures most often occur as a result of trauma to the cervical spine. Patients are often younger. The clinicians must work together in a coordinated interprofessional team approach to care that minimizes the risk of further injury. Trauma nurses are responsible for cervical spine immobilization—radiologists review X-rays and scans. Neurosurgeons and orthopedists provide definitive care. Physiatrists and rehabilitation nurses coordinate care and feedback to the interprofessional team. Often pharmacist assists the team in helping to maintain pain control in the acutely injured patient. Nurses can serve as the liaison point between the various disciplines, assist in patient assessment and during surgery, monitor patients, and answer patient questions. All care team members must maintain accurate and updated patient records so that every team member is operating from the same information. This interprofessional team approach will lead to improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
