Olecranon fractures typically involve the articular surface of the elbow.  Posttraumatic arthritis occurs in approximately 20% of cases and persistent malreduction >2mm of the articular surface is associated with this outcome

The triceps muscle (innervated by the radial n) inserts onto the olecranon, blending with the periosteum. A displaced fracture interrupts the extensor mechanism resulting in loss of active elbow extension. The pull from the triceps is the key deforming force, pulling the separated fragment superiorly. Greater displacement suggests tearing of the fibrous sheath over the olecranon.

The olecranon confers stability to the elbow joint, acting as a block to the anterior translation of the ulna in relation to the distal humerus.  Olecranon fractures can have associated with ligamentous injury (the medial and lateral collateral ligaments stabilize against valgus and varus stress respectively), coronoid process, and radial head fractures.  Unstable injuries require reduction and stable fixation of the olecranon to restore elbow stability.

The ulnar nerve lies on the medial aspect, posterior to the medial collateral ligament before crossing anteriorly to run alongside the ulnar artery. Awareness of these structures is key when operating in this region.
