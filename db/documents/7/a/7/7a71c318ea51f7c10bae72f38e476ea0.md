N. gonorrhoeae infection starts with the adhesion of gonococci to epithelial cells, followed by local cellular invasion. Gonorrhea has multiple surface proteins that facilitate adhesion. N. gonorrhoeae utilize pili to initiate adhesion to epithelial cells. Hair-like appendages, pili, cover the bacterial surface. Their ability to lengthen and retract allows the bacteria to attach from a distance and move closer to the epithelial cells, promoting cellular invasion. Pili also provide motility and protection.

Invasion of cervical epithelium involves bacterial cells interacting with host cell complement receptors type 3 (CR3). This communication is initiated by the binding of pili to the CR3.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae induces localized infection at the anatomic site of inoculation, typically the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or anus in adults and the eye conjunctiva or the pharynx of newborns, but dissemination can occur.N. gonorrhoeae has evolved multiple mechanisms to combat the innate and adaptive immunity systems of their host organismsâ€™ immune defenses.
