The differential diagnosis for patients presenting with shoulder pain can include, but is not limited to, the following conditions:

**Trauma**

- **Acute versus chronic fractures and/or associated complications**
- detailed further assessed following a thorough history-taking in which prior injuries, fractures, and surgeries are documented
- chronic conditions include malunion/nonunion with persistent disability, pain, and shoulder dysfunction

**Impingement**

- External/SIS

- Subcoracoid

- Calcific tendonitis

- Internal (including SLAP lesions, glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD), Little league shoulder, posterior labral tears)

**RC pathology**

- Partial- versus full-thickness tears (PTTs versus FTTs)

- RCA

**Degenerative**

- Advanced DJD, often associated with RCA

- Glenohumeral arthritis

- Adhesive capsulitis

- Avascular necrosis (AVN)

- Scapulothoracic crepitus

**Proximal biceps**

- Subluxation – often seen in association with SubSc injuries

- Tendonitis and tendinopathy

**AC joint conditions**

- AC separation

- Distal clavicle osteolysis

- AC arthritis

**Instability**

- Unidirectional instability – seen in association with an inciting event/dislocation (anterior, posterior, inferior)

- Multidirectional instability (MDI)

- Associated labral injuries/pathology

**Neurovascular conditions**

- Suprascapular neuropathy – can be associated with paralabral cyst at the spinoglenoid notch

- Scapular winging – medial or lateral

- Brachial neuritis

- Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)

- Quadrilateral space syndrome

**Other conditions**

- Scapulothoracic dyskinesia

- Os acromiale

- Muscle ruptures (pectoralis major, deltoid, latissimus dorsi)
