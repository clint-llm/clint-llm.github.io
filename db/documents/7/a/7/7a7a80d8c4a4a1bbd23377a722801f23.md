- Bacterial infection with high fever

- Bone fractures

- Certain stages of carcinomas (some contradict this)

- Thrombotic events

- Lymphoma

- Leukemia

Relative contraindications for some techniques:

- Thoracic and pedal pumps

- Osteoporosis
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Recent abdominal surgery

- Splenic/liver pump

- Acute hepatitis
- Friable liver
- Traumatic injury to either organ

- Doming the diaphragm

- A full stomach
