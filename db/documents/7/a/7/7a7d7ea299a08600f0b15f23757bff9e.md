The first vein of the face and neck that arises during embryological development is the ventral pharyngeal vein. This vein drains into the common cardinal vein. The primitive maxillary vein is located superolateral to the ventral pharyngeal vein and forms an anastomosis with the linguofacial vein. The resulting vein formed is the anterior facial vein. Upon further development of the embryo, the external jugular vein manifests from neck tissue and creates an anastomosis with the anterior facial vein. As development progresses, the external jugular vein will connect anteriorly with the facial vein and posteriorly with the retromandibular vein.
