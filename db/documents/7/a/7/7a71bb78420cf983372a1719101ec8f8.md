HBSE in clinical practice and application can be best described using a case example. Consider a 40-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease status-post 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 3 months ago, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder, who presents for an evaluation of brittle diabetes. He recently lost his job and is going through a divorce, and he is currently living on his own. Utilizing any of the above theories, we can identify quickly that the information we have thus far only constitutes a basic level of understanding of this presenting individual.

As an example, we can use the Micro-Mezzo-Macro approach. We can identify that thus far, we understand some biological and psychological factors contributing to his presentation (the Micro factors). These include the medical and psychiatric disorders listed. On further analysis of each of these disorders alone, one can begin to formulate hypotheses about some initial contributors to the patient's labile blood sugars. Some hypotheses might include considering the patient's mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness and how this may impact his adherence to medical treatment, which we could further assess. Also, one might consider that the patient is experiencing ongoing psychological and/or physiological effects of his CABG, which is making it difficult to exercise, contributing to more difficult control of blood sugars. Other considerations might be whether treatment interactions are affecting his insulin resistance or response to medications. We may also consider that his cognition may be affected on some level and contribute to his inability to remember to take his medications.

One can also see that mezzo and macro-level contributors are less clear based on the initial information. We may need to explore these factors further to understand how they may contribute to this patient's presentation. We see that he has recently lost his job, and one can formulate a hypothesis that he may have some financial strain as a result, and he may also have lost his insurance coverage. Both of these could make affording medications or visits with providers unfeasible. We also understand that he is living on his own. He may have limited social support to take care of himself and his needs, which could be various and may also affect his perception of the importance of treatment adherence. The divorce process may also contribute to financial strain and interpersonal difficulties, making it more difficult for him to trust or interact with others, including his providers. It may also be worsening his depressive or anxiety-related symptoms as above as well as his diet. Another consideration could include that his job loss occurred in the setting of a worsening economy, or as a result of deteriorating interpersonal relations at his work, his decreasing perception of his self-importance and self-worth, among others. We may also consider that losing his job could mean that he has lost a significant portion of his social support network.

Other contributors might include the availability of green spaces near him, neighborhood safety, nearby community organizations that could support him, legislation affecting the patient's housing or job security, or healthcare policies or changes. Additionally, concepts such as discrimination and prejudice and the impact of race on this individual can inform adherence, trust in healthcare providers, and an understanding of potential significant life stressors contributing to the patient's presentation. As we continue to consider aspects of this individual's presentation, we can see that there may be multiple other factors contributing to his presenting complaint. Psychosocial factors, as described above, have been reported in the literature to have a significant impact on healthcare outcomes in a variety of studies.
