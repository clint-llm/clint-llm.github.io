Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) affects the juxtalimbal cornea and classically presents with epithelial defect and stromal lysis. This inflammatory condition results in a complex interplay between host autoimmunity, the anatomy and physiology of the peripheral cornea, and the environment. The underlying cause could be local or systemic, infectious or noninfectious. PUK can be due to vasculitides and collagen vascular disease; rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can account for up to 53% of PUK cases.

PUK without systemic association is known as Mooren's ulcer (MU) and contributes to 31.5% of PUK causes.

PUK is important to diagnose as it can be the first presenting feature of a life-threatening systemic disease.Â Meticulous clinical investigation and multi-disciplinary management are required to ensure safe patient outcomes.
