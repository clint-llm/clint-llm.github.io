The latest knowledge about the pathophysiology of obesity stems from the discovery of hormones and pathways important in appetite and weight regulation. Lifestyle modification is the first step in weight management. Lifestyle modification consists of a healthy diet, exercise, ensuring sleep quality, and stress mitigation. Up to now, dietary guidelines have been updated multiple times based on available scientific evidence. In popular culture, there are dozens of different diets targeted towards weight loss. Unfortunately, the general population leans towards a quick fix and rapid results, which is not necessarily sustainable in the long term. In addition, some of these diets may focus on weight loss and ignore overall health promotion.

One kilogram of fat contains 9000 kilocalories. To lose half a kilogram of fat per week, a person should achieve a 4500 kcal net deficit for a week, 642 kcal in one day. Net energy deficit is achieved by decreasing food intake (dieting) and increasing physical activity. For example, a 55-year old moderately active 136 kg woman needs 2600 kcal for her daily needs. For a person who consumes a 2600 kcal diet, creating a 642 kcal deficit will require a 25 percent reduction in daily energy intake if the individual does not increase physical activity. The patient needs to spend effort, time, and usually some extra money to reach the goal of losing 26 kg of fat in a year. The effort can be too much, and the time to achieve the target weight is too long for some individuals. Reaching ideal body weight might seem too slow for some individuals triggering giving up on lifestyle treatment. It is advisable to set realistic goals that can be achievable.

There is no single diet that can universally fit everyone for weight loss benefit. The initial dietary approach was based on achieving energy deficit by varying macronutrient composition. Unfortunately, the "calorie in calorie out "concept of weight regulation oversimplifies the physiologic process of appetite and weight regulation.
