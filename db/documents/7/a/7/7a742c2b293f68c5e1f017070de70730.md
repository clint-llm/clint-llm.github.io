TEE is often performed by the cardiologist to assess the heart structures. It is more sensitive than a transthoracic procedure. However, it is important to have the nurse monitor the patient during the procedure. A relatively common complication of the procedure is perforation of the esophagus and hence a chest X-ray should be obtained after the procedure. If the tear is small, then the chest x-ray may be normal but symptoms may appear within 24-48 hours.
