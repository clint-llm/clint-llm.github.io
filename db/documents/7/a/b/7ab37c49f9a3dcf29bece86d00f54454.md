Human beings are creatures that are primarily composed of water. It is the essence of life and the aqueous base solution in which all essential biochemical processes occur that produce life. Humans are approximately 75% water by mass as infants and 50% to 60% water by mass as adults. Furthermore, fluid is always in flux through a variety of regulatory mechanisms to maintain appropriate concentrations throughout the various compartments of the body. Fluid is largely regulated through passive diffusion following the concentration gradients of osmotically active solutes; however, hydrostatic pressures can influence fluid movement between spaces.
