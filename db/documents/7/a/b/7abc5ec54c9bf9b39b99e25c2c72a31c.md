Diagnosis and management of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can be challenging as presenting symptoms and signs of dyspnea and hypoxemia can be observed in a myriad of conditions, mainly of the cardiac and pulmonary systems. This condition is best managed with an interprofessional team approach. While the diagnosis can be made by a primary care provider, internist, or pulmonologist, referral for management almost always involves evaluation by an interventional radiologist. In cases where the defect is not amenable for embolization, patients should be referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon for further evaluation.

Nurses are of vital importance in the interprofessional team as they will be in charge of evaluating the patient and closely monitoring vital signs and patient symptoms. Patients should also be screened for HHT and, if diagnosed with the condition, should also be referred to other specialists depending on other factors, including the degree of anemia or the anatomic locations of other AVMs.
