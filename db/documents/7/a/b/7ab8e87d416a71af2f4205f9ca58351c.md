Children make up roughly 80% of patients presenting to emergency departments with an esophageal foreign body.

Similarly, in adults, similar accidental foreign body ingestions occur; however, the most common cause of impaction in adults is a food (mostly meat) bolus. The estimated annual incidence of food impaction is 13.0 per 100,000. Eighty percent to 90% occur in the distal esophagus associated with anatomic or motor abnormalities. These abnormalities include diverticula, webs, rings, strictures, tumors, eosinophilic esophagitis, achalasia, scleroderma, or esophageal spasms. For this reason, it is recommended that adults with a history of food impaction, even if it resolves spontaneously, need follow-up evaluation of the esophagus.
