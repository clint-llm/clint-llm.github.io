The function of Virchow's triad is to demonstrate the underlying physiology that drives the formation of a thrombus. Clots within the vasculature place the patient at risk for thromboembolic events such as CVA, pulmonary arterial embolus or organ infarction, ischemia, and cell death. Understanding physiology enables clinicians to understand better the risk factors for developing deep vein thrombosis.

**Thrombogenesis in Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**

The simultaneous presence of venous stasis, hypercoagulability and vascular injury increases the risk for clot formation, as described in Virchow's triad. Venous thrombosis tends to occur in areas with decreased or mechanically altered blood flow, such as the pockets adjacent to valves in the leg's deep veins.

A venous thrombus has two components, an inner platelet-rich white thrombus forming the so-called lines of Zahn surrounded by an outer red cell dense fibrin clot. Fibrin and extracellular DNA complexed with histone proteins forms the outer scaffold, which may be important in determining thrombus susceptibility to tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and thrombolysis.

In addition to promoting thrombin generation, prothrombin inhibits the anticoagulant properties of activated protein C, thereby dampening a natural anticoagulant pathway. There are three pathways: the protein C anticoagulant pathway (protein C, protein S, thrombomodulin, and perhaps EPCR), the heparin-antithrombin pathway, and the tissue factor inhibitor pathway. Defects in these pathways are associated with an increased risk for thrombus formation. In humans, less is known regarding the role of the tissue factor inhibitor pathway.

Several familial variants predispose to thrombus formation by increasing the levels of factors VII, VIII, IX, von Willebrand factor, and prothrombin. Other risk factors for clot formation include cancer, oral contraceptives, obesity, and advancing age. Malignancy can exert a compressive effect on veins contributing to stasis. It also leads to shedding procoagulants, such as tissue factor on membrane particles that promotes thrombosis.

Finally, advancing age is associated with an increased risk for thrombosis. While the cause for this remains unsettled, several factors related to aging have been observed: greater prevalence of obesity, increased frequency of illness and periods of prolonged immobility, comorbid medical conditions, and an increase in the level of procoagulants without a commensurate increase in anticoagulants such as protein C.

**Thrombogenesis in Pregnancy**

- Progesterone causes systemic venous dilation.

During pregnancy, the blood becomes hypercoagulable with increases in pro-coagulation factors V, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XII and von Willebrand factor.

**Thrombogenesis in Atrial Fibrillation**

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia associated with a high risk of stroke and thromboembolism.

**Thrombogenesis in LV Thrombus Post-MI**

The mechanism involving LV thrombus formation following AMI involves the principle of Virchow's triad. Mechanically, infarct expansion with regional thinning and dilation of the damaged endothelium in the infarct zone begins almost immediately, increases wall stress, and may lead to ventricular aneurysm formation.

Larger infarcts, evidenced by higher levels of cardiac enzymes, have also been associated with increased rates of LV thrombus formation compared with patients with smaller infarcts. Baseline C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio are independent predictors of early LV thrombus formation after AMI. In this context, the propagation and growth of small thrombi into larger thrombi protruding into the ventricular cavity and exposed to circulating blood flow may lead to embolism.
