Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine is used alone or sometimes mixed with bupivacaine 0.25% in equal parts and injected deeply across the entire forehead. In addition, the dorsum of the nose and the base of the flap are injected. The margins of the nasal defect are debrided as necessary and made perpendicular to the wound bed with a scalpel, removing the remainder of the affected aesthetic subunit, if appropriate.

**Flap Elevation and Inset**

The flap is designed to incorporate the supratrochlear vessels within its base and pedicle using a combination of the surface landmarks described above and Doppler ultrasonography, if necessary. A wound template is made, often using the foil of a suture packet to shape the skin paddle at the distal end of the flap in the superior forehead. For patients with low anterior hairlines or those for whom the flap will be used in columellar reconstruction, the flap may be designed with a lateral curve to avoid the utilization of hair-bearing skin. If the flap extends into the hair-bearing scalp, dissection in a subcutaneous plane is often utilized to expose terminal hair bulbs and remove them. If the defect is large, elevation in a subcutaneous plane can be advantageous as well because it will expedite healing by secondary intention, as compared to a donor site wound that extends down to the galea or periosteum. On the other hand, if the defect is deep, elevating the flap in a submuscular/subgaleal plane will provide more bulk to the reconstruction.

In some cases, the flap may even be raised in continuity with a split-thickness calvarium if structural support is needed. The pedicle is typically elevated in a submuscular/subgaleal plane, in a strip approximately 1.5 to 2 cm wide, centered on the supratrochlear vessels. If the pedicle is too narrow, there is a risk of failing to include the supratrochlear vessels in their entirety, but if the pedicle is too wide, the risk of kinking it during rotation and compromising perfusion or venous drainage increases. For flap design purposes, the length of the pedicle may be estimated using a surgical sponge held fast at the medial eyebrow and rotating it down to the defect, which will give the surgeon an idea of how much length will be lost during the 180-degree flap rotation. In general, basing the flap contralateral to the larger part of the defect (if the defect is not perfectly midline and symmetric) will decrease the likelihood of kinking the pedicle and minimize the chances of flap compromise due to venous congestion or arterial insufficiency.

The plane of elevation deepens to a subperiosteal plane approximately 3 cm above the orbital rim to ensure the supratrochlear vessels, which are running deep to the frontalis muscle at this point, are incorporated into the flap. Careful undermining with direct visualization should take place if dissecting inferiorly beyond the orbital rim to improve flap length or mobility, as the supraorbital artery is also at risk of transection in this location. Once the flap is elevated, the nasal skin is undermined around the periphery of the defect, and the flap is rotated into place. Prior to suturing, the flap's thickness should be evaluated and adjusted as necessary to fit the defect.

At this point, if the defect extends close to the margin of the nasal ala, a rim graft of harvested septal or auricular cartilage may be placed to decrease the risk of postoperative alar notching. The flap is then sutured into place within the defect, taking care to evert the wound edges. Abutting the nasal dorsum, the proximal aspect of the flap is not sutured until pedicle division at a later date. Lastly, the donor site of the forehead is closed with submuscular/subgaleal undermining and multilayer suturing. The goal is to decrease tension and avoid forcing the donor site closed in order to prevent a widened scar and/or a postoperative headache. If part of the wound is closed via secondary intention, scar revision may be necessary at a later date.

Optionally, some surgeons place a skin graft on the exposed submuscular/subgaleal surface of the pedicle to promote hemostasis and prevent the patient from enduring three weeks of drainage. If a skin graft is not placed, petrolatum gauze may be wrapped around the pedicle instead.

**Intermediate Stage**

After three weeks, the skin flap may be gently elevated out of the defect and further thinned to improve contour.

**Pedicle Division**

The final stage of reconstruction is performed three weeks later. During this stage, the pedicle of the flap is divided, and unused portions are amputated and discarded, except for a triangle of skin that is used to restore the medial aspect of the eyebrow from which the flap was harvested. Meticulous repositioning of the base of the pedicle into the eyebrow is critical for optimizing the procedure's aesthetic outcome. It is essential to ensure that the triangle of the flap's base should not extend above the level of the eyebrow when it is inset back into the glabella; otherwise, it will look like a peninsula within the forehead. To prevent a trapdoor deformity, the brow is closed after wide-undermining and suturing.

**Final Revisions**

Further interventions should be deferred for several months to allow for the evolution of scarring, contraction, and maturity of the flap. Dermabrasion, contouring, and depilation may be performed at a later date.
