Patients should be adequately informed about the AST and its indications, patient requirements, and its clinical use for patient management.  Healthcare providers such as physicians, laboratory personnel, nurses, and pharmacologists are encouraged to disseminate correct information about the test.  However, interpretation of the AST results must take place between the patient and the physician to facilitate good compliance with the prescribed medications and to prevent self-medication. With the rise of antimicrobial resistance, the importance of AST requires an emphasis on medical, laboratory, and nursing staff, as well as patients and their family members, and the whole community leading to a unified approach.
