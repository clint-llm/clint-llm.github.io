The quadrangular (or quadrilateral) space (QS) is named based on the shape of its anatomic boundaries.  Located along the posterolateral shoulder, the QS serves as a passageway for the axillary nerve and posterior humeral circumflex artery (PHCA).  Quadrangular (or quadrilateral) space syndrome (QSS) can occur secondary to various compressive pathologies.  Although the incidence of such pathologies is rare, QSS has a known predilection for subgroups of athletic populations and can often suffer misdiagnosis or are clinically under-appreciated.  Thus, clinicians should maintain a heightened clinical suspicion for QSS in patients aged 20-40 years of age presenting with a history of current contact or overhead athletic performance (e.g., baseball pitchers, swimmers, etc.),
