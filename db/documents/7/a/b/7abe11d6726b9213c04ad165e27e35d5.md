- Renal function should be checked before starting ramipril. If there is a significant drop in the eGFR after initiation of ramipril, then the drug should be stopped, and alternative medications should be used.

- The monitoring of signs of postural hypotension, angioedema, and hyperkalemia is recommended, especially during the initial few weeks.

- If the patient has a history of collagen vascular disease or chronic kidney disease, CBC with differentials should be monitored periodically due to the risk of agranulocytosis.
