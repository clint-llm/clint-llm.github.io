The etiology of formation is uncertain, but arachnoid cysts, in theory, are predominantly formed due to abnormal splitting during embryogenesis of the arachnoid. IfÂ histopathology shows the presence of inflammatory cells, excess collagen, or hemosiderin staining, then an inflammatory or traumatic etiology is suggested. Underlying gliosis is not usually found in the adjacent brain secondary to mass effect. Some syndromes have been associated with arachnoid cysts, and these syndromes include Aicardi syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis, acrocallosal syndrome, Marfan syndrome, a missense mutation (c.2576C>T) in the arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats gene (RERE), and Chudley-Mullough syndrome.
