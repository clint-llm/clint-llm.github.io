The risorius muscle is innervated, like all muscles of facial expression, by the facial nerve, to which it is directly connected. There is debate over which branch of the facial nerve actually innervates the risorius, but most agree that it is either one of the buccal branches or the marginal mandibular branch, and it may receive motor innervation from both. The buccal branches of the facial nerve arise from the facial nerve deep to the parotid gland and just posterior to the superficial and deep masseter muscles upon which it sits and has branches that flank the risorius muscle on its superior and inferior aspects. The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve is a tributary from the facial nerve just distal to the most distal buccal branch, and courses down the angle of the jaw and along the posterior aspect of the mandible. Sensory innervation of the cheek come from the buccal nerve, a branch of the anterior division of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve via general somatic afferent fibers.
