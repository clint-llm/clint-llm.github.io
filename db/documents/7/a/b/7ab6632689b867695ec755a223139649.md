Any intrinsic or extrinsic compression anywhere along the optic nerve can produce compressive optic neuropathy (CON). Other than damage by compression, optic nerve damage can occur as a result of demyelination, ischemia, metabolic, and traumatic insult.

The optic nerve has over 1 million nerve fibers.

The optic nerve begins in the lamina cribrosa of the sclera and exits the orbit through the optic canal. As it leaves the orbit, it is engulfed with an extension of the cranial dura and subarachnoid layer, which forms the optic nerve sheath. The axons of the ganglion cells project as the optic nerve and decussate in the optic chiasm and continue as the optic tract which courses to the lateral geniculate ganglion, which then projects to the primary visual cortex as the optic radiations. The optic nerve averages 50 mm in length (1 mm intraocular segment, 25 mm intraorbital segment, 9 mm intracanalicular segment, and 16 mm intracranial segment).
