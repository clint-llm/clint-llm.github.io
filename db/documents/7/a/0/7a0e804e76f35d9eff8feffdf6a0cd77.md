There are several potential adverse effects of promethazine administration related to its mechanism of action. The most common side effects include sedation, confusion, and disorientation, which may impair physical and mental abilities. However, in some cases, promethazine may paradoxically cause excitability, restlessness, or rare seizures.

Promethazine’s anticholinergic properties may cause side effects, including blurred vision, xerostomia, dry nasal passages, dilated pupils, constipation, and urinary retention. Due to these effects, the American Geriatrics Society categorizes promethazine as a potentially inappropriate drug for the elderly.

Promethazine’s antidopaminergic properties may result in extrapyramidal symptoms, including pseuodoparkinsonism, acute dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. Promethazine, therefore, may worsen symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease.

Less common adverse effects that prescribers should be aware of include:

- The neuroleptic malignant syndrome may also have associations with promethazine usage, which manifests as increased body temperature, confusion or altered mental status, sweating, autonomic instability, and “lead pipe” rigidity.

- Cardiovascular side effects include arrhythmias and hypotension.

- Reports also exist of liver damage and cholestatic jaundice with its use.

- Bone marrow suppression, potentially resulting in agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.

- Depression of the thermoregulatory mechanism resulting in hypothermia/hyperthermia.

**Black Box Warnings**

- In children less than two years old, reports exist of respiratory depression resulting in fatalities.

- Promethazine may cause serious tissue injury on injection, including gangrene, regardless of the route of administration. This effect may occur due to extravasation, unintentional intra-arterial administration, and intraneuronal or perineuronal infiltration, manifesting as burning, pain, erythema, edema, severe spasms, phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis, sensory loss, paralysis, and palsies.
