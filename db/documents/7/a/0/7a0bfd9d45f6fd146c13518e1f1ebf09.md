Complications of severe chronic aortic regurgitation include progressive LV dysfunction and dilation that can lead to progressive, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The presence of symptomatic aortic regurgitation portends a higher risk of complications, as well as the presence of echocardiographic findings of reduced LV ejection fraction and worsening LV end-systolic dimension. This highlights the importance of monitoring patients with aortic regurgitation to prevent adverse outcomes.
