The incidence of lymphoma in the United States from 2009 to 2013 was 22/ 100,000, representing approximately 5% of malignancies, it doubled in the time period 1970-1990, and it has been stable since. The median age of diagnosis is 63. Overall survival is estimated to be 72% at five years, and it is improving.

Lymphomas are broadly classified into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 10% and Non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 90%.

HL is further classified into classical and non-classical types and NHL into B- cell, T- cell and natural killer (NK) cell types.

For clinical purposes, lymphoma is termed as aggressive (high grade) and indolent (low grade).

Below is the revised 2016 revised WHO classification of lymphomas.
