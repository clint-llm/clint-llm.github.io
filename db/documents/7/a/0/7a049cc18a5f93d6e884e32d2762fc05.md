The early 1950s saw the widespread use of mechanical ventilators with endotracheal tubes with a low-volume, high-pressure cuff. Prolonged intubation, high cuff pressures, and excessive movement of the tracheostomy tube were found to cause ischemic injury and necrosis, leading to circumferential tracheal scarring and narrowing.

Since that time, there have been significant advancements in airway management during tracheal resection and surgical maneuvers to reduce tension for anastomosis. Â Tracheal resection with primary anastomosis is presently a surgical procedure performed in major tertiary centers, managed by a multidisciplinary team of anesthesiologists, otolaryngologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, and pulmonary and critical care intensivists. Originally meant as a solution to tracheal stenosis, tracheal resection is now used to treat tracheal tumors, tracheomalacia, tracheal trauma, and tracheoesophageal and tracheoinnominate fistulas.
