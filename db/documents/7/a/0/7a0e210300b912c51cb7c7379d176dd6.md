- Immediately post-operatively the patient's foot and ankle should be placed into an extremely well-padded posterior splint.

- Drains are typically removed on postoperative day 2 or even earlier based on surgeon preference.

- The patient should be adequately educated on the need to elevate the extremity for the first several weeks after surgery to reduce swelling and the subsequent risk of wound complications.

- The splint may be removed as early as 2-5 days based on some recommendations or left in place for 2 weeks in some cases, but after removing the splint the patient should begin his or her range of motion exercises for the subtalar joint and ankle joint as soon as possible.

- Weight-bearing is often delayed 8-12 weeks (or more depending on the degree of comminution and progression of healing on radiographs).

- Routine serial radiographs should be obtained to ensure the progression of healing.
