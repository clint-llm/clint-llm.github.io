Fasting is performed clinically when blood tests require minimal caloric intake to aid in the diagnosis of various diseases. Fasting blood glucose is an example of a test that helps to aid in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus based on a set threshold that determines if a patientâ€™s insulin receptors are functioning properly by their ability to lower blood glucose in response to insulin. In cases of diabetes mellitus type 2, insulin resistance results in high fasting blood glucose. Additionally, high fasting blood glucose has been studied as a risk factor for the development of high blood pressure.

Another test that traditionally requires a patient to be fasting for accuracy includes triglyceride measurement on a lipid panel. Blood triglycerides are present in substantial quantity in the carrier proteins chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Chylomicrons are responsible for carrying triglycerides from digested food to peripheral tissues while VLDL is made in the liver and represents a baseline blood triglyceride level resilient to food intake. Therefore, an accurate measurement of blood triglycerides in VLDL requires a patient to be fasting to exclude chylomicron triglycerides from the measurement. Recent data suggest that accurate lipid measurement may be possible in the absence of fasting although fasting for lipid panels is still recommended by most national and international guidelines.
