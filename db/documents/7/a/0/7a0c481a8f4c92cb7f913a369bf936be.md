**Therapeutic Index and Toxic Doses**

Therapeutic drug levels for aspirin areÂ 150 to 300 mcg/mL (salicylate).

Toxic Levels: Greater than 300 mcg/mL

Timing: 1 to 3 hours after the dose

Time to Steady State: 5 to 7 days

Plasma levels of aspirin can range from 3 to 10 mg/dL for therapeutic doses to as high as 70 to 140 mg/dL for acute toxicity. Due to delayed absorption of certain preparations, levels should be checked 4 hours after consumption and every subsequent 2 hours until maximum levels are reached.

Treatment needs to be individualized based on symptomatology as well as levels.

Aspirin levels do not need to be monitored in most cases. For certain diseases, serum creatinine at baseline, along with serum drug levels if patients have adult or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease, or arthritis/pleurisy.
