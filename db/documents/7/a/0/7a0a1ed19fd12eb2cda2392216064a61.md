Many known triggers have been linked to pemphigus, but drugs continue to be the most prevalent cause of the disease. The inciting medications can be classified based on their chemical structure, with the main groups being thiols drugs, phenol drugs, and non-thiol/phenol drugs. Thiol drugs contain a sulfhydryl (-SH) group in their chemical structure and have been known to be the most common cause of pemphigus. Some of the most noteworthy thiols reported as triggering pemphigus are penicillamine, captopril, and tiopronine. The literature suggests thiol drugs promote acantholysis by stimulating enzymes like plasminogen activator, which disaggregate keratinocytes and inhibiting enzymes that promote keratinocyte aggregation.

Phenol drugs disrupt the integrity of cellular adherence mechanisms by stimulating keratinocytes to release proinflammatory cytokines. The release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 from cells drive complement and protease activation, which contribute to acantholysis. The most noteworthy phenols include aspirin, heroin, rifampin, and levodopa.

Many non-thiol and non-phenol drugs have also been classically described in pemphigus. These agents may cause acantholysis through alternative pathways such as the activation of autoantibodies or altering the target antigen structure on keratinocytes. Examples of these agents include non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drugs, and calcium-channel blockers.
