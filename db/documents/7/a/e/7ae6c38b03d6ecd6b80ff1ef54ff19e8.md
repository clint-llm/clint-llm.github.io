Imaging with PET/CT requires careful patient preparation. Poor glycaemic control, incomplete fasting, and insulin injection just before the scan can affect the biodistribution of radiotracer as glucose in the blood can compete with FDG on the GLUT-1 transporters, and a high level of insulin can divert a substantial amount of FDG to the skeletal muscles and adipose tissue through insulin-dependent GLUT-4 transporters.

Ideally, PET/CT should not be performed until at least >6 weeks after radiotherapy or surgery and >2 weeks after stent placement to avoid inflammatory uptake at the intervention site, potentially overestimating the disease.

Patients with claustrophobia may require sedation. PET/CT is generally unsuitable for pregnant patients, and alternate means of evaluating disease should be arranged.

Breastfeeding mothers should avoid contact with the infant after the scan, and the general recommendation is to bottle feed the infant by a third person for up to 12 hours after the scan.
