Since SPS is not selective for potassium ions, other electrolyte imbalances may occur while using SPS in hyperkalemic patients. Patients should be monitored carefully for the signs and symptoms of other electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia,Â  hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. Hypokalemia may be associated with cardiac arrhythmias and severe muscle weakness. Hypokalemia may be evident as prolongation of the QT interval, T-wave inversions, prominent U waves (an extra upward wave after the T-wave) in Electrocardiogram (ECG). Some patients may present with significant symptoms of rebound hyperkalemia, which may be evident in ECG as a tall peaked T wave.

Hypomagnesemia can present with muscle weakness and potentiate hypokalemia. Hypocalcemia presents with tremors, muscle weakness, tetany, and rarely, seizures.
