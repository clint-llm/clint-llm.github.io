Cardiovascular disease is the utmost important predisposing risk factor for the most common cause of WCT. Therefore, to effectively combat and prevent VT, one should reduce the risk of developing any form of heart disease by adopting healthier lifestyle modifications. These include exercise regularly, a healthy diet, weight loss, manage stress appropriately, smoking cessation, limit alcohol intake, and avoid illicit drug use (i.e., cocaine). For those who already have a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, the best way to prevent VT is to follow up regularly with your primary care doctor, take your medications as instructed, monitor your blood pressure, keep glucose and cholesterol levels under control, and adopt lifestyle modifications. Although it occurs infrequently, there is a form of VT (i.e., idiopathic VT) that can result from someone without any prior history of heart disease.
