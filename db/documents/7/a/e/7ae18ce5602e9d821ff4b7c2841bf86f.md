The normal posterior tibial tendon should be comprised of linear collagen bundles, normal fibroblast cellularity, and low proportion of vascular density. In posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, the tendon undergoes microtrauma and subsequent tendinitis characterized by increased mucin contentment, neovascularization, and fibroblast hypercellularity.
