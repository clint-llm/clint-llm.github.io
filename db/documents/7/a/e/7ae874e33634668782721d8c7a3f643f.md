Endemic to the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, strongyloidiasis mainly affects tropical and sub-tropical regions. It is estimated that S. stercoralis affects 30 to 100 million people worldwide. It is often underdiagnosed, and more appropriate and sensitive diagnostic tests would yield a higher global incidence.

Environmental risk factors in endemic regions include close exposure to soil and sand for occupational needs, proximity to farm animals, overcrowding, and poor sanitation. A low socio-economic population is, therefore, more vulnerable. For the same reason, children are affected more due to poor adherence to personal hygiene. The male sex is infected twice as more due to occupational exposure. Certain soil-grown vegetables and even tap water have been identified with S. stercoralis larvae, eggs, and even adult nematodes. While prevalent in all continents, in the United States, the parasite has been particularly identified in Appalachia and the southeastern United States.[8]
