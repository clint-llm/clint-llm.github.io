Overdose can lead to increased antimuscarinic side effects of dilated pupils, warm, dry skin, tachycardia, tremor, ataxia, delirium, and coma. In extreme toxicity, circulatory collapse secondary to respiratory failure may occur after paralysis and coma. Ten milligrams or less may be fatal to a child, while there is no known adult lethal dose.

All Datura plant species have endogenous atropine and other assorted anticholinergic alkaloids. These include Jimson weed and angelâ€™s trumpet, typically seen in warm or temperate climate areas. It may be accidental ingestion or intentionally smoked or ingested for the goal effect of hallucinations. While treatment for ingestions is similar to other toxic overdoses of anticholinergics, whole-bowel irrigation is recommended after a large quantity of seed ingestion. Clinicians need to avoid using phenothiazines in these patients. Physostigmine is the basis of reversal.

Treatment of overdose includes a short-acting barbiturate or diazepam as needed for convulsions or excitement. Avoid dosing for sedation as it can cause respiratory collapse. Physostigmine is useful as an antidote to treat delirium and coma. Repeat doses may be required as physostigmine has a shorter half-life. Monitor respiratory effort and supplement, if necessary.
