There are relatively few contraindications to liver biopsy.

**Absolute Contraindications**

Uncooperative patient: Patients should be counseled thoroughly about the procedure and informed consent taken. Uncooperative patients can increase the risk of complications. If a liver biopsy is required, it can be done under anesthesia.

Increased risk of bleeding: In general liver biopsy is not attempted if INR greater than 1.5 or platelet count is less than 60,000. Such patients may require correction of abnormal parameters before attempting biopsy.

Vascular tumors of the liver: Liver biopsy is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in presumed vascular tumors.

**RelativeÂ Contraindications**

Ascites: Percutaneous biopsy is difficult and associated with increased risk of complications in the setting of ascites. The transvenous route is preferred.

Morbid obesity: The procedure is much more challenging in morbidly obese patients due to interference by adipose tissue. The transvenous route is preferred.
