More and more women have labor induced, and indications are often not urgent. This means that the safety aspects of induction methods become more important, although this could be at the expense of effectiveness. Mechanical methods could have advantages over pharmacological methods as they are widely available, low in cost, and may have fewer side effects, such as excessive uterine contractions (uterine hyperstimulation). This could potentially be safer for the baby because if contractions are too long or very close together, the baby may not receive sufficient oxygen. Pharmacological induction can cause uterine tachysystole, with more than five contractions in ten minutes. Tachysystole may lead to fetal decelerations or bradycardia; much literature has been published regarding the risks of uterine tachysystole with prostaglandins.
