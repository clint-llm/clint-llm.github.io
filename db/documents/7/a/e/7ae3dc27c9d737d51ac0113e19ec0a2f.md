Neonates undergo 1.5 million anesthetics for surgical procedures in the United States every year.

It is common across the United States for general anesthesiologists to take care of children 2 years of age and older for basic surgical procedures when they are otherwise reasonably healthy, meaning the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Physical Class I or II.  Children under 2, ASA class III and higher, and neonates (babies < 1 month of age) are most often cared for by pediatric anesthesiologists, which is a board-certified subspecialty of the American Board of Anesthesiology.
