The cause of the excess production of aldosterone differentiates primary from secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Primary hyperaldosteronism is due to the excess production of the adrenal gland, more specifically the zona glomerulosa. It can present more commonly as a primary tumor in the gland known as Conn syndrome or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Rarer forms of primary hyperaldosteronism are unilateral adrenal hyperplasia, ectopic aldosterone-secreting tumors, aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinomas, and familial hyperaldosteronism type 1.

Secondary hyperaldosteronism occurs due to excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This activation can be due to a renin-producing tumor, renal artery stenosis, or edematous disorders like left ventricular heart failure, pregnancy, cor pulmonale, or cirrhosis with ascites.
