Management of a shunt depends on the disease type and ranges from simple clinical observation, medical therapy, lifestyle modification to surgical intervention. Small noncyanotic shunts can often be clinically observed. Large left to right shunts do need closure to avoid the development of complications. Cyanotic shunts are associated with higher morbidity and mortality and often require surgical intervention for correction. For example, TOF needs surgical intervention, which is often done in stages. In the first phase, a connection is created between the subclavian artery and the pulmonary artery called the Blalock-Tussing shunt.

Some surgeons choose not to perform this procedure anymore and directly proceed to the next steps. In the second phase, the superior vena cava is connected to the right pulmonary artery via Glenn shunt. In the third phase, the inferior vena cava is connected to the pulmonary artery in a Fontan procedure. In cyanotic conditions, vessel thrombosis could occur due to increased hematocrit from reactive polycythemia. Phlebotomy is done on a case by case bases to correct the hematocrit. For female patients desiring to get pregnant, a discussion should be held with an obstetrician prior to conception to discuss the plans. Some disorders are associated with high obstetric mortality, and pregnancy is not advised.
