The abdominal aorta arises from the fusion of the paired dorsal aortae during embryonic development. The paired dorsal aortae are continuous with the aortic arches in the embryologic head region which, in turn, arise from the aortic sac. The aortic sac gives rise to the ascending aorta. The aortic arches, also known as the pharyngeal arch arteries, are six pairs of embryologic vascular structures that give rise to the great arteries of the head and neck, including parts of the common carotid arteries, internal carotid arteries, maxillary arteries, aortic arch, pulmonary arteries, right subclavian artery, ductus arteriosus, stapedial arteries, and hyoid artery.
