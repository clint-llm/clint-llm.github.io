An interprofessional team should be involved in the care of these patients soon after the diagnosis is made as they can have multiple medical and psychosocial issues. The caregivers should be well trained to take care of the medical equipment that these patients require at home, like ventilators and feeding tubes. Regular follow up is required to address any underlying issues quickly, and this can improve the quality of life of these patients.
