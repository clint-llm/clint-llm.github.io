Cholera is a well-known disease caused by intestinal infection with the toxin-producing bacteria Vibrio cholerae. This potentially fatal diarrheal disease results in large volumes of watery stool, causing rapid dehydration that can progress to hypovolemic shock and metabolic acidosis. The case-fatality ratio is up to half in vulnerable groups during outbreaks, but can be under 1 percent if properly treated. Today, cholera persists in regions of the world with unsatisfactory hygienic conditions and regions afflicted by natural disasters and/or humanitarian crises. The development of oral rehydration therapy, antibiotic treatment, and new oral vaccines have led to increased survival and excellent prognosis with appropriate treatment. This activity outlines the evaluation, management, and prevention of cholera and underscores the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of Vibrio cholerae infection.
- Review the risk factors that predispose patients to Vibrio cholerae infection.
- Summarize the role of oral rehydration for the treatment of patients affected by Vibrio cholerae infection.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Vibrio cholerae infection.
