In patients with portal hypertension, the falciform ligament becomes recanalized with blood vessels. The venous congestion that occurs as a result of portal hypertension causes blood to shunt towards the anterior abdominal wall. Once blood starts pooling in the falciform ligament, periumbilical bruising will be evident. With increasing portal hypertension, caput medusae will present as a clinical feature resulting from engorged and distended superficial epigastric and periumbilical veins on the anterior surface of the abdomen. When one visualizes this feature, a diagnosis of portal hypertension should be suspected. Rarely, cysts may develop on the falciform ligament which may cause vague upper abdominal pain. A CT scan is the best means for assessment of falciform ligament pathology.
