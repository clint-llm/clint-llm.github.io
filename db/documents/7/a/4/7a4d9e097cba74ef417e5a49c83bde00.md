Meckel's scan is indicated for the identification of a Meckel's diverticulum or Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia. Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia can't be detected as there are no mucoid cells that will secret the 99mTc-pertechnetate.

This study is contraindicated in patients that have undergone a recent in vivo RBC labeling scan with a pyrophosphate kit, where the circulating RBCs are treated with stannous ion via intravenous administration. Such labeling could compromise the Meckel's scan since intravenous 99mTc-pertechnetate will label RBCs rather than be secreted by the ectopic gastric mucosa; this might not be the case if the RBC labeling for the RBC scan is performed by the in vitro labeling method.
