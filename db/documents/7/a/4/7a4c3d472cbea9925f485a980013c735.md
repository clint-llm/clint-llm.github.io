Cranial sensory organs in vertebrates arise from cranial placodes, which are areas of thickening in the ectoderm. The vestibular and cochlear apparatuses develop from the otic placode, which forms by the third week of gestation. During the fourth week, the otic placode invaginates to form the otic vesicle. This otic vesicle first gives rise to the cochlear (Spiral) and vestibular (Scarpa) ganglia, and from there, peripheral and central projections of the auditory and vestibular pathways are formed.
