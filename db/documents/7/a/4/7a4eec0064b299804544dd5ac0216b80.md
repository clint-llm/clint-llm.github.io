In theÂ fourth week of embryological life, five facial primordia appear around the stomodeum (a frontonasal prominence, paired maxillary prominence, and paired mandibular prominence). Glabella and frontal bone develop from the frontal part of the frontonasal prominence.

The fetal skull shows suture in the middle of the frontal bone known as a metopic suture. The metopic suture generally fuses at the age of one year; sometimes, it persists even after the age of one year. Remnants of the interfrontal (metopic) sutures remain as the glabella.

The muscles of the glabellar complex develop from the second pharyngeal arch.
