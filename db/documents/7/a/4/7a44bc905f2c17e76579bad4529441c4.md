Follicular adenomas usually present as a solitary thyroid nodule. They are benign neoplasms in nearly 2 to 4.3 % of the population.

During the past 30 years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has raised from 4.3 cases per 100,000 in 1980 to 12.9 cases per 100,000 in 2008

The incidence rates for thyroid nodules are also increasing in the pediatric population; increased detection is surely a great component but can only explain a part of the cases
