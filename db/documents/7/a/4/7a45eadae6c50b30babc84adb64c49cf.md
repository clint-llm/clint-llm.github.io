Autonomic dysfunction, taken as a whole, is not infrequent. The most common autonomic dysfunction occurs in the cardiovascular control sphere and consists of an abnormal vasovagal response that leads to syncope. Other common manifestations are related to postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) or changes seen with Parkinson disease and other parkinsonisms. Compared to other areas of autonomic control, urinary incontinence, as observed in multiple sclerosis and other nervous system disorders, is unspecific but not rare. Some symptoms of autonomic disturbance, such as the facial vasomotor and ocular symptoms in trigeminal autonomic headaches, are of secondary significance but help in diagnosis.

Orthostatic hypotension occurs in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and in individuals with ganglionopathies that affect autonomic nerves and peripheral neuropathy. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension is proportional to age, and it is more common in institutionalized than community-dwelling elderly
