Felbamate is an anti-epileptic drug that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the management of focal seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It should be a consideration for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy where the benefit of seizure control outweighs the risk of severe idiosyncratic reactions. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of felbamate so that providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of felbamate that leads to its anti-seizure characteristics.
- Outline the various approved and other indications for felbamate.
- Identify the potential adverse events associated with felbamate therapy.
