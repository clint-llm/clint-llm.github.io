Neurological assessment in patients with TBI is based on the Glasgow coma scale, which is accepted worldwide. However, it does have some criticisms; in particular, the scale is not ordinal or linear. For instance, losing two points in speech may represent a focal neurological deficit with injury to a brain region responsible for speech as opposed to representing a disorder of consciousness.

Signs of mass effect on the head CT scan include midline shift, obliteration of the basal cisterns, effacement of the ventricles, obstructive hydrocephalus, and sulcal effacement. The mass effect should prompt the clinician to look for possible herniation. Tonsillar herniation is visualized on coronal imaging by crowding of the foramen magnum, effacement of the CSF cisterns surrounding the brainstem and, on sagittal views, the descent of the cerebellar tonsils below the level of the foramen magnum.

If the patient needs acute management, the placement of an ICP monitoring system may be indicated. This is usually in the form of an ICP bolt or intraventricular catheter. With herniation syndromes, ICP is typically high, at least over 20 mm Hg. The waveform will likely indicate a loss in intracranial compliance. On the ICP waveform, there are three waves; the first (P1) represents systole and is known as the "percussion wave" or "arterial kick." The second (P2) represents the "tidal wave" of brain compliance, and the third (P3) is the venous wave or "dicrotic notch." In normal physiology, P1 should be higher than P2, which is higher than the P3. (see media image 2) When P2 is the highest wave, compliance is lost. This indicates an intracranial compartment that is no longer able to compensate for increased volumes, and so, the pressure rises.
