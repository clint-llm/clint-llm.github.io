The key to preventing the high mortality following a bowel obstruction is the early diagnosis, resuscitation, and operative intervention. An interprofessional team is vital to ensure that the patient receives prompt attention. The triage nurse must be fully aware of the signs of bowel obstruction and expedite the admission. The emergency physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant must examine the patient and get the appropriate radiological test. The surgeon must be consulted even if no intervention is planned. While awaiting surgery, the bowel may need to be decompressed with a nasogastric tube, and the nurse is essential for monitoring of vital signs and worsening of the obstruction. Communication between healthcare workers is critical.

**Outcomes**

The morbidity and mortality of bowel obstruction are dependent on early diagnosis and management. If any strangulated bowel is left untreated, there is a mortality rate of close to 100%. However, if surgery is undertaken within 24-48 hours, the mortality rates are less than 10%. Factors that determine the morbidity include the age of patient, comorbidity, and delay in treatment. Today, the overall mortality of bowel obstruction is still about 5%-8%.
