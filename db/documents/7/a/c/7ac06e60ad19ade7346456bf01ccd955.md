Annular pancreasÂ is not commonly encountered in clinical practice and is primarily considered to be a disease of infancy, which is untrue as the diagnosis of AP is made with nearly equal frequency in children and adults. However, specific guidelines outlining the management of AP are lacking; therefore, the management must be individualized.

Timely identification and management of chromosomal anomalies and malformations associated with this condition are important to reduce morbidity and mortality. Prenatal diagnosis of this anomaly helps in preplanning and management at a center equipped with advanced neonatal care.
