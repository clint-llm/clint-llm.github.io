The management of osteoradionecrosis is best done with an interprofessional team that includes providers, pharmacists, and nurses across the fields of oral surgery, infectious disease, radiology, and hyperbaric medicine. None of these treatments can exist in a vacuum and if attempted separately, will likely not be successful. Patients should be staged and treated with perioperative hyperbaric treatments and antibiotic therapy, with surgery as needed based on the stage of the osteoradionecrosis. All necrotic bone must be surgically removed.
