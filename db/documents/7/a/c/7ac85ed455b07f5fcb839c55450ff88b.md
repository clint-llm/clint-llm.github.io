The differential diagnosis for eczema herpeticum includes impetigo, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, eczema coxsackium, primary varicella infection, disseminated herpes zoster, disseminated molluscum contagiosum, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, cellulitis, and erysipelas. Misdiagnosis of EH can lead to delayed initiation of antiviral treatment and subsequent complications. Diagnostic clues that favor EH are painful lesions, monomorphic size of the lesions, and characteristic "punched-out" erosions in areas of pre-existing atopic dermatitis. Unlike herpes zoster, EH does not respect dermatomal boundaries.
