Located bilaterally on the lateral aspect of the oropharynx and near the entrance of the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tracts, the palatine tonsils come into contact with various inhaled or ingested pathogens and other materials that may gain exposure to the body through the mouth.  As a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, the palatine tonsils serve as the primary lymphatic tissue of the oropharynx.

Palatine tonsils consist of approximately 15 crypts, which provide a large internal surface area.  The follicular germinal center, mantle zones, extrafollicular area, and reticular crypt epithelium play a key role in the immunological regulation of this mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.

In humans, the initial portion known as the tonsillar epithelium gets exposed to the external (pharyngeal) environment.  Due to their strategic location, this tissue frequently demands more blood to assist in immune responses to common illnesses like viral upper respiratory infections.  Tonsils also have specialized surface antigen capture cells called M cells that allow for the uptake of antigens produced by pathogens.
