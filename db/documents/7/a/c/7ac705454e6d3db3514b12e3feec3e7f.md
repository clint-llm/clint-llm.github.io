There are various ways to structure an effective debriefing session that allows learners to uncover their frame of reference and reorganize their educational agenda. The Center for Medical Simulation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has lead simulation educator courses called “Debriefing with Good Judgement.”

**Three-Phase Debriefing Structures**

Rudolph et al. first described the 3-phase conversational structure for debriefing, including the reaction, analysis, and summary phases.

The GAS model was developed in 2009 by the Winter Institute for Simulation, Education, and Research in Pittsburgh in conjunction with the AHA.

******Multi-Phase Debriefing Structures**

A blended approach to debriefing known as ‘‘PEARLS’’ (Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation) utilizes a 4-phase debriefing framework.

Another 7-phase model known as healthcare simulation after-action review (AAR) is based upon the US Army’s AAR construct.
