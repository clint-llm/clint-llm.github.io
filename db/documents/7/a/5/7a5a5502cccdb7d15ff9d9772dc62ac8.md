Non-traumatic Intracerebral hemorrhage can be divided into primary and secondary, where primary bleeds account for 85% of all ICH and are related to chronic hypertension or amyloid angiopathy.

Primary or spontaneous ICH accounts for over 85% of hemorrhagic strokes.

In contrast, when an ICH is due to an underlying structural pathology, such as vascular anomalies or malignant tissue, they are categorized as secondary ICH. Vascular lesions include arteriovenous malformations, cavernous angiomas, cerebral aneurysms, and aorto-venous fistulae, and these are often the cause of ICH in the young, otherwise healthy, population. Cerebral hematomas may also be secondary to a primary or metastatic lesion or even the hemorrhagic conversion of a recent ischaemic infarct

Studies have elicited certain tendencies in the population that suffer ICHs, thereby hypothesizing both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. The latter include non-white ethnicity, older age, familial apolipoprotein syndromes, and being male.
