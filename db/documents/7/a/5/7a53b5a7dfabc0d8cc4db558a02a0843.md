**Clinical Features**

Hypertensive retinopathy is usually asymptomatic and is diagnosed on fundoscopic features. The following are signs of hypertensive retinopathy.

**AV Crossing Changes
**

- Salus’s sign: Deflection of retinal vein as it crosses the arteriole.

- Gunn’s sign: Tapering of the retinal vein on either side of the AV crossing.

- Bonnet’s sign: Banking of the retinal vein distal to the AV crossing.

**Arterial Changes
**

- Decrease in the arteriovenous ratio to 1:3 ( the normal ratio is 2:3).

- Change in the arteriolar light reflex (light reflex appears as copper and/or silver wiring)

**Retinal Changes
**

- Retinal hemorrhages: 

- Dot-blot hemorrhages: Bleeding in the inner retinal layer
- Flame shaped hemorrhage: Bleeding is in the superficial retinal layer

- Retinal exudates:

- Hard exudates: Lipid deposits in the retina
- Soft exudates: These are also known as cotton wool spots which appear due to ischemia of the nerve fibers

**Macular Changes
**

Macular star formation due to deposition of hard exudates around the macula.

**Optic Nerve Changes
**

Optic disk swelling (also known as hypertensive optic neuropathy)

In a study by Wong et al., they identified certain retinal signs to be associated with increased risk for stroke. The signs are AV nicking, focal arteriolar narrowing (as this is associated with arteriosclerosis), microaneurysms, cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages (dot blot and flame-shaped), and decreased AV ratio.
