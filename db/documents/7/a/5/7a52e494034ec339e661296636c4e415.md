This activity reviews 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, an important cause of ambiguous genitalia in children. Initially, the phenotype of children with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency can vary from underdeveloped male genitalia to fully developed female genitalia. This phenotype may change during puberty, at which point male secondary sex characteristics may develop. This activity will assist practitioners in recognizing when to consider this diagnosis and how to manage it. This activity highlights the critical role of the interprofessional care team in caring for patients with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency.

**Objectives:**
- Review the roles of testosterone versus dihydrotestosterone in both male fetal development and puberty.
- Describe some of the gender identity struggles that children with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency may face when they reach puberty.
- Identify the testing that should be done if 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is suspected, and identify whether additional testing is useful.
- Explain how interprofessional team members can collaborate to provide optimal counseling to patients with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency and their families.
