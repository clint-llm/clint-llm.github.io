CMNs are typically characterized by nevomelanocytes or nevus cells in the epidermis in well-ordered clusters as well as in the dermis as cords, sheets, or nests. When compared to acquired nevi, CMNs more commonly extend deeper into the dermis or subcutaneous fat layer.

The nevus cells cluster around dermal appendages such as the pilar apparatus, neurovascular structures, and sebaceous glands.
