**Laboratory Evaluation**

Standard trauma labs should be obtained, for example, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation panel, lactate, among others, along with urine for analysis. Hematuria is observed more in the blunt renal trauma patient than penetrating renal trauma and if present has an increased frequency of microscopic hematuria versus gross hematuria. Although hematuria can be the landmark of renal injury, the degree ofÂ hematuria (present or not) has not shown correlation in predicting the severity of renal injury.

**Imaging Evaluation**

The modality of choice in the suspected renal trauma patient is contrast-enhanced computed tomography with immediate and delayed imaging.

Renal imaging should be included, but not limited to the following clinical scenarios

- Blunt abdominal trauma with gross and microscopic hematuria

- Blunt abdominal trauma with hemodynamic instability

- Penetrating trauma to the chest, abdomen, flank or back and any entry/exit wounds that eludes a trajectory that includes the kidneys

- High clinical suspicion based on the mechanism of injury (i.e., displaced rib fractures adjacent to the kidney, high-speed motor vehicle accident, fall from significant height)

**Injury Grading**

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grading system the most common injury grading system used for renal trauma.
