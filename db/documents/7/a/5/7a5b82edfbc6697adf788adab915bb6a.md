Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is an advanced bronchoscopic technique employing a side-viewing ultrasound transducer (either convex or radial) combined with a fibreoptic bronchoscope. Clinicians can assess and sample lymph nodes within the proximal bronchial tree, the hilar regions, and anterosuperior mediastinum, as well as both endobronchial and peribronchial mass lesions.

Developed in the 1990s, clinical use has become widespread in the last 20 years, with endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) becoming a gold standard test for tissue sampling staging of non-small cell lung cancerÂ and the diagnostic assessment of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
