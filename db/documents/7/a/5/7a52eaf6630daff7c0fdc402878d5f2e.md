The test of choice for chronic acalculous cholecystitis is a cholescintigraphy nuclear scan (HIDA) with the administration of cholecystokinin (CCK). This study examines the function of the gallbladder. After the radionuclide is administered, CCK is given to stimulate the gallbladder to empty. A calculated ejection fraction of 35% or less may be indicative of hypokinetic functioning of the gallbladder. An ultrasound of the gallbladder may also be useful. If this shows a thickened gallbladder wall of over 3.5 mm, this may be due to cholecystitis.

Blood work is not diagnostic but will reveal an elevated WBC and abnormal liver function tests.

The diagnosis of acute acalculous cholecystitis can often be made with an ultrasound of the abdomen. The gallbladder will show a significantly thickened wall with edema and possible pericholecystic fluid. CT scans may also make this diagnosis. If there is still uncertainty about the diagnosis, then a HIDA scan can be done. Acute cholecystitis will result in no filling of the gallbladder with the radionuclide material.
