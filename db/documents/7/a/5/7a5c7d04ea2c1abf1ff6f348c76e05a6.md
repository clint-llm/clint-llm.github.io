Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is a radiographic test that allows visualization of the heart as a whole and individualized cardiac structures. Common structures of interest include atria, ventricles, pericardium, great cardiac vessels, myocardium, and intra-cardiac valves. CCTA is a contrast-enhanced radiographic assessment of the epicardial coronary arteries. Limited views of cardiac-adjacent pulmonary and osseous structures are also typically obtained in standard cardiac CT windows. Cardiac CT can also be applied in the diagnosis of cardiac anatomical abnormalities, such as CHD and anomalous coronary arteries.
