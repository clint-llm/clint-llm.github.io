Women presenting with abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, and fever during labor must be evaluated for other causes. In women with premature rupture of membranes, the interprofessional team must consider the risk of multiple examinations and avoid multiple digital exams. Nursing and physician communication is important to assure the initial examination is done with a sterile speculum. Clear communication is also required between team members to ensure the physician is alerted to any changes in pain, fever, or clinical status. Obstetrical nurses administer care, monitor patients, and provide feedback to the team.When choosing antibiotics, medical records should be reviewed thoroughly, giving special attention to the history of allergies and any previous reactions to penicillin or any other antibiotics. This information must be reported to the pharmacy when ordering medication and reviewed by the team. Pharmacists review medications prescribed, check for drug-drug interactions, and may participate in patient education.If the patient requires a cesarean section, these items must be reviewed again during the time out in the operating room.
