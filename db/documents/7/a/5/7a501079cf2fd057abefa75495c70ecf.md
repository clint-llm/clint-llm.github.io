Terbinafine has FDA approval to treat onychomycosis that is suspected or proven to be caused by dermatophyte organisms. Indications for oral therapy include the following

- Proximal subungual onychomycosis

- Distal lateral subungual onychomycosis affecting over 50% of the nail plate with nail matrix involvement and plate thickness greater than two millimeters

- Greater than or equal to three nails involved

Oral terbinafine has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for the mycological cure of toenail dermatophyte infections.

Treatment of onychomycosis in the pediatric population with systemic medications is off-label, and it is not U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. Although there are no proposed USA guidelines, terbinafine has been recommended by the British Association of Dermatologists as a first-line treatment.

The treatment of tinea capitis is an additional non-FDA use of terbinafine. Notably, although both griseofulvin and terbinafine are effective treatment options for pediatric tinea capitis, terbinafine has demonstrated superiority in the treatment of infections caused by Trichophyton spp., while griseofulvin was more effective at treating hair shaft infections caused by Microsporum spp. As Trichophyton spp. are the most common cause of tinea capitis in North America, terbinafine is often the treatment for this condition.
