Much has changed in the field of orthopedic implants. Newer designs, improved materials, and surgical innovation have improved patient outcomes.  There are areas of concern, despite these advances.  Peer-reviewed data and non-biased implant research are essential for the deployment of newer devices that are safe and effective.

Implants are used in a variety of orthopedic procedures. The importance of understanding how to select the right implant based on the task at hand cannot be overstated.

Orthopedic implant design continues to evolve, and as we attempt to tackle the challenges of cost, reliability, longevity, and infection prevention.
