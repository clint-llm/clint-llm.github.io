The actual incidence of ozone toxicity remains unknown but in any case, healthcare providers, emergency room personnel, and nurse practitioners should be familiar with the presentation and management of ozone toxicity. In most cases, the toxicity occurs because of improper use of ozone. Because there is little known about the management of ozone toxicity one should apply the trauma ABCDE protocol and offer supportive care. Most patients do improve with corticosteroid/oxygen therapy.
