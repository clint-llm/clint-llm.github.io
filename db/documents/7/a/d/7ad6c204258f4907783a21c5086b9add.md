Most infected individuals will provide a history of mosquito exposure in an endemic area. The incubation period is from 5 to 15 days. There is often a prodromal period of nonspecific symptoms of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias, which may last for several days. Rarely, symptoms then progress to meningitis, which is the most common neurologic manifestation, and even more rarely to encephalitis.Â  Symptoms may include altered mental status, agitation, confusion, and coma. About 40% of children and young adults develop only fever, headache, or aseptic meningitis but almost 90% of elderly patients develop encephalitis. Transplant and immunocompromised patients also have a greater risk of neuroinvasive disease. There is no associated rash.
