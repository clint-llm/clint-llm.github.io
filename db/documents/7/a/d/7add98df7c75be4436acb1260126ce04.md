Septic or suppurative thrombophlebitis (STP) is defined by the presence of an endovascular thrombus in the setting of associated bacterial or fungal infection. Venous infections can arise from an associated intravenous catheter, skin breakdown, or by invasion from adjacent nonvascular structures. Although this process can occur in both superficial and deep vessels of the body, it is seen most commonly in venous structures (e.g., peripheral veins, pelvic veins, superior vena cava, internal jugular vein, portal veins or dural sinuses). The patient presentation may vary from a mild infection of the superficial veins to a severe, systemic infection. Once STP is present, several complications related to the hematogenous bacterial spread and septic thromboembolism may develop, such as endocarditis, septic arthritis, and even septic uveitis. The morbidity and mortality of STP if not treated, is high, although the risk of significant morbidity and mortality depends on the location of the thrombus.
