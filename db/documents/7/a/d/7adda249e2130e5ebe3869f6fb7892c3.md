Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). The global prevalence of acute TIN is 1 to 3% among all renal biopsies. The overall prevalence of acute TIN increased to 15-27% when the analysis was restricted to only AKI cases.

In this study, most patients accounted for adults and the elderly, and only 5% were children, male (53%) compared to females (47%). Data analysis from Czech registries of renal biopsies insisted the rate of TIN was 4%, but when analyzed only among the patients with renal insufficiency, it was around 12%.
