The benefits of the pulmonary rehabilitation program are measured using different parameters. Most of the initial studies in pulmonary rehabilitation were done in patients with COPD, but that has changed recently. Pulmonary rehabilitation is being utilized for patients with different lung diseases, and outcomes may be driven inherently by the underlying disease process.

Survival benefit is one of the important outcomes looked at in pulmonary rehabilitation. In one study, pulmonary rehabilitation initiated within three months of hospital discharge was noted to have a lower risk of mortality at one year; however, other studies have challenged that.

Multiple studies have shown improvements in maximal exercise capacity and functional exercise capacity with pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with various chronic lung diseases, including post-lung transplant.

Chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD, also have a major monetary impact. Healthcare costs attributable to COPD are estimated to reach approximately $49 billion by 2020 as per the Center for Disease Control (CDC).

With smoking contributing to the bulk of the COPD cases and its role in the progression of the disease, pulmonary rehabilitation program provides a unique opportunity to address smoking cessation. Smokers are motivated to stop smoking in a rehabilitation environment with the effects of positive reinforcement.

With the increasing volume of evidence in favor of early initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation, the British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend that patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD should be offered pulmonary rehabilitation at hospital discharge to commence within one month of discharge.
