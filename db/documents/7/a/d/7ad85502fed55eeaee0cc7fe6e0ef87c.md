Managing thalamic pain syndrome requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes primary care physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, cognitive-behavioral therapists,  and several physicians in different specialists, including pain medicine physicians, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and specialty care nurses. Without exceptional management, the morbidity from thalamic pain syndrome. Once thalamic pain is identified, either immediately following a CVA, or weeks to years after a stroke, coordinating the care is critical and includes the following:

- Following a stroke, a patient should see their primary care provider.

- If a patient develops new-onset neurological symptoms following a CVA, a CT or MRI is warranted

- The development of chronic pain following a CVA is concerning for central post-stroke pain. If the pain is associated with temperature sensitivities, it is suggestive of thalamic pain syndrome.

- Patients with post-stroke pain often require pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies. Pharmacological therapy should involve a clinical pharmacist, who can assist in therapy selection, monitor dosing, and counsel both patients and team members on side effects.

- The primary care provider can manage the symptoms of thalamic pain syndrome but may consider a referral to a neurologist for their expertise in handling this syndrome.

- A pain medicine specialist may also be necessary to combat the complicated nature of thalamic pain.

- When all other therapies have failed, neurosurgery should be a consideration.

- Opioid analgesics are a second or third-line treatment option for patients who develop central poststroke pain. The side effects, signs, and symptoms of opioid intoxication should have close monitoring.

- All post-stroke sequelae require optimization in the setting of thalamic pain syndrome. Patients often require physical, speech, and occupational therapy, as well as home health nursing.

- Lastly, comorbid depression should be monitored closely and treated appropriately. Patients can benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy.

The management of post-stroke pain is often a life-long endeavor. The sequella of a cerebrovascular accident is challenging to manage even without the addition of chronic pain. Only by working as an interprofessional team can the morbidity of thalamic pain syndrome be decreased. The long-term outcomes for pain relief and improvement of the patient's quality of life remain guarded. [Level 5]
