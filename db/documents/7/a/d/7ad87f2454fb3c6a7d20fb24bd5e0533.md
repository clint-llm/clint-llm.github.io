Signs and symptoms of hydrocodone toxicity are apnea, difficulties in breathing, bradycardia, miosis, clammy skin, cyanosis, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. Pulmonary complications of overdose include noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonitis. Respiratory acidosis is common because of central respiratory depression that causes CO2 retention.

The antidote for overdose is an opioid antagonist medication. Hence, the clinician should administer intravenous naloxone for hydrocodone overdose. Naloxone can be administered by the intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and endotracheal routes. Patients with low respiratory rates or apnea should be administered 0.4 to 2 mg of naloxone as an initial dose; patients who develop respiratory failure should be administered 2 mg of naloxone. Naloxone may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes, based on the clinical response. If there are signs of opioid withdrawal, naloxone infusion should be stopped.

The indication for airway management is severe respiratory depression or apnea secondary to hydrocodone toxicity. Acute respiratory distress syndrome should be managed with adequate oxygenation, low tidal volume ventilation, and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Caution is necessary to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury.

Patients who have taken extended-release preparations need prolonged monitoring even after the reversal, as delayed absorption of hydrocodone is possible.

Emergency department physicians should refer patients for psychiatric evaluation once the patient is stable.

It is noteworthy that the FDA has approved hydrocodone formulations with abuse-deterrent properties. These formulations are manufactured to prevent abuse through chewing, injecting, or snorting.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency precipitated by hydrocodone can be life-threatening and requires prompt corticosteroid replacement.
