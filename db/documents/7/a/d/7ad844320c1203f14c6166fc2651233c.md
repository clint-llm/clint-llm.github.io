Thymic hyperplasia could be true thymic or lymphoid hyperplasia. It is usually found incidentally or could present with compressive symptoms or systemic symptoms due to autoimmune disease like myasthenia gravis. The diagnosis is made through a chest CT or MRI. Treatment for symptomatic patients is mostly thymectomy. This activity describes pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of thymic hyperplasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of patients with thymic hyperplasia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of thymic hyperplasia.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with thymic hyperplasia.
- Outline the treatment of a patient with thymic hyperplasia.
