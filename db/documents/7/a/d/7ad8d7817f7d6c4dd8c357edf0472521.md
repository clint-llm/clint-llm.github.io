The most common mechanism is blunt or penetratingÂ trauma directly to the scapula. The physical exam and history can give the physician pertinent information and help rule out associated injuries that can be life-threatening. In a high energy trauma situation, depending on the patient's mental status this is not always possible. The physical exam of the shoulder and upper extremity should be performed in a matter that allows examination of the posterior forequarter. This can be difficult when the patient has multiple injuries and is supine in bed. Asymmetry of displacement of the shoulder or humeral head can be obvious or subtle. Palpation and visual examination of the bony landmarks should be performed followed by a thorough neurovascular examination of the upper extremity. Brachial plexus injuries can be associated with scapula fractures in 5-13 percent of patients.
