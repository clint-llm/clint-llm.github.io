The US population older than 65 who take five or more prescription medications increased from 24% to 39% between 1999 and 2012. Studies estimate that nursing home patients take eight different medications on average, and medication errors occur in two-thirds of such patients. Geriatric polypharmacy is associated with increased health care utilization, costs, medication nonadherence, and functional decline.

In the US alone, there would be 72.1 million individuals aged more than 65 by 2030, which is more than double the number of older people in 2000. Older adults comprise about 15% of the total US population, but they account for 30 to 35% of prescription and nonprescription medication use. According to the published data, by 2030, the population age 65 and older will represent 20% of the US population and about 50% of healthcare costs. The current prevalence of polypharmacy is between 8 to 78% in Age group more than 65. Older adults in the US are the largest consumers of medications, making polypharmacy a significant public health problem.
