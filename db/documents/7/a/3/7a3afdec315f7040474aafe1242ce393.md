Various imaging modalities exist to visualize the anatomy of the pelvis. An ultrasound is a cost-effective and minimally invasive imaging modality that can display the structures of the genitourinary system to highlight renal or gonadal abnormalities; this is the first choice when evaluating pediatric patients, as it is painless, widely available, and immediate. Through prenatal imaging, ninety percent of fetal kidneys are identifiable by 17 to 20 weeks gestation and 95% by 22 weeks gestation.

Ultrasound is essential in the diagnosis of horseshoe kidney, renal agenesis, Wilms’ tumor, polycystic kidney disease, and urachal anomalies. A CT scan can also be performed but at the expense of radiation exposure and may involve contrast dye. MRI, though expensive, can also be employed to visualize structures of the genitourinary system with more detail, and is the gold standard for evaluating uterine anomalies.

Measurement of the amniotic fluid index aids in the evaluation of the kidney function of the fetus, as too little amniotic fluid, oligohydramnios, results in poor lung development. In contrast, polyhydramnios, too much amniotic fluid, indicates a problem with swallowing, such as esophageal atresia.
