**Precocious Puberty**

Premature activation of the HPG axis underlies the etiology of precocious puberty, with the defining characteristic being pubertal characteristics manifesting before age 8 in girls and 9 in boys. While the exact cause of precocious puberty is unknown, congenital malformations and acquired insults have both merited consideration as potential etiologies.

**Delayed Puberty**

Delayed puberty is a diagnosis of exclusion most often cited in males, typically resulting in delayed skeletal maturation compared to individuals of the same age within the same population. Delayed puberty commonly resolves without issue and can be seen amongst multiple familial generations. Proper counseling of patients is imperative as delayed puberty can result in potential stigma among their peers. It is essential to exclude possible causes of delayed maturation, such as hypogonadism, as these conditions require pharmacologic treatment.

**Hypogonadism**

Male and female hypogonadism results from the underproduction of their respective hormonal counterpart. Proper diagnosis requires a complete history, physical exam, and laboratory evidence. Male hypogonadism refers to symptomatology secondary to the underproduction of testosterone with a proper formation of spermatozoa. With testosterone playing a pivotal role in growth spurts, facial hair growth, penile elongation, and testicular enlargement, a deficiency can result in underdevelopment in these areas. The two subsets, primary and secondary, result from pathology in the testicles or the hypothalamus/pituitary.

Precocious puberty, delayed puberty, and hypogonadism all require evaluation by a pediatric endocrinologist. Depending on patient presentation, hormonal therapy may be utilized, as it allows for the halting or the initiation of puberty and is the mainstay of treatment.
