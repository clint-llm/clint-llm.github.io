The sickle hemoglobin mutation (hemoglobin S or HbS) results in the replacement of the glutamate for valine in the sixth amino acid position of the beta-globin chain, thereby changing the arrangement of the Hb tetramer molecule in the homozygous person from A2B2 to A2BS2. SCD occurs in those homozygous for HbS (referred to as sickle cell anemia) or in heterozygotes when HbS coexists with another abnormal or missing beta-chain, for example, HbC (A2SC) or HbS beta thalassemia (A2SBthal). Sickle cell trait occurs in those heterozygous for HbS when the other Hb molecule is normal HbAS (A2SB).

Some of the risk factors associated with progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in SCN include:

- Genetic variants of MYH9 and APOL1

- Infection with parvovirus B19

- Recurrent Acute chest syndrome

- Vaso occlusive episodes

- Nephrotic range proteinuria

- Underlying hypertension

- Severe anemia

Coinheritance with alpha-thalassemia apart from higher fetal hemoglobin is protective factors.
