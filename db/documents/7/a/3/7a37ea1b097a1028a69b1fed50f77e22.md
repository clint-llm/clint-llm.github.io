an interprofessional team including physician/nursing staff, nutritionist/dietitian, palliative service, social worker and case manager should be invited to participate and contribute in all new CRC diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship patient care. Screening for colorectal cancer is essential to identify premalignant lesions which have been shown to reduce the mortality of this disease but currently is underutilized.

Extended third-generation, blood-relative, family history pedigree from CRC patients can identify those at risk of an unrecognized hereditary syndrome and further offer early and aggressive screening on survivorâ€™s own risk and family members.

For all CRC patients during and after completion of treatment, a discussion on lifestyle changes, including to follow a healthy diet, obtain and maintain ideal body weight, establish an active exercise routine, minimize alcohol consumption and quitting smoking, should be encouraged.

CRC patients should be regularly screened for early identification of symptoms of psychosocial stress and offer early preventive interventions that would improve the quality of life and reduce suffering.
