The clinical presentation of pruritus in CKD patients varies greatly from one patient to another. The severity and pattern of itching in uremic pruritus are variable. While some patients report mild and intermittent symptoms, others report irritatingly persistent symptoms. In one survey of symptom distress, quality of sleep, and quality of life performed on 301 maintenance hemodialysis patients, and itching ranked as the most severe symptom.

Itching may be localized or generalized. Localized uremic pruritus predominantly affects the face, back, or shunt arm, although any body part can be affected.

A study reports that uremic patients have itching daily or nearly daily, and most patients have itching on large, discontinuous, bilateral, and symmetric areas of skin.

As the presentation of pruritus in CKD may be variable, it could be challenging to distinguish it from other causes of itching. Generally, a nonuremic cause of pruritus should be considered in cases where a suitable treatment trial has failed, particularly in patients with asymmetric symptoms, ulcerating or bullous lesions, or who present with clinical findings suggestive of other systemic diseases. Additionally, pruritus may present as an adverse drug reaction from recently started or long-standing pharmacologic therapy.

Morphologically, the skin may appear normal. Alternatively, there may be evidence of chronic itching, like scratch marks, scars, and linear crusts. Other findings include impetigo, papules, and prurigo nodularis.
