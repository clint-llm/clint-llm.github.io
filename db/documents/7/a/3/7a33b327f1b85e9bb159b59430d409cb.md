A well-performed history of a patient can raise suspicion for vitamin A deficiency. The presence of a malabsorptive process, such as IBD, chronic GI infection, cirrhosis, pancreatic insufficiency, prematurity, rubeola infection (measles), a history of living in a resource-poor country, or current pregnancy or lactation in the setting of poor nutrition should raise concern for vitamin A deficiency. The natural progression of chronic VAD most commonly presents with the gradual development of night blindness, increased frequency of GI, pulmonary, and urinary infections, and development of xeroderma and phrynoderma (follicular hyperkeratosis often found on extensor surfaces, shoulders, and buttocks).

As the severity of deficiency worsens, signs of xerophthalmia develop with Bitot spots (conjunctival, triangular or oval, foamy lesions) and conjunctival xerosis (appears as conjunctival wrinkling). If VAD continues to persist, its later stages present as corneal xerosis, corneal ulceration, and eventually keratomalacia as the corneal ulcers heal, corneal scarring and blindness results. In the setting of an infection, particularly measles, patients with an acute deficiency may present with corneal xerosis and ulceration without preceding night blindness or Bitotâ€™s spots.
