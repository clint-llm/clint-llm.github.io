Tetanus toxin is administered through vaccination with DTP at 2, 4, 6, 12-18 months of age and then at 4-6 years, 11-12 years, and every 10 years thereafter. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to vaccination in the 2nd or 3rd trimester.

Secondary prevention is done by thorough wound cleaning, debridement, and administration of tetanus toxoid. It is not always necessary to wait for 10 years to get the adult tetanus toxoid after the last dose as the duration decrease with increasing age.
