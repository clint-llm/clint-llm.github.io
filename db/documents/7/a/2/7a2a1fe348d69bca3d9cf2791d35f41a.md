The differential diagnosis for SLAC wrist and SLIL injury is broad and includes various causes of wrist pain:

- Scaphoid fracture

- Distal radial fractures

- Dorsal ganglion cyst

- Septic arthritis

- Avascular necrosis of the scaphoid

- Gout

- Pseudogout

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Tear of the  triangular fibrocartilage complex

- Kienbock's disease

- Tenosynovitis

- Lunate fracture vs dislocation

- Dorsal intercalated segmental instability

Of note, many of the differentials described above, such as crystalline arthropathies, for example, can secondarily lead to SLAC wrist.
