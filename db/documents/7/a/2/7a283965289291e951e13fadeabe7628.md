Most bladder injuries require a urinary catheter to drain the bladder for some time until the bladder injury is healed. Patients should be taught about catheter care and hygiene. Patients who have undergone surgery are instructed to return after 10 days for staple removal. Xray cystogram is repeated after 14 days of surgery to check healing and if any leakage exists. If the cystogram is normal then the catheter is removed. Some patients who have severe injuries can develop urinary incontinence, they should be counseled about that.
