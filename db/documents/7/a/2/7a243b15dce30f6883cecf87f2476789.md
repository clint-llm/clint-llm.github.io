Endogenous endophthalmitis is a blood-borne metastatic infection from the primary inoculation site secondary to bacterial or a fungal pathology.

The direct infectious spread has also been reported from the brain to the optic nerve. The primary mechanism of damage in EE is septic emboli that migrate to the posterior segment vessels. This, in turn, acts as a focus for the spread of microorganisms to the neighboring tissues after breaching the blood-retinal barrier. Further, the microorganism proliferates and causes inflammation within these tissues.

The infection then spread from the posterior segment to the anterior segment of the eye. One of the previous studies document no underlying source of infection in approximately 44% of the cases, but still, EE patients should undergo a detailed systemic evaluation to rule out the primary focus of infection.
