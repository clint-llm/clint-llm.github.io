A thorough cardiovascular exam should be completed for all patients identified as having pulsus alternans. Given the common underlying etiologies, patients with pulsus alternans will often present with overt signs of decompensated heart failure. This includes elevated jugular venous pressure, bibasilar rales, and peripheral edema. Depending upon the degree of cardiac decompensation, the patient may also be tachycardic, tachypneic, or hypotensive. The presence of an aortic stenosis murmur, S3, or S4, is another exam finding for which one should look. A more specific physical exam finding classically associated with pulsus alternans would be alternating strong and soft pulses of the radial artery.

Pulsus alternans can be identified by palpating the artery, using a sphygmomanometer, and examining arterial and plethysmographic waveforms.
