In hand surgery, the knowledge of the blood supply to the fingers and thumb is essential. The dominant blood supply to the thumb comes from the princeps pollicis artery. If the princeps pollicis artery is compromised, there could be irreversible damage to the thumb. With the proper knowledge of the vascular network within the thumb, this can lead to successful surgical reconstruction or repair of the thumb.

The reason that the princeps pollicis artery is so important in surgery is the fact that it does not receive much collateral blood flow. The princeps pollicis artery is considered a distal terminal artery.
