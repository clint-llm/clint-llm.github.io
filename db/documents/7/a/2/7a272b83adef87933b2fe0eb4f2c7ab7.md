Most pontine tumors are diffuse; as such, chemotherapy/radiotherapy frequently preferred over resection surgery. However, patients with focal, low-grade tumors are the best candidate for surgery. The pons is identified superiorly by pontomesencephalic and inferiorly by a pontomedullary sulcus, and divided into ventral and dorsal, or anterior and posterior at the level of the medial lemniscus. The pyramidal tract within the pons is more medial and ventral compared in the midbrain, as well as the CN V, CN VI, CN VII, and CN III nerves and their nuclei.

The facial nerve courses around the abducens nerve nucleus within the pons, and must be very well established anatomical relation when lessons are approached through the rhomboid fossa. The choice of route for neurosurgical access to the pons is primarily determined by the specific location of the pontine lesson. Anterior and upper pontine lessons are accessible through an orbito-fronto-zygomatic route, which a modified form of the supraorbital craniotomy.

For the orbito-fronto-zygomatic route, the oculomotor nerve (CN III) is considered a key reference point. Dissection of interpeduncular and prepontine cisterns with the durotomy of the tentorium is necessary to expose the upper pons, and this entry point is also known as supra-trigeminal. In the anterior approach, the region around the emergence of the trigeminal nerve is a safe area to be accessed 1 cm wide at 1 cm from the midline, but should not extend too anterior to avoid the corticospinal tract.

The sigmoid approach can be useful for lesions in the anterior, inferior, or ventrolateral portions of the pons reached via paramedian occipital or petrosal route. However, due to the very narrow corridor, this approach is only suitable for biopsy or resecting cavernomas therein. To access a longitudinal incision is made between the points of emergence of the CN V and CN VII. Lesions in the dorsal pons are accessed through the rhomboid fossa.

A telovelar route, in other words, the cerebellomedullary fissure approach, is used to access superior and posterior dorsal pontine lesions. The suprafacial triangle is a safe entry triangle, defined caudally by the facial nerve (facial colliculus is the reference), medially by the median sulcus (medial longitudinal fasciculus), and laterally by the superior cerebellar peduncles.

However, bipolar stimulation on the surface to localize facial nerve course is recommended, to avoid injury, and entry must always be 2 mm away from the midline to preserve the MLF (medial longitudinal fasciculus). The infracollicular route accesses posterior and inferior lesions via the infrafacial triangle, that bordered medially by the MLF (medial longitudinal fasciculus), laterally by the facial nerve, and caudally by the medullary striae. Intraoperative monitoring is mandatory for this route.
