Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is frequently associated with a hypercoagulable state. The most common association of LS endocarditis is with

- **Malignancies: **The prevalence is 1.25% in this patient group versus 0.25% in the general population. It is mainly associated with solid tumors such as adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, colon, ovary, lung, biliary, and prostate. The rate was 2.7% in solid tumors versus 0.47% other types of malignancy.

- **Systemic Lupus erythematous:**Studies show that NBTE is present in 6 to 11% of lupus patients. An autopsy study reported the presence of NBTE in 50% of lupus cases. A significant correlation exists between LS endocarditis and SLE duration and severity.

- **Antiphospholipid Syndrome:**Whether primary (idiopathic) or secondary (SLE), studies suggested a prevalence of 33% in these patients versus 4 % in the control group of NTBE. Also, it shows that patients how to have SLE with positive antiphospholipid have a higher prevalence of this disease that patients who carry one of these diseases.

- **Others:** There are reports of cases in patients who have disseminated intravascular coagulation, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis.
