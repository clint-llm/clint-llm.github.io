Laboratory investigations: Complete blood count, fasting blood sugar, lipid profile, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes, electrocardiogram (EKG),

Radiological investigation: The most appropriate initial investigation is an ultrasound plus doppler, which is a duplex scan to determine the blood flow and localize the clot. It also serves to determine the ankle-brachial pressure index, as described above.

Angiography: Computerized tomography (CT angio)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).
