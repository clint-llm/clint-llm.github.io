Organ and tissue-specific damage due to eosinophil dysfunction or hyperactivity occurs through a variety of methods. MBP is heavily involved in these processes. Four general mechanisms can describe the pathology seen in eosinophilic disorders

- **Eosinophilic infiltration:**Excessive accumulation of eosinophils in tissue can lead to tissue damage if there is extensive deposition. This condition may occur in eosinophilic types of pneumonia, for example.

- ****Allergic inflammation:****As previously mentioned, IL-5 is vital for its role in stimulating the differentiation and growth of eosinophils and for stimulating their recruitment to sites of inflammation. Th2 cells are highly associated with allergic conditions and can stimulate eosinophils directly or indirectly. Direct stimulation can occur with the Th2 release of IL-5. Indirect activation can occur with Th2 production of IgE, which can bind mast cells (type I hypersensitivity response). Release of mast cell contents, such as Il-5 and leukotrienes, can lead to further eosinophil activation and inflammation.

- **Fibrosis:**Eosinophils can cause fibrosis by releasing transforming growth factorβ, interleukin 4, and interleukin 13, leading to fibroblast activation and proliferation.

- **Thrombosis:**Eosinophil granular contents can induce a hypercoagulable state in certain diseases by activating platelets. MBP and EPO are potent platelet agonists.
