As stated above, the compartment of the muscles found in the femoral region are generally intrinsic to the function of the compartment The anterior thigh muscles generally induce flexion and adduction of the hip and extension of the knee. Medial thigh muscles as a rule produce adduction, flexion, and internal rotation of the hip. Posterior thigh muscles generally induce extension, abduction, and internal/external rotation of the hip and flexion of the knee.

- Anterior thigh – innervated by the femoral nerve (L2-4); pectineus, iliopsoas (psoas major, iliacus), and quadriceps femoris (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, vastus intermedius), sartorius*, tensor fasciae lata*

- Medial thigh – innervated by the obturator nerve (L2-L4); obturator externus*, adductor longus/brevis/magnus, gracilis

- Posterior thigh – divisions of the sciatic nerve (L4-S2); semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps femoris (long and short heads)

*Ssome exceptions to the general rules: sartorius flexes/abducts/externally rotates hip, tensor fasciae lata flexes/abducts hip, obturator externus externally rotates the hip.
