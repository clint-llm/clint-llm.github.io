The diagnosis and management of nurse maid's elbow requires an interprofessional team that includes a sports physician, primary care provider, emergency department physician, orthopedic surgeon, and a nurse practitioner.

Treatment involves closed reduction, and this can be performed in a few seconds without sedation.  Even though it is brief, it can be painful as the annular ligament reduces to its proper position. It should be explained to parents that the child will likely be upset, but that once the elbow is properly reduced, the pain should resolve and the child will likely be back to baseline within a few minutes.

If reduction was successful, no splinting or sling is necessary, and the prognosis is excellent. Because of possible recurrence, parents should be instructed to avoid activities that cause axial traction to the arm such as lifting, jerking or swinging the child by the hands, wrists or forearms.
