As mentioned above, while it is helpful to have at least one assistant nearby when placing a nasogastric tube, an experienced healthcare provider can generally place one by themselves without much difficulty. Where interprofessional care comes into play with nasogastric tubes is in maintaining them. Physicians should check that the nasogastric tube is functioning and not clogged or otherwise malfunctioning when they round. Nursing staff should also routinely inspect their patients' nasogastric tubes to ensure they are functioning and have a high index of suspicion for potential aspiration events. Frequent examinations by all healthcare providers to ensure the tube is securely in place and properly positioned can also reduce injuries associated with nasogastric tubes.
