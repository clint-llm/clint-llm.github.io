Drug-induced gingival overgrowth (DIGO), also referred to as drug-induced gingival enlargement, and previously known as drug-induced gingival hyperplasia, is a noted side-effect of certain drugs given for non-dental uses where the gingival tissue is not the intended target organ. The key offending drug classes are anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants and calcium channel blockers. This activity presents the causes, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of gingival overgrowth and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the types of drugs associated with gingival overgrowth.
- Review the pathophysiology of drug-induced gingival overgrowth.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for gingival overgrowth.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with gingival overgrowth.
