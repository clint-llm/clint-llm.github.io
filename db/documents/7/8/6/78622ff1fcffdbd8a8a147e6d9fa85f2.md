Successful embolization of a fistula results in thrombosis of the cavernous sinus over time although it can take weeks to months for closure to occur following radiosurgery. Symptoms including chemosis, proptosis, and cranial nerve deficitsÂ usually resolve within hours to days. Recovery of vision may depend on several factors including the flow of the fistula, the timing of the intervention, and evidence of ischemic injury of the optic nerve or retina. Recurrence of the CCF is rare, but patients can be followed up with a posttreatment angiogram to confirm the complete obliteration of the fistula.
