Most patients with MG have a near-normal life span with the current treatment modalities. Fifty years ago, the mortality rate was around 50% to 80% in myasthenic crisis, and now it has reduced substantially to 4.47%.

Various clinical and laboratory/imaging findings in MG also have a prognostic significance. Studies have shown the following:

- **Risk of secondary generalization:**This is associated with a late age of onset, high titers of anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody, and the presence of a thymoma. A recent study predicts this risk by the type of clinical symptoms at the time of presentation. The presence of both ptosis and diplopia at the onset has a higher likelihood of secondary generalization compared to ptosis or diplopia alone.

- **Risk of MG relapse:**Age of onset (<40 years), early thymectomy, and administration of prednisolone are found to be associated with reduced risk of relapse.
