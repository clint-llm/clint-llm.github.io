The success rate of anterolateral thigh flap transfer is higher than 95%, and the ALT flap has become a workhorse of reconstructive microsurgery, with broad indications for reconstructing defects from head to foot. The advantages of using the ALT flap include:

- Ease of harvest due to reliable anatomy

- Long and large calibre vascular pedicle

- Versatility in flap modification like flap thinning or harvesting of chimeric flaps, depending on the donor site requirement

- Ability to use as a sensate flap

- Little donor site morbidity

- The use of a two-team approach, which decreases operating time
