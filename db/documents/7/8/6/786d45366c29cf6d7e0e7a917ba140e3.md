White centered retinal hemorrhages are a nonspecific ophthalmologic finding seen in multiple systemic conditions of various etiologies.Â  Roth spots are seen on fundoscopic examination and tend to be located in the peripheral or posterior poles of the eyes. Retinal endothelial dysfunction appears to be a common thread among the diverse causes of white centered retinal hemorrhage. The differential diagnosis of Roth spots is vast and includes:

- Bacterial endocarditis

- Anemia/thrombocytopenia

- Collagen vascular disease

- Leukemia

- Hypertensive retinopathy

- Diabetic retinopathy

- Pre-eclampsia

- Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

- Anoxia

- Shaken baby syndrome
