The fallopian tubes lie on either side of the uterus and are divided into four segments which include:

- Infundibulum or fimbriated end overlying the ovary

- The thin-walled and wide ampulla, which varies in length and shape

- The narrow, straight and thin isthmus

- The intramural portion of the tube pierces the uterine wall and usually located on the superolateral segment of the uterine cavity.
