Analgesic nephropathy is chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis caused by chronic use of analgesics such as acetaminophen, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The presentation can be variable from asymptomatic hematuria, sterile pyuria, or proteinuria, to symptomatic anemia with features of chronic kidney disease or acute urinary tract infection. Hypertension, anemia, and impaired urinary concentration occur as renal insufficiency develops. This activity describes when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to evaluate it properly and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of analgesic nephropathy.
- Describe the modifiable risk factors associated with analgesic nephropathy.
- Explain how to investigate and manage a patient with analgesic nephropathy.
- Summarize an interprofessional team approach to provide effective treatment and prevention of analgesic nephropathy.
