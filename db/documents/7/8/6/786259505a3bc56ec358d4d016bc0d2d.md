The foramen of Winslow is an oddity for the anatomist. The foramen of Winslow is defined superiorly by the caudate lobe of the liver and dorsally by the inferior vena cava. The inferior portion is defined by the duodenum, with the hepatoduodenal ligament serving as the ventral border. The foramen of Winslow is the only natural communication between the greater peritoneal cavity and the lesser sac. Also known as the epiploic foramen or the omental foramen, this small window was described by Jacob Winslow in his 1732 publication, Exposition anatomique de la structure du corps humain. Born in Denmark, Winslow converted to Catholicism and became a naturalized French citizen. Along with William Cheselden in London and Alexander Monro in Edinburgh, Winslow is considered among the preeminent anatomists of his day. His publication is considered unique, in that it was based entirely on his objective observations and did not rely on the opinions of other anatomists. He eventually became a professor of anatomy at the prestigious Jardin du Roi in Paris. Furthermore, he was the first to describe the foramen spinosum at the base of the skull.
