Malignant hyperthermia is a rare, life-threatening disorder. Because of the high morbidity, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional healthcare team that includes a neurologist, intensivist, anesthesiologist, an internist, nursing staff, and a pharmacist. This interprofessional/collaborative approach willÂ improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
