The management of MVP is with an interprofessional team that includes a team of a cardiologist, cardiac nurse, primary care provider, and cardiac surgeon. Patients need to be educated that they have a benign disorder and the risk of complications is low. However, patients do need to be told about the symptoms of mitral regurgitation and endocarditis and when to present to the hospital.

Clinicians should educate patients that they should adopt a healthy lifestyle, not smoke, exercise regularly, and abstain from alcohol and caffeinated beverages.  For those who develop palpitations, a trial of beta-blockers may prove to be useful.

Follow-up is necessary as some patients may develop worsening mitral insufficiency and intolerable symptoms. These patients are best referred to a cardiac thoracic surgeon.

**Outcomes**

The majority of patients with MVP have a normal life expectancy. About 3-10% of patients will have a progression of the condition to severe mitral regurgitation. In general, patients over the age of 50 at diagnosis and normal left ventricular function have an excellent outcome, even if they do develop MR. Death is rare from MVP today. Even for those who undergo repair or replacement of the valve, the outcomes are good to excellent.
