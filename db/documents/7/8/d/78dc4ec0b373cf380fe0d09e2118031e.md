Sonographic assessment of the aorta is performed in real time B-mode imaging programmed with the abdominal settings. The curvilinear transducer is ideal given its lower frequency and deeper penetration. However, the phased array transducer can be employed as well. Occasionally, the linear probe can provide significant detail in thin individuals.
