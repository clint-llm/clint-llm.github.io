Lithium is not recommended in patients with renal impairment. It is also not recommended in patients with cardiovascular disease. Lithium causes reversible T wave changes and can unmask Brugada syndrome. A cardiology consult is necessary if a patient experiences unexplained palpitations and syncope. It is also not advisable to consider lithium for treatment in children under 12 years of age.

Lithium is not considered for treatment during pregnancy due to a 2 to 3 fold increase of significant congenital disabilities. Ebstein's anomaly is a cardiac defect in infants associated with lithium treatment during pregnancy. It is crucial to weigh the risks versus benefits of continuing a pregnant patient on lithium.
