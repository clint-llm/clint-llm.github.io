**Locations of Degradation**

Epinephrine and norepinephrine primarily get synthesized in sympathetic neurons or the adrenal medulla.

Within sympathetic neurons, the production of epinephrine and norepinephrine is in storage vesicles released on neuronal activation. While in storage, catecholamines can passively leak into the neuronal cytoplasm and undergo deamination by intracellular monoamine oxidase. Therefore, the initial step of catecholamine degradation mostly takes place inside the synthesizing cell. A smaller amount of deamination by MAO takes place in the extracellular space.

COMT, in contrast, is not contained within sympathetic nerve cells. Therefore, all steps in the degradation pathway that require COMT take place outside the neuron.

Dopamine gets produced byÂ several cell types, most commonly dopaminergic neurons in discrete areas of the brain and mesenteric organ cells. Dopamine metabolism and the formation of HVA occur in the extracellular space, most often before reaching the liver.

Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and all of their intermediate metabolites from degradation eventually travel to the liver, where they are extracted and converted to end product VMA, which ultimately gets eliminated by the kidneys. HVA, which typically forms outside the liver, also undergoes renal elimination by the kidneys and is generally excreted twice as fast as VMA.
