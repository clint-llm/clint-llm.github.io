Monitoring glucose levels consistently and with the same meter is preferred for most patients at home. The frequency of required glucose checks is dependent on the severity of DM and medications used. If a patient is on short-acting insulin (ex. aspart, lispro) with meals it is imperative that the patient checks their blood glucose levels with each meal to ensure they do not give themselves too much insulin in relation to their preprandial (before meal) glucose and their insulin dose.

In the hospital, patients may have their glucose levels checked more frequently based on their condition and reason for the hospital admission.

Patients should have their Hgb A1C levels checked every 3-12 months as determined by their prescribing provider. Ideal glucose controlÂ is considered an Hgb A1C near 7.0% and is dependent on multiple factors including age, symptoms, and ability to use medications.
