The suboccipital nerve may suffer injury in surgeries involving the posterior neck at the levels of C1 and C2. Surgeries involving the midline suboccipital approach, such as distal vertebral artery bypass or access to the fourth ventricle of the brain, and posterior approaches for cervical neck fusions may damage the suboccipital nerve.
