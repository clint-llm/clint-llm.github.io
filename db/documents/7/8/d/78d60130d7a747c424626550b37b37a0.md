Angioplasty with or without stenting is a nonsurgical procedure used to open clogged or narrow coronary arteries due to underlying atherosclerosis. The procedure involves introducing an inflatable balloon-tipped catheter through the skin in extremities and inflating the balloon once it traverses the stenosed arterial site. It pushes the atherosclerotic intraluminal plaque against the arterial wall and restores the luminal diameter. Thereby it normalizes the blood flow to the myocardium. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was formerly called angioplasty with stent and is the treatment of choice for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and spontaneous coronary artery perforation. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing angioplasty and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Contrast the indications for angioplasty without stent with the indications for percutaneous coronary intervention.
- Contrast the techniques for performing percutaneous coronary intervention via the femoral versus radial approaches.
- List the complications associated with angioplasty.
- Employ a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing angioplasty.
