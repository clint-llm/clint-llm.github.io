Medication packaging mostly affects the shelf life of a drug, which is determined by the physical and chemical stabilities of the product. Chemical stability is determined by how long the drug will continue to have 100 ± 5 % of the label claim potency and contain sufficiently low amounts of any degradation products. This stability is often the basis of the drug expiration date. Physical stability is associated with the drug’s appearance and action (i.e., dissolution). Moisture is a significant destabilizer of drugs; thus, care must be taken in package design to minimize moisture exposure to extend the shelf life of the pharmaceutical product.

Pharmaceutical packaging comprised of polymers to preserve a drug may have unintended consequences should the polymers from the package leach into the medication.

Pharmacy packaging inserts yield further obstacles in delivering quality patient care and obtaining medical adherence. With low health literacy rates and confusing jargon often used in patient pharmaceutical packing, many individuals have difficulty comprehending the patient prescription inserts. This lack of comprehension subsequently increases the risk of adverse events associated with taking the medication incorrectly or forgoing treatment due to misunderstanding.
