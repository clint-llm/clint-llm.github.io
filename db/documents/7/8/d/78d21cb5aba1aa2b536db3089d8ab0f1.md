IL-12 and IL-23 are cytokines that modulate lymphocyte function and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease.

IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine predominantly produced by dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, which causes the differentiation and activation of Th17. Both cytokines share a p40 subunit.
