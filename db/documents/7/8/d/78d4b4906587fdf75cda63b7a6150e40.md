Congenital bronchial atresia is a rare condition characterized by focal obliteration of a proximal segment of a bronchus. The apicoposterior segmental bronchus of the left upper lobe is the most reported lobe involved, which is followed by the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. Although a rare entity, bronchial atresia has been associated with other prenatal lung malformations including congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, bronchopulmonary sequestration, congenital lobar emphysema, and lesions of mixed pathology.
