- Overall, the prognosis and decremental trend in BMD levels is worse compared to the general at-risk osteoporosis population

- By 1 year after the index SCI, over 50% of these patients will have osteoporosis

- Over 80% of chronic SCI patients develop osteoporosis

- Clinical efficacy and response to anti-osteoporosis treatment in these patients is less predictable compared to post-menopausal ambulatory women

Also, note the following timeline for prognostic implications.

- Two weeks following SCI: the patient at risk for rapid decreases in BMD levels

- Sublesion level bone loss: approximately 4% per month reduction in BMD can be expected

- Trabecular BMD bone loss: approximately 40% by 2 years after SCI injury

- Beyond 2 to 5 years post-injury: Controversy remains in the literature concerning ongoing decremental BMD rates into perpetuity. Some reports suggest that bone loss plateaus after 3 to 5 years, while others demonstrate chronic decreases in BMD.
