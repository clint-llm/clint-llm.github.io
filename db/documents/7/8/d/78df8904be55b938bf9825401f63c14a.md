Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a form of atypical parkinsonian syndrome, also known as a Parkinson-plus disorder. It is an uncommon neurological disorder that can affect movement, gait, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, eye movements, mood, behavior, and cognition. When the condition was originally referenced in 1964, it was described as a constellation including supranuclear gaze palsy, progressive axial rigidity, pseudobulbar palsy, and mild dementia. Since this condition was originally described, different phenotypes have been characterized and linked to the severity of abnormal tau accumulation and neuronal loss in various brain regions. However, despite variable clinical presentation, neuropathologic features remain consistent among patients with this disease. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of progressive supranuclear palsy and reviews interprofessional teams' role in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe common presenting signs and symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy.
- Review the conditions that should be ruled out prior to making the diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy.
- Explain how the diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy is made. 
- Describe a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance for patients with progressive supranuclear palsy.
