Other entities that cause interstitial lung diseases, such as sarcoidosis and occupational disorders, must be considered. Acute viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 pneumonia, may also appear clinically and radiologically similar to acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease. Cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may cause diffuse alveolar and interstitial opacities with interlobular septal thickening that may simulate interstitial lung disease.
