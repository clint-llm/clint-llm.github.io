Morphine administration can occur through various vehicles. Its administration is most often via the following routes: orally (PO), intravenously (IV), epidural, and intrathecal. Oral formulations are available in both immediate and extended-release for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Pain that is more severe and not well controlled may be manageable with single or continuous doses of IV, epidural, and intrathecal formulations.
