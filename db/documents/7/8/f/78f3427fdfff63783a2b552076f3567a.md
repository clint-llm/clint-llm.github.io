The management of patients with Saturday night palsy is best accomplished with an interprofessional team approach. The initial provider to evaluate a patient with Saturday night palsy should ensure they are thoroughlyÂ evaluated to rule out alternative causes for a new-onset neurologic deficit. Furthermore, appropriate referral to a neurologist to plan for electromyography and additional diagnostic/therapeutic measures should be made. A referral to physical therapy should be made as well, and patients should be educated on supportive measures. There should be an established timeline in place to ensure that surgical intervention can be pursued early if deemed to be necessary, and appropriate surgical follow-up should ensue in these cases. Patients in all cases should be given realistic expectations in terms of the recovery process, which may not be as straightforward as expected or desired. [Level 5]
