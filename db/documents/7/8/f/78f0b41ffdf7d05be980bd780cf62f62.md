Although cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is predominantly associated with Hepatitis C virus infection, various specialties are involved in the management of these patients. Gastroenterologists play a role in initiating antiviral therapy along with monitoring the viral load for hepatitis C. Dermatologists are involved when a skin biopsy is needed. The pathologist also plays a role as he could suggest the diagnosis based on labs and biopsies. Rheumatologists are frequently involved in managing severe or resistant cases as they have more experience with immunosuppressive therapies. When cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is related to non-Hepatitis C infections, we need appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the infection, which may be acting as a trigger. Pharmacists help adjust the doses of medications based on renal function and in monitoring drug interactions. Patients can have complications like multiorgan failure, requiring critical care, and the nursing role is immense in taking care of these patients and in educating the families. Wound care is important as the patients frequently have nonhealing ulcers and gangrene when general surgeons help salvaging the limbs. Hematologists play a major role in treating hematologic malignancies and when complications like lymphoma arise. Primary care physicians play a major role in identifying the disease, as it frequently presents with common outpatient complaints like a purpuric rash, arthralgias, and neuropathic pain. They also play a key role as a mediator between the various specialties, while advocating for the patient and keeping them well-informed. [Level 5]
