Impairment can be due to intrinsic palsy (intrinsic minus hand) or intrinsic contracture (intrinsic plus hand). Trauma is the most frequent cause of intrinsic contracture, which can be associated with metacarpal fractures or increased edema and vascular impairment, as happens with compartment syndrome. This causes lead to adhesion formation and fibrosis of the intrinsic muscles and tendons.

Other causes of intrinsic contractures include neurologic or spastic hand secondary to an upper motor neuron syndrome (cerebrovascular accident, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease), rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and arthrogryposis.

Traumatic injury to the ulnar nerve is the most frequent cause of intrinsic palsy. Other causes include nervous entrapment along its path in the arm (compression neuropathy), compartment syndrome,  central nervous system diseases, rheumatoid diseases, Leprosy (Hansen disease), rheumatoid arthritis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and prolonged immobilization, failure to splint a crush-injured hand using intrinsic plus posture.
