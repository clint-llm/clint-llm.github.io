Obesity is one of the most common preventable diseases.

Obesity measurement can also be used to estimate morbidity and mortality. Body mass index (BMI) has been used to screen overweight and obese individuals. However, waist circumference is the best anthropometric indicator of visceral fat and a better predictor of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

Compared to the Body Mass Index (BMI), the Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) is a more specific and sensitive examination tool. The VAI is, therefore, a reliable indicator of increased patient risk for cardiometabolic diseases.

Obesity has inflammatory components, directly and indirectly, related to major chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and several types of cancer.

It is well-documented that obesity and its inflammatory markers have significant effects on hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. This review provides detailed insight into chronic inflammation, immune and hormonal disturbance related to the pathophysiology of obesity and their effects on chronic conditions.
