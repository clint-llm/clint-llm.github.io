There are currently no societal guidelines available to aid in the diagnosis and management of IVC thrombosis.  Multiple imaging modalities are potentially useful when IVC thrombosis is suspected. These include ultrasound, CT, MRI, and catheter venography.

IVC duplex ultrasound can be used to visualize a potential thrombus, but there are limitations to this modality. Overlying bowel gas and patient obesity may make visualization very difficult. Ultrasound should still be a consideration as an initial test, given the low-risk profile. Case studies have reported IVC thrombosis identification using ultrasound in the emergency department. Sonographic signs that indicate a potential thrombus include a monophasic waveform by doppler, a choppy sign indicating increased blood velocity, and an inability to compress the vessel.

Computer tomography (CT) can also be used to visualize the location of the thrombus. However, MRI is the most reliable technique for visualizing the presence and extent of the thrombus. Given the poor general availability and the high cost of MRI, it should not be the initial imaging choice. Direct catheter venography is the most common imaging technique to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.

Once the thrombus is diagnosed, there should be a consideration for imaging dedicated to potential complications from the IVC thrombus. Approximately 12% of patients diagnosed with an IVC thrombus will develop pulmonary emboli. Therefore, a dedicated CT angiogram of the thorax may be needed to evaluate for pulmonary emboli. If there is a concern for renal involvement, nuclear renal scanning can be used to assess for renal vascular compromise.
