Generally, C2 fracture treatment is quite successful. A retrospective study comparing posterior cervical fusion with either C2 pedicle or C2 translaminar screws found that breach of pedicle screws occurred more frequently. The same study determined that the 1-year durability of translaminar screws is inferior to pedicle screws for subaxial fusions but equally effective for axial fusions.
