Eosinophilic pneumonia affects the lung and is predominantly idiopathic. It requires interprofessional care and the involvement of more than one subspecialty. This patient-centered approach involving a primary care provider with a team of other health professionals, including a pulmonologist, physiotherapists, respiratory therapists, nurses, pharmacists, and support groups working together for the patient, plays a vital role in improving the quality of care in pneumonia patients. Critical care nurses monitor patients, administer treatment, and are crucial to team communication. Pharmacists counsel patients about the importance of compliance with glucocorticoids and educate them about the side effects. The timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial, especially in patients with an acute presentation, as left untreated, it can progress to respiratory failure. [Level 5]
