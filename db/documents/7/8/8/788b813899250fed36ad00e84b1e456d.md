The ultimate goal of the cochlea is to transform complex airborne vibrations into auditory neural impulses. The tonotopic map created by the spiral of the cochlea enables individuals to simultaneously interpret a vast amount of sounds through vibrations carried from the perilymph to the endolymph in the cochlear duct. The anatomy of the cochlea allows it to efficiently carry vibrations that are ultimately converted to electrical impulses and interpreted by the brain's auditory cortex.
