The blood supply to the spinal meninges comes primarily from the anterior and posterior spinal arteries. The single anterior spinal artery originates from the vertebral arteries, which each gives of collaterals that fuse and descend as the anterior spinal artery before becoming the basilar artery. The paired posterior spinal arteries also receive their blood supply from the vertebral arteries. Additional segmental medullary arteries also feed into these anterior and posterior spinal arteries via entrance points at the nerve roots, the largest being the artery of Adamkiewicz, which provides additional blood supply to the anterior spinal artery and is typically present between T9 and L2.

The venous drainage of the spinal meninges is through the internal and external vertebral venous plexuses. These form a complex and valve-less system of drainage that is continuous with the venous system of the brain and has drainage into the azygous venous system, the portal venous system, renal veins, and the superior and inferior vena cava, among others.
