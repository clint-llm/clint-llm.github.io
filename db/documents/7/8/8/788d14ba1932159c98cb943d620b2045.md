As discussed previously, a multidisciplinary team approach is critical for symptom management, surveillance, and family support. Consensus-based care recommendations for congenital and childhood-onset myotonic dystrophy type 1 published in 2019, and Consensus Statement on Standard of Care for Congenital Muscular Dystrophies, published in 2014 summarized the guidelines recommended inpatient care.

Future clinical trials include:

1 **Natural History:**Trial Readiness and Endpoint Assessment in Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy (TREAT_CDM): children with CDM between ages 0 and 15 will be enrolled, with visits at baseline and one year to evaluate physical and cognitive function and quality of life, to extend understanding of disease progression.

2 **Treatment:**Efficacy and Safety of Tideglusib in Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tideglusib versus placebo in the treatment of children and adolescents 6 to 16 years of age with congenital DM1. The outcome is a change in Clinician-Completed Congenital DM1 Rating Scale (CDM1-RS) after 22 weeks.
