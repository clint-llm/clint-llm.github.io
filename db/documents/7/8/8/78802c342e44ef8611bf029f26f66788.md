Western equine encephalitis is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by the western equine encephalitis virus, a member of the Togaviridae family of viruses. Most of the infections are subclinical, presenting as fever, chills, malaise, and myalgias, but some can progress to an acute inflammation of the meninges and brain parenchyma. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of western equine encephalitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mosquito species involved in the etiology of western equine encephalitis.
- Describe the patient history associated with western equine encephalitis.
- Summarize the use of CT and MRI in evaluating the neurological symptoms of those with western equine encephalitis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by western equine encephalitis.
