EMS providers play a central role in MCI and disaster response. There are many challenges to providing optimal care to patients and victims.  Large numbers of victims may need triage, stabilization, and evacuation. In the event of a CBRN attack, heavy protective gear may be necessary. EMS providers and responders to the scene must always prioritize the safety of oneself so that they are able to care for others. In certain circumstances, it is important to consider the future health effects and risks for those who participated in an MCI.
