Campylobacter bacteria is a motile, corkscrew-shaped gram-negative rod. They range in size from 0.5 to 5 microns in length by 0.2 to 0.9 microns in width. While there are dozens of species, 3 represent the main sources of human infection: Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari. C. jejuni is the most commonly implicated species.

Volunteer controlled studies have highlighted the relative virulence of Campylobacter. Infection with doses as low as 800 CFU can cause symptoms.
