Notalgia paresthetica is a chronic neuropathic dysesthesia of unknown etiology characterized by pruritus located on the medial border of the inferior scapula. The condition has been first described by the Russian neurologist Michail Astwazaturow in 1934 and is usually benign in nature.

Others state the anatomical angle of sensory nerve fiber penetration through the surrounding muscle is the cause. Notalgia paresthetica is typically seen in older females, is unilateral, and can last for months to years. There are no primary cutaneous lesions, only secondary changes due to chronic scratching. Diagnosis through history and physical is typically sufficient, but occasionally further imaging may be required. Treatment remains disappointing, and oral neurologic modulators, such as gabapentin, are reported to be the most efficacious therapy.
