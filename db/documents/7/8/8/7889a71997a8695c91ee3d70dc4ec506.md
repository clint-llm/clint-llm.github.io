Muscles have little to no effect on the spinal cord supply except in the case of minor anastomoses, as there is an extensive network of epidural arterial and minor vessels that supply the paraspinal musculature. These vessels are interconnected and anastomose with the subclavian arteries cranially and the lumbar/hypogastric arteries caudally. These anastomoses are especially useful in providing a minor collateral network that can supply some flow to the spinal cord in the occlusion of the larger routes.
