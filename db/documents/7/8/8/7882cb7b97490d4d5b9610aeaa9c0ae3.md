Romanowsky stains such as Wright-Giemsa are typically used in blood films to produce differential staining of blood components, with platelets staining blue.

Other stains may be needed to differentiate between different structures even when carrying out detailed electron microscopy assessment. The electron density of lysosomes and Î±-granules are very similar, but tests for the presence of lysosomal enzymes such as acid phosphatase staining and arylsulfatase localization can differentiate the two.
