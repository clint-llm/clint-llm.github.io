Because of theÂ distribution of opioid receptors both within and outside the nervous system, opioid analgesics produce a broad spectrum of adverse effects, including dysphoria, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, suppression of endocrine systems, cardiovascular disorders (e.g., bradycardia), convulsion, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and miosis. In addition to these, long-term use of opioid analgesia can produce tolerance and, in some cases, opioid-induced hyperalgesia and/or allodynia.

As mentioned above, opioids with serotonergic activity such as tramadol, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone, dextromethorphan, meperidine, codeine, and buprenorphine have the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when used with other agents with serotonergic activity.
