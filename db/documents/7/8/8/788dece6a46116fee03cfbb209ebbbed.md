The main contraindications to botulinum toxin injection are neuromuscular disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis), allergies to botulinum toxin constituents, active infection at injection sites, body dysmorphic disorder, pregnancy, and breastfeedingÂ can potentiate neuromuscular blockade. Therefore injection on patients taking these should be performed with caution.

The FDA, given the paucity of patient data, classifies botulinum toxin as a category C drug. There have been reports of women who were unaware they were pregnant and had received botulinum toxin injections without adverse fetal effects. Since botulinum toxin is not expected to enter the systemic circulation after administration, it should not cross the placental barrier, creating controversy over pregnancy as a contraindication. Until additional evidence supports its safety during pregnancy, botulinum toxin should not be offered to pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers.
