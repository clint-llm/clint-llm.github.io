A hypoestrogenic state may be part of natural physiological menopause or induced (secondary to surgical, radiation, or chemotherapy treatments). Premenopausal women may develop a temporary hypoestrogenic state while lactating. Other conditions, such as exposure to medications, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hypothalamic dysfunction, may also result in a hypoestrogenic state. Medications that may induce a hypoestrogenic state include Selective estrogen receptor modulators, Selective estrogen receptor degrader, and antigonadotropins.

Decreased estrogen levels lead to changes in the vaginal environment, which causes a shift in the normal flora. Typically there is a decrease in Lactobacillus spp. resulting in overgrowth of skin and rectal pathogens.
