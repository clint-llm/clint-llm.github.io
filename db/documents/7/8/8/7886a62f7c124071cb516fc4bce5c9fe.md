The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown, although some consider it to be an autoimmune condition.Stachybotrys chartarum.

Recurrent episodes of intra-alveolar hemorrhage attract macrophages to the alveoli, which digest the hemosiderin (iron component) found in hemoglobin, leading to an abnormal accumulation of hemosiderin-laden macrophages. This attracts more pro-inflammatory cytokines and causes chronic inflammation and thickening of the alveolar basement membrane. Ultimately this causes interstitial lung fibrosis with a restrictive picture on spirometry.
