Although the oral route (as a syrup) has been the standard mode of administration for the past several decades, it is also effective as a rectal enema.

At present, the most commonly used regimens of lactulose are as follows.

Oral Route:

For constipation, administration of 15-45 ml (or 10-30 gm) 2-4 times daily, until the formation of soft stools.

In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, lactulose is typically given in syrup form at a dose of 15 to 30 mL two to four times a day to aim for two semisoft stools per day.

For acute hepatic encephalopathy, a common option is to administer a bolus of 45 ml (30 gm) and repeat it hourly until the first bowel movement. Once the episode of encephalopathy has subsided, the dose can be titrated to achieve 2-3 soft bowel movements on a daily basis.

Rectal Route:

This mode is preferred if there exists any risk of aspiration via the oral route. The preferred route is to administer it as 300ml in 700ml of water and have it retained in the colon for an hour, repeated every 2 hours until the episode resolves. The patient position should be in the lateral recumbent position to optimize intestinal distribution.
