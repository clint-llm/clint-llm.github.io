It is important that before any nuclear medicine study is conducted, patients are educated on the procedure, the risks involved, and the preparation needed for the study. Nuclear medicine uses ionizing radiation from the radiotracers administered to the patient. The amount of radiation a patient receives depends on the study being conducted and what radiotracer is injected. If the effective dose of radiation is <0.1 mSv, then the dose is considered trivial. This includes studies of glomerular filtration rate, which use about .006 mSv of radiation. Studies like thyroid scans use about 0.14 mSv and are considered intermediate since the radiation dose is between 0.1 and 1 mSv. A dose between 1 and 10 mSv is considered intermediate. A nuclear bone scan uses about 4 mSv, placing it in the intermediate range.

Any dose of radiation above 10 mSv is considered moderate. Many therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures are in this category. For reference, the amount of radiation an average person receives in a day is about 3 mSv.

Adverse effects of radiotracers are very uncommon. One study found that out of 783,525 radiotracer injections, only 18 patients had an adverse reaction to the radiotracer. This equates to an incidence of 0.0023%.

Many different studies can be used for nuclear medicine, and patient education will differ depending on the type that needs to be completed. Common topics to educate patients on include avoiding taking certain medications. For some studies, patients should avoid eating food or drinking carbonated drinks before the procedure.
