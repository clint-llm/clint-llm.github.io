Patients with diastasis recti commonly present with a midline bulge with or without other symptoms. The indication for treatment of diastasis recti is based on patient perspective and complaint. These patients should be provided reassurance that there is not a true hernia or risk of complications. However, for patients who complain of bothersome symptoms and/or concerns about cosmesis, treatments should be offered and discussed, ranging from conservative management with exercises to surgery. Experts have a range of specific distances, which constitute diastasis recti. A generalization can be that a distance greater than 2 cm between the rectus abdominis muscles at the midline is considered abnormal.

Some experts measure different distances along the midline - for example, superior to the level of the umbilicus, at the level of the umbilicus, and inferior to the level of the umbilicus. Typically, there is a larger distance between the muscles superior to the umbilicus compared to inferior to the umbilicus, even in patients without diastasis recti. Overall, it may be recommended to focus on the patient's perspective of bothersome symptoms versus exact distances. These measurements can, however, be used to help monitor progress during and after treatment. To reiterate, treatment success is typically determined by patient satisfaction and improvement of symptoms rather than by a specific decrease in the distance.
