Management of the workplace focuses on prevention and de-escalation, with flight or fight as a last resort.

- De-escalationÂ may be applied as early as triage.

- Safe assessment rooms (SARs) have been shown to improve acutely agitated management, with most patients calming down within twenty minutes.

- Opportunities to diffuse tension, such as taking the patient to an available room earlier, should be seized.

- Staff should be trained in de-escalation. Risk is reduced when patients are approached calmly and efforts are made to connect.

- Efforts should be made to listen to the patient, acknowledge their concerns, and respectfully direct them to a goal; this process can be repeated as often as necessary to achieve the required results.

- Aggression management teams can be used if needed, and their presence can be enough to de-escalate further.

- Physical restraints, as an adjunct to chemical restraints, should also be used as a last resort.
