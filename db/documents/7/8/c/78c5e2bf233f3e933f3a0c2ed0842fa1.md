The hallmark of mitochondrial disease is an accumulation of mitochondria in muscle fibers visualized on Gomori trichrome stain. The diseased mitochondria proliferate in an attemptÂ to compensate for poor energy production and appear bright red compared to the blue myofibers, therefore called "ragged red fibers." MELAS also shows strongly succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-reactive blood vessels due to mitochondrial proliferation in perivascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells.
