The elimination half-life of lemborexant was 17 hours and 19 hours in 5 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Age, body mass index (BMI), race, or sex have no impact on the elimination half-life of the drug. There are no dosage adjustment recommendations in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, although patients with severe renal illness may experience excessive somnolence.

Compared to the more popular hypnotic drug zolpidem, lemborexant appears to exhibit far less potential for misuse. Patients who use it do not appear to be at risk for developing dependence or withdrawal symptoms. This characteristic may indicate that lemborexant may be a safer option for patients with a history of addiction or drug abuse. Nonetheless, lemborexant is a Schedule IV-controlled substance with sedative properties and should be used and prescribed with caution. Further research is warranted to investigate the abuse potential for lemborexant. Furthermore, lemborexant should be compared to commonly prescribed GABA agonists other than zolpidem, particularly hypnotic benzodiazepines, as current evidence suggests it may be a safer option.
