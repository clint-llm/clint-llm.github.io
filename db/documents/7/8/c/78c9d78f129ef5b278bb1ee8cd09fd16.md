The patient should undergo a thorough gynecologic examination. Once all infectious, inflammatory, hormonal, neoplastic, and neurologic causes are investigated and treated, a visual inspection of the vulva and vulvar vestibule should be performed.

- Cotton swab evaluation: Ask the patient, "Where does it hurt?" and, "Does it hurt before I even touch you?" From the outside in towards the vestibule, mark the area to find the location of the pain. Starting from the inner thigh, move to labia majora, inner labial sulcus, clitoris, and clitoral hood, perineum, and sites within the vestibule. The patient should rate their pain on a scale of 1 to 10.

- Neurosensory: Cotton versus pinprick exam in the same places - note whether it is normal, hyposensitive, sharp, burning, or shooting pain.

- Pelvic muscle exam: Starting with puborectalis and working way into the pelvic muscles.

- Evaluation of pain comorbidity: Interstitial cystitis, endometriosis, temporomandibular joint syndrome, chronic headaches.

- Assessment of factors contributing to pain: Emotional functioning, sleep interference, relationship problems, physical functioning, sexual functioning
