Presenting symptoms are often non-specific or are thought to be accounted for in the context of known sepsis or malignancy. A higher degree of suspicion should be maintained in children who present with symptoms suggestive of Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome. In adults, in which the disease is rarer, presentation is often obscured by another confirmed multi-organ system process such as malignancy, sepsis, or an autoimmune process. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in any patient who presents with multiorgan failure with associated cytopenias, coagulopathy, and failure to improve with standard treatment.
