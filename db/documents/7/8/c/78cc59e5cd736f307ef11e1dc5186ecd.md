Acute stress disorder (ASD) is a psychiatric disorder but still can have physiological manifestations (such as tachycardia) and abnormal fMRI. However, no validated laboratory or radiographic test exists. The diagnosis is clinical and is based on history and physical examination. Careful behavior observation and careful listening to the patient's narrative are of immense value. Many patients are unable to fully reflect their feelings and history in the initial evaluation session and will require additional visits.

There are validated and quick psychometric questionnaires available that can be used to evaluate ASD children and adults. The Child Stress Reaction Checklist (CSDC), for example, measures symptoms of ASD and PTSD that can be completed in ten minutes. CSDC can be used for children 2 to 18 years old.
