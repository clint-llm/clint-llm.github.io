The workup of aortic transection begins most often with a plain film chest x-ray. This is included in the standard trauma workup following the primary survey of the patient. On chest x-ray (CXR), findings that may indicate aortic pathology include a widened mediastinum, loss of the aortic knob contour, inferiorly displaced left bronchus, and left pleural effusion. Any chest x-ray with abnormal findings should be followed by helical imaging when clinically appropriate. The utility of a chest x-ray for aortic transection has been studied. The positive predictive value of widened mediastinum on CXR is only 5%, and the negative predictive value is 99%. Therefore, a widened mediastinum on x-ray may not represent aortic transection; however, its absence nearly confirms the lack of aortic pathology.
