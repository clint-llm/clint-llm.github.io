The patient's prognosis depends on the presenting visual acuity, the extent of ocular and systemic involvement, degree of subluxation of the lens, age of onset of ectopia lentis, and associated systemic complications. Traumatic ectopia lentis patients usually have a very poor visual outcome. Large-scale studies are still pending in the literature to assess the visual outcome and prognosis of ectopia lentis cases. As per previous studies, the majority of ectopia lentis cases achieve a best-corrected visual acuity of 6/12 or better.
