PAS-2 is an autoimmune disease affecting multiple endocrine organs.

PAS-2 is a polygenic disease, with significant heterogeneity due to multiple genetic loci and environmental factors responsible for the organ-specific damage. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes located on chromosome 6 have been implicated in organ-specific damage in PAS-2.[1] It appears that HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4 haplotypes and the class 2 HLA alleles DQ2 and DQ8 increase predisposition to PAS-2.

Non-HLA genes can also predispose to PAS-2 and include CD25-interleukin-2 receptor, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4), and protein tyrosine-protein phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22).
