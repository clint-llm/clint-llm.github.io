Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) is a rapidly destructive, non-communicable microbial disease of the gingiva in the context of an impaired host immune response. It is characterized by the sudden onset of inflammation, pain, and the presence of "punched-out" crater-like lesions of the papillary gingiva. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of acute necrotizing gingivitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. 
-  Review the management options for acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.
