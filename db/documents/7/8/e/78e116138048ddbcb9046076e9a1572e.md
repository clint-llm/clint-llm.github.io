Somnambulism is a common arousal disorder. However, the epidemiology of this disorderÂ is still ambiguous. The prevalence rate of sleepwalking is significantly higher in children than in adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Stallman and colleagues showed the estimated lifetime prevalence of sleepwalking is 6.9% without a significant difference in lifetime reports of sleepwalking between children and adults. The prevalence of sleepwalking, within the past 12 months, was reported significantly higher in children 5.0% compared to 1.5% in adults. This is likely related to less slow-wave sleep during adulthood, leading to fewer prospects for sleepwalking.
