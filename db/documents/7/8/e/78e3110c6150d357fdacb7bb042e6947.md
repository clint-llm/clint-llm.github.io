The pathogenesis of anaerobic infections includes disruption of the mucosal surface and entry of the anaerobic bacteria with the invasion of the deep tissue. The mechanisms of entry include local trauma, surgery, viscus perforation (for example, appendicitis), tissue necrosis, and impaired clearance of a sterile site (chronic sinusitis, pneumonia). The site and the extent of infection are based on the virulence factors of the organism and host immunity.

The virulence factors which assist anaerobic infections are adhesions factors (fimbriae and lectin), invasion factors (phospholipase C, lipopolysaccharides, and proteases), factors involved in tissue destruction (fibrinolysis, acetylglucosaminidase, and collagenase production), capsular resistance to phagocytosis, and others. Serious infections are seen in the immunocompromised host.

When implicated in an abscess, anaerobes are usually part of a polymicrobial infection. Experimental rat models with mixed infections have shown that the growth of anaerobes, as well as aerobes, is enhanced in polymicrobial infections.
