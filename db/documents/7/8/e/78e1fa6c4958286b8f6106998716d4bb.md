There may be a presumptive diagnosis of cat scratch disease, given the correct historical and examination findings. B. henselaeÂ is difficult to culture. Exposure to cats is usually necessary for diagnosis. Serologic testing may confirm the diagnosis with EIA or IFA; however, negative serologic tests do not rule out the diagnosis. Lymph node biopsy is not indicated routinely but should be considered if the diagnosis is unclear. Historically, excision of affected lymph nodes has been avoided for fear of the development of fistulas. Ultrasound may aid needle aspiration to obtain tissue.
