The risk for antihistamine toxicity results from ingestion of unintentional toxic doses or attempted suicide mostly occurs in two categories: pediatric patients or older patients.Â In the former group, antihistamines can be commonly excessively administrated due to their therapeutic sedative properties and worldwide availability. The elderly are more susceptible to their anticholinergic and sedative properties.
