The key to managing sexually transmitted infections is to have an open dialogue with the patient regarding their sexual history, current practices, risk factors, and follow-up. Establishing a good relationship creates a neutral environment and optimizes the treatment course. Avoid shaming or judging a person's sexual history or practices because this can lead to patients' reservations about discussing their general and sexual health openly. It will also make it far less likely that they will return for necessary follow-up.

Whether a patient is seen in the emergency department or a primary care office, the patient's disposition should be determined solely by the clinical presentation. If the patient has a complicated systemic infection, admission is most likely warranted, but if they have a self-limiting complaint that can be easily treated with proper follow-up, the patient can be discharged home. Pitfalls a physician may encounter would most likely be limited education or familiarity with the newest guidelines on prevention and treatment, as well as limited local resources for their patient population.
