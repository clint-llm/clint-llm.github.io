**Medical Management**

The primary objectives for managing blind loop syndrome are to reduce bacterial overload, correct related deficiencies, and manage unwanted symptoms. Historically, the standard of care for bacterial eradication has been a single course of empiric antibiotics. In the past, physicians routinely prescribed one of the tetracyclines, as they have strong anaerobic coverage. While effective, recent studies have shown improved efficacy in alternative therapies, namely rifaximin and metronidazole.

**Surgical Management**

Surgical intervention is an option for blind loops with anatomic etiologies. It can also benefit patients with refractory cases requiring multiple rounds of antibiotics. The intended goal of surgery is to address the underlying defect, resect blind loops with significant hypertrophy, and re-establish a functional gastrointestinal tract. If a stricture and non-functional loop are present, then stricturoplasty or resection is indicated. In the case of anastomotic blind loop syndrome, the blind loop should be resected, and the anastomosis remade. In patients who develop stagnancy after undergoing a Billroth II, there is evidence of success in converting it to a Billroth I; in this instance, the duodenum is involved and should not be resected.

**Nutritional Care**

The purpose of nutritional care is to prevent negative outcomes by correcting underlying deficiencies. Nourishment is especially critical in those with considerable weight loss. While individual needs may vary, nutritionists generally recommend a high-calorie, low-fat diet. Depending on the extent of disease progression, patients may also require supplementation in the form of intramuscular B12, oral vitamins, or minerals. Ultimately, it is also the physician’s role to counsel patients with acquired lactase deficiencies.
