Because folinic acid administration is usually in combination with chemotherapy agents, it is challenging to discern causative relationships between folinic acid and adverse effects. The most commonly reported adverse reactions to folinic acid include GI upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), leukopenia, alopecia, and stomatitis. Other adverse outcomes include erythema, pruritus, skin rash, and urticaria.

Hypocalcemia can result in patients being treated with folinic acid. Studies suggest that there is evidence of decreased vitamin D levels in such patients, which may contribute to hypocalcemia. Thus, there is a recommendation for calcium monitoring and appropriate supplementation as needed.

Gastrointestinal complications are found to be more frequent and severe, with the addition of folinic acid to 5-FU therapy, particularly in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Patients treated with folinic acid in conjunction with 5-FU were found to have a higher incidence of stomatitis and diarrhea than patients treated with 5-FU alone. Â Patients who experience gastrointestinal side effects should not receive further combination treatment until GI toxicity resolves, regardless of severity. It merits noting that patients with GI toxicity, in particular, diarrhea, have the capability of deteriorating rapidly. These patients should be monitored closely, especially older patients or debilitated ones.

Although rare, anaphylactic reactions are possible following the administration of folinic acid.
