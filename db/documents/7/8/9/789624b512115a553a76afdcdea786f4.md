An understanding of the physiology of swallowing plays a crucial role in helping the clinician to determine the cause of dysphagia. Anatomical, functional, and iatrogenic causes affecting any of the stages of swallowing can lead to dysphagia. Some of the complications of dysphagia include the consequences of the inability to eat, such as nutrient deficiency and dehydration, as well as increased risk choking and aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of lodged food.

While clinicians can use a variety of studies to aid in the diagnoses of dysphagia, such as barium swallow, electromyography, and endoscopy, a detailed history can diagnose the cause of dysphagia 80% of the time.

**Anatomical**

These can include obstructive pathology in the pharynx or esophagus, such as strictures or sphincters. Reflux is among the most common causes of strictures in the esophagus. Treatment involves balloon dilation and proton-pump inhibition to prevent a recurrence. A Zenker diverticulum is due to an outpouching of a weakened muscular wall in the posterior hypopharynx. Food can be held in this pouch and regurgitated, leading to aspiration and foul breath. The clinician must also be aware of malignancies, both inside and outside, of the alimentary pathway that can contribute to obstruction. These often present with a more rapid progression of dysphagia and other associated symptoms such as weight loss.

Developmental errors such as cleft palate and lip affect the oral phase, disrupting the sucking reflex and increasing nasal regurgitation and the incidence of sinus infections. Other congenital issues include esophageal atresia. These are repaired surgically early in life to prevent infections and promote normal feeding development.

**Iatrogenic**

Iatrogenic causes of dysphagia remains an important consideration. Surgeries involving the tongue, vocal cords, pharynx, and other surrounding structures that directly damage the swallowing mechanism or compromise airway protection may require temporary or permanent alternative nutrition solutions as patients undergoing rehabilitation. Also, radiation can cause stenosis and stricture formation. Physicians should also be aware of medications such as doxycycline, alendronate, and NSAIDs that can cause pill esophagitis, which often presents with an acute sensation of chest pain. Patients should have the medications stopped to prevent further injury, or if stopping the drug is not an option, switched to an alternative less caustic formulation.

**Functional**

The primary neurological causes of dysphagia include strokes, tumors, and inherited neurogenic diseases such as cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or other neurologic processes. Weak or uncoordinated muscle activity can lead to impaired bolus transport and aspiration. Developmental delays can also present with swallowing difficulties as communication is often impaired. Patients can undergo dysphagia rehabilitation to strengthen and improve the coordination of the swallowing muscles. In severe cases, feeding tubes may be necessary to maintain adequate nutrition

Esophageal dysfunction is relatively common with a variety of causes. A physical exam should look for connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma and CREST syndrome. Achalasia is due to the inability of the LES to relax and can cause dysphagia to both solids and liquids. Dysfunction can also occur in the UES due to the impaired opening of the cricopharyngeus. Dysmotility or spasms can affect the peristaltic movement within the esophagus, leading to intermittent dysphagia. Treatment options include medications that aid in relaxing the muscles and myotomy, which involves a small cut in the sphincter to weaken the tonic contraction.
