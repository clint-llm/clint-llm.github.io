A common potential problem with the paramedian forehead flap is postoperative bleeding, particularly in the first 48 hours. This most often arises from the proximal aspect of the flap pedicle and glabella, areas rich in vascularity. Expertise is required in hemostasis and bandaging to minimize the risk of this occurrence. Careful, precise electrocoagulation must be performed at the end of the procedure. Then, hemostatic agents such as cellulose gel mesh and/or Monsel's ferric subsulfate solution can be applied to the proximal pedicle of the flap. An absorbent dressing under moderate--not excessive--pressure is then applied over the flap, and over the proximal aspect in particular. While this dressing may remain in place for one week, it is often prudent to have the patient return within 48 hours for dressing change and evaluation of the surgical site. After this period of time, there is much less chance of postoperative bleeding or complication.
