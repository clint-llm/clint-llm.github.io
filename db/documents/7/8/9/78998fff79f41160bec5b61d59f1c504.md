- Patients suffering from both primary and secondary erythromelalgia should receive proper education on the etiology of the disease. Thorough screening and evaluation to rule out myeloproliferative disorders found to be associated with secondary erythromelalgia is a crucial component to the management and prompt diagnosis of underlying disease processes.

- Regular follow-up is required to assess the efficacy of the treatment. Patients should also have their complete blood count with differential done yearly to monitor the development of the myeloproliferative disorder.
