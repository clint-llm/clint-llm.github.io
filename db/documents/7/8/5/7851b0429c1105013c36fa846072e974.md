Various genes implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital aniridia include:

Aniridia 1 or AN1 (OMIM **#**106210)- This results from heterozygous mutation of the PAX6 gene at chromosome 11p13. It is inherited autosomal dominantly, and also includes late-onset corneal dystrophy and congenital cataracts. Other associations include Peters anomaly, reduced smell sensation, hypoplasia of corpus callosum and/or anterior commissure, and the absence of the pineal gland.

Aniridia 2 (AN2) (OMIM **#**617141, autosomal dominant) results from the mutation of a cis-regulatory element of the PAX6 gene. This regulatory region is at the intron of the adjacent ELP4 gene (11p13).

Aniridia 3 (AN3) (OMIM **#**617142, autosomal dominant) is due to a mutation in the TRIM44 gene (11p13).

Gillespie syndrome (OMIM **#**206700) occurs due to a mutation of the ITPR1 gene at chromosome 3p26.1.

Research has suggested a probable linkage of autosomal dominant aniridia and acid phosphatase 1 (ACP1) at chromosome 2p.
