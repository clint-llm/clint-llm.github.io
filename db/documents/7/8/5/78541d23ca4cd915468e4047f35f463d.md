The etiology of TMD is mildly understood, but it is believed to be multifactorial; the appropriate management of the condition requires recognizing the predisposing and contributing factors.

Myofascial and intraarticular TMDs differ in their etiological factors. As the name implies, a myofascial disorder means that the muscles â€“ in this case, the ones involved in mastication - are affected, becoming tensioned, fatigued, and painful. Several factors are linked to muscular dysfunction, including stress, parafunctional habits like bruxism and abnormal posture, psychological conditions like depression and anxiety, and autoimmune diseases.

Intraarticular disorders refer to inflammatory or mechanical factors that affect the joint itself, articular disc displacement being the most common.
