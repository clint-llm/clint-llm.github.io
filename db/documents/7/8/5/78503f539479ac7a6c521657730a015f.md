The most common age group affected by perianal streptococcal dermatitis are patients between the ages of 6 months and 10 years old. Males are more commonly affected than females with a ratio between 3 to 1 and 2 to 1. Interestingly, patients are more commonly affected in the winter and spring months. While perianal streptococcal dermatitis is typically thought to be a pediatric disease, there have been case reports in adults.
