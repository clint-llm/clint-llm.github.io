**Electrolyte Derangements**

**Hyponatremia**

Monitor serum sodium regularly. This is more of a risk when using hypotonic solutions. Many patients admitted to the hospital have risks of baseline elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release leading to volume retention and worsening hyponatremia.

**Hyperkalemia**

Patients with renal failure who receive a potassium-containing solution might not handle clearing the potassium load and develop life-threatening hyperkalemia causing cardiac arrhythmias.

**Volume Overload**

Monitor for peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, or hepatomegaly. It is important to consider underlying cardiac dysfunction or renal failure and adjust volumes of administration accordingly. These patients might require a lower maintenance fluid rate than expected for their body weight.

**Metabolic Acidosis**

Normal saline is a slightly acidic solution relative to normal body pH. This can precipitate metabolic acidosis.
