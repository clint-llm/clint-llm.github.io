The most dangerous complications include exercise-induced life-threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or marked bradycardia), orthopedic injury, hemodynamic instability, or acute myocardial infarction, all requiring immediate medical assessment and subsequent treatment. Other complications include arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, syncope (including vasovagal syncope), stroke, or transient ischemic attack.
