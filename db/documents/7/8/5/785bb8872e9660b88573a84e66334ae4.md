Various distal radius fractures can have similar clinical presentations and may appear radiographically similar to the Barton fracture.

- The **reverse Barton fracture**is an articular fracture of the distal radius with dislocation in which the articular surface of the radius remains in contact with the carpus; however, the reverse type involves the volar portion rather than the dorsal aspect of the radius.

- The **Colles fracture**is a fracture of the distal radius with dorsal angulation/displacement; the key differentiating finding is the lack of intraarticular extension.

- The **Smith fracture**can be thought of as a reverse Colles fracture with volar rather than dorsal angulation.

- The **die-punch fracture**is a fracture of the articular surface of the radius with depression of the lunate facet.

- The **Chaufferâ€™s fracture**is an avulsion fracture of the radial styloid.
