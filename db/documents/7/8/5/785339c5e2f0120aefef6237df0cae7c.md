Plastic surgeons are always involved in breast reconstruction.  However, they must work very closely with the oncologic breast surgeon to determine the best treatment path for the patient.  For free flaps, the skin incision/excision is typically planned by both teams so that the resection can be oncologic, but also as cosmetically sensitive as possible. Other specialists including radiation oncologists and medical oncologists are also part of the patient's care team and plans for chemotherapy and radiation impact reconstruction timing and choice.  Patients with very complex diagnoses are frequently discussed at an interprofessional tumor board to determine their best options.  It is also necessary to have an excellent nursing team who are specialty trained to monitor free flaps and can alert the plastic surgeon immediately if there is a problem.  The interprofessional approach is the best means by which to increase optimal patient care and satisfaction, as well as minimizing risks and complications.
