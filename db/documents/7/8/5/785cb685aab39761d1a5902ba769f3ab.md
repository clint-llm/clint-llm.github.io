The correlation between malignancy and thrombosis has been reported as early as 1823. Multiple published accounts show an increased risk of VTE in patients with malignancy with prevalence as high as 20%. A large case-control study in the Netherlands examined 3220 patients aged 18 to 70; the study found the overall risk of venous thrombosis to be 7-fold higher in patients with malignancy, the highest risk was in the first few months after diagnosis with the highest risk increase seen in patients with hematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, or with distant metastases.

Cancer patients also face an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism. In a large retrospective study with 279,719 pairs of cancer patients and matched controls, the 6-month incidence of myocardial infarction was 2.0% in cancer patients compared to 0.7% in control patients, while for ischemic stroke, the incidence was 3.0% for cancer patients compared to 1.6% for control patients. The study also found that cancer patients experiencing arterial thromboembolism had a poor prognosis, with a 3-fold increased hazard for death.
