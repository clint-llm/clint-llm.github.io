Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter that plays a role in several complex biological functions.

Serotonin forms from the hydroxylation (i.e., the addition of -OH group) and decarboxylation of the tryptophan amino acid. The highest concentration of serotonin is in the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract, with small amounts in the central nervous system and platelets. Serotonin induces changes in the cell by its action on the serotonergic receptors, which are coupled to different G proteins mediating intracellular changes.

The biological function of serotonin plays several roles in the human body, such as influencing learning, memory, happiness, and reward, as well as physiological processes such asÂ regulation of sleep, behavior, and appetite.
