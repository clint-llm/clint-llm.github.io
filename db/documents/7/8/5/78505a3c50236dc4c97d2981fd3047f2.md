Thyroid development begins in the 2 to 3 weeks of gestation and starts as a median outgrowth from the primitive pharynx. The thyroid primordium originates at the foramen caecum, which is the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior one-third of the tongue.

From this point onwards, the thyroid then descends to the neck, passing anteriorly and closely to the developing hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage, finally reaching its final position in the inferior pre-tracheal neck by the seventh week of gestation. The distal part of the thyroglossal duct differentiates into the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland in 50% of the cases, while the thyroid gland is forming itself. The rest of the duct is, supposedly, expected to obliterate by the tenth week of gestation. If any part of the thyroglossal duct persists after the tenth week of gestation, a rise in the probability of pathology occurs. The persistence of any portion of the thyroglossal duct becomes the gateway to the formation of the thyroglossal duct cyst. If given enough development to the pathology, it can even cause thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma.
