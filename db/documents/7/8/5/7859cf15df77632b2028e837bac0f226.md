Galactocele is an encysted collection of milk products lined by flattened cuboidal epithelium. The presence of milk is confirmed chemically by a positive mucic acid test. On histopathology, dilated anastomosing channels are seen, lined by cuboidal epithelium, often with secretory activity. Sometimes, adjacent tissue may show evidence of adjacent pressure necrosis or the presence of foamy macrophages and chronic inflammatory changes if cyst contents leak into adjacent tissues.
