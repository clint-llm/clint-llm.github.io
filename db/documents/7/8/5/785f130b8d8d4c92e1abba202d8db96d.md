Myoclonic epilepsy of Infancy has an excellent response to anti-seizure drugs (ASDs). Sodium valproate (valproic acid) is the drug of choice and 80% of patients started on valproate become seizure-free. Clonazepam and levetiracetam are alternative drugs for MEI.

Other forms of myoclonic epilepsy discussed under differential diagnosis are challenging to treat. The primary treatment modalities for West syndrome are ACTH/corticosteroids or vigabatrin. Clobazam, sodium valproate, and zonisamide may be second-line drugs. First-line medications for Dravet syndrome (DS) are a combination of ASD (clobazam and valproic acid), and second-line management includes stiripentol, topiramate, fenfluramine, ketogenic diet, or vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).

ASDs such as felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, and rufinamide have been tried for seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS). The FDA has approved cannabidiol (CBD)oral solution to treat seizures associated with LGS or Dravet Syndrome in patients aged two years and older.
