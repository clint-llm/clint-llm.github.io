Sulindac is a non-selective COX (cyclooxygenase) inhibitor that reversibly inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. The COX pathways are one of the two main pathways involved in arachidonic acid metabolism (the other involves leukotriene synthesis). The COX pathway results in the synthesis of both prostaglandins and thromboxanes. These are both critical mediators of inflammation and platelet aggregation.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is often a trigger of the cardinal signs of inflammation: rubor (erythema), calor (warmth), tumor (swelling), and dolor (pain)- this is accomplished through increased blood flow and vascular permeability. PGE2 also triggers systemic fever through a hypothalamic-mediated reaction. Sulindac and other NSAIDs are responsible for inhibiting the synthesis of this prostaglandin and others. Sulindac exists as a pro-drug that activates upon initial metabolism. Its metabolism forms both sulfide and sulfone derivatives; the sulfide derivative is the one that is responsible for inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Sulindac tablets have a similar extent of absorption compared to sulindac solution.Â There is no information regarding food's effect on sulindac absorption. Antacids containing aluminum hydroxide 225 mg and magnesium hydroxide 200 mg per 5 mL do not change absorption extent.

**Distribution:**Sulindac, sulfone, and sulfide metabolites are highly protein bound (more than 90%), mainly to albumin.

**Metabolism:**Sulindac goes through two major biotransformations of its sulfoxide moiety: reduction to the pharmacologically active sulfide metabolite and oxidation to the inactive sulfone metabolite.

**Elimination:**Approximately half of the administered dose of sulindac is eliminated through urine with the conjugated sulfone metabolite. Approximately 25% of the administered dose of sulindac is excreted in the feces, the majority as the sulfone or sulfide metabolites. The mean plasma effective half-life for sulindac and its active sulfide metabolite is 7.8 hours and 16.4 hours, respectively.
