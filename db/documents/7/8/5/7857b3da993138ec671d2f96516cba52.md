An infectious substance is any material that can cause disease in humans or animals; therefore, proper packaging and shipping of such materials are paramount, as mismanagement places lab personnel at risk and is a potential public safety and environmental hazard.

Handling infectious substances requires all involved parties to undergo hazmat training and follow hazardous materials regulations. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the United Nations, in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), play essential roles in regulating the transportation of infectious materials. In 2006, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, a government agency of the U.S. DOT, updated the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) by establishing a classification system adapted from criteria created by the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other professionals and experts knowledgeable in this area. The system divided infectious substances into two categories, category A and category B, to ultimately determine the packaging and transportation requirements of a material.
