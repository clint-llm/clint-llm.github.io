Major complications associated with CRT device implantation include:

- **Access site bleeding and pocket hematoma**: The incidence in clinical trials is reported up to 2.5%.

- **Lead dislodgement**: CRT trials demonstrated a rate of lead dislodgement from 2.9% to 10%.The incidence of left ventricular lead dislodgement is higher than that of the right atrial and right ventricular lead.

- **Infection**: It is one of the challenging complications related to CRT and other cardiac implantable devices. The incidence of device-related infection for CRT implantation is reported up to 3.3%. Male gender, prior device-related infection, and re-implantation are reported to have a higher incidence of device-related infections.

- **Pneumothorax**: It is a rare complication, reported up to 0.66% in cardiac pacing device implantation. Subclavian access, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease advanced age (>80 years) at implantation are reported with a higher pneumothorax incidence. The cephalic vein cut-down technique should be used whenever possible to avoid this complication.

- **Coronary sinus perforation****/dissection**: Coronary venous dissection is a rare but known complication of left ventricular lead placement during implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy device. It is reported up to 0.28% and reported to prolong post-procedural hospital stay.

Other complications may include cardiac tamponade, myocardial injury, lead fracture, pocket erosion, and phrenic nerve stimulation. Inappropriate phrenic nerve stimulation occurs in up to 13% of the patients undergoing left ventricular lead placement and is more common at mid-lateral, mid-posterior and apical sites.
