The mainstay of treatment is recognition and discontinuation of the offending drug. Development of positive ANA alone after receiving a drug shall not be a reason for discontinuation of the drug, although these patients shall be closely monitored for the development of DIL. Symptoms of DIL usually resolve within a few weeks of discontinuation of the medication, although rarely, they may last several months. NSAIDs or low dose corticosteroids may be considered for milder manifestations, with high dose corticosteroids reserved for more serious manifestations such as symptomatic pericardial effusion.  As noted above, even though the symptoms of DIL resolve within few weeks of drug discontinuation, the autoantibodies can stay positive for several months to years, and their presence alone shall be a reason to use anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy.
