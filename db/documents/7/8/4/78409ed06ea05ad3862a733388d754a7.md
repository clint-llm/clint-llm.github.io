The pharmacist should educate the patient on the best medications to manage the headache. In addition, nausea and vomiting also require treatment. Patients need to understand that compliance with these agents is needed for the resolution of the headache. Because the headache is difficult to manage once it has started, prevention is key. The pharmacist and the primary care clinician should encourage the patient to make changes in lifestyle and avoid the triggers. A headache journal should be kept to track the symptoms and triggers. A healthy diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, and stress relief can lower the risk of basilar migraine. Even setting a mealtime is necessary as skipping meals can trigger a basilar migraine. Finally, patients need to be educated that reliance on natural substances and herbs may not be wise as there is little evidence that these products can produce pain relief.
