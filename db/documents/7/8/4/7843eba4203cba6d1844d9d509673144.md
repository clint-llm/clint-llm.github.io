Lurasidone is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic. It was initially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia. In 2009 the manufacturer decided to pursue approval for the treatment of bipolar depression by establishing the lurasidone bipolar program (PREVAIL). The goal was to determine a safe and effective medication for bipolar depression. Based on the results of this program, lurasidone received FDA approval for the treatment of bipolar depression in June 2013; this was a significant innovation becauseÂ lurasidone was the first drug approved both as a monotherapy and as an adjunctive to lithium or valproate.

In January 2017, lurasidone received FDA approval for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents. In March 2018, the FDA expanded the usage to include pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) to treat major depressive episodes associated with bipolar depression.

Lurasidone is sometimes used off-label to treat bipolar mania and irritability, and anger in autism spectrum disorder.
