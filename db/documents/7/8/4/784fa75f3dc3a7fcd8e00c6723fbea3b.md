Serum blood glucose level via bedside finger-stick testing should be the first test for patients with neurologic deficits. This is to help identify and correct hypoglycemia if it is present.

Emergent non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head is one of the first diagnostic tests obtained in patients suspected of having a stroke. This test will identify hemorrhagic stroke if it is present.

The non-contrast CT may not readily identify ischemic strokes. Patients will usually undergo further neurologic imaging immediately after obtaining a noncontact CT. This imaging may include specialized contrast CT imaging to evaluate brain perfusion and/or contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the head and neck to identify any blocked vessels.

Cardiac monitoring with bedside telemetry and electrocardiograms is obtained in all patients with stroke-like symptoms.

Additional testing will include serum troponin, complete blood count with differential, lipid profile, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood urine nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In younger patients presenting with stroke symptoms, other labs that might be ordered include a coagulation panel, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), and other markers for vasculitis.

In some cases, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be obtained to rule out a post-seizure state.
