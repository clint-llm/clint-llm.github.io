The diagnosis of spontaneous pneumothorax is often suggested by the patient’s history and physical exam findings, which can be confirmed by imaging. Chest radiography characteristically shows the displacement of the visceral pleural line with a space devoid of lung markings in between. While upright films are preferred, there is evidence that expiration does not necessarily increase the diagnostic yield. Ultrasound has also shown diagnostic potential. There is evidence that ultrasound has greater sensitivity than chest radiography; however, both modalities are limited in how well they estimate the size of a pneumothorax. The use of chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of spontaneous pneumothorax has been debated. The high sensitivity and specificity of CT can be of value when there is a high index of suspicion for spontaneous pneumothorax, and initial imaging is negative or equivocal. While arterial-blood gas measurements are not necessary for a diagnosis of spontaneous pneumothorax, they can be useful in assessing acute respiratory alkalosis and increases in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient when tension physiology is present.
