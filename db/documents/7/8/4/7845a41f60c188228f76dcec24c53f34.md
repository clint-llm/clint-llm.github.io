Potential complications of CPET include fatigue and shortness of breath and are often related to the patient's exercise tolerance. Less common complications include cardiac arrhythmias, anginal chest pain, and bronchospasm. Given the potential for more side effects in certain patient populations, such as those with heart failure, it is desirable to perform the test in the hospital setting under the supervision of a physician.
