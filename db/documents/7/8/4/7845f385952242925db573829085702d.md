Due to an increase in invasive medical procedures, the incidence of gas embolism has been steadily increasing. Additionally, the use of end-tidal carbon dioxide and doppler monitoring has lead to an increase in gas embolus detection. The actual incidence is unknown, however, because most venous gas emboli are largely subclinical and do not result in any obvious symptoms in patients. Neurosurgical procedures have the highest risk of a venous gas embolus due to the patient being upright, the position of the brain relative to the heart, and the brain's noncompressed venous system.
