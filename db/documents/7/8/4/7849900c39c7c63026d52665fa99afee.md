Myxedema coma is a rare fatal condition resulting from long-standing hypothyroidism with loss of the adaptive mechanism to maintain homeostasis. Hypothyroidism due to any cause, including autoimmune disease, iodine deficiency, congenital abnormalities, or medications like lithium and amiodarone, can precipitate myxedema coma if left untreated. Even with early diagnosis and treatment of myxedema coma, the mortality rate is variable, with some reports as high as 60% and others as low as 20 to 25% in the presence of advanced intensive support care. Early recognition, a thorough history, physical exam, and early treatment are paramount in managing myxedema coma. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of myxedema and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the history and physical exam of a patient with myxedema coma.
- Identify the etiology of myxedema coma.
- Outline the management options available for myxedema coma.
- Review the importance of an interprofessional team for improving outcomes of myxedema coma.
