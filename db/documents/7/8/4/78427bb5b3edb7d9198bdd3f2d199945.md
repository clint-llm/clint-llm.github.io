Madelung deformity is more common in women, with a ratio of approximately 4 to 1 female to male.

Patients typically present between 8 and 14 years old. Because Madelung deformity is due to growth plate tethering, the deformity increases in severity during growth and then remains stable at skeletal maturity. Pediatric hand deformities are present in 1 to 2% of the general population. Madelung deformity is relatively rare, with a prevalence of less than 2% of pediatric hand deformities, therefore less than 0.03% of the population.
