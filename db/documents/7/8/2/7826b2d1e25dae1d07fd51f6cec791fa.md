Neurological complications associated with holoprosencephaly include epilepsy with or without clinically evident seizure activity, motor impairment such as hypotonia and dystonia, with or without spasticity.

Gastrointestinal tract anomalies like poor gastric and colonic motility and gastroesophageal reflux are a result of poor neuronal migration during development.

Additionally, the hypothalamus being a midline structure is unformed in these patients. Non-formation of the hypothalamus is associated with various endocrinal symptoms due to pituitary hormone deficiency, along with impaired homeostatic functions like thirst, hunger, and temperature. Hormone irregularities of the posterior pituitary are far more common than those of the anterior pituitary. Patients must be screened repeatedly for electrolyte levels to diagnose diabetes insipidus. Regarding the anterior pituitary insufficiency, both hypothyroidism and hypocortisolism can prove to be lethal, while growth hormone and gonadotrophic hormone deficiency can lead to stunting and sexual immaturity.
