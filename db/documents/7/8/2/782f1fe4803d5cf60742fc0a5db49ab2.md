The inferior alveolar nerve block provides temporary anesthesia to the following structures: the mandibular teeth in the ipsilateral quadrant, gingival tissue, and mucoperiosteum of the mandibular arch; it also blocks the sensory innervations of the lower lip. Many surgical procedures of the mandible can benefit from this block, such as tooth extraction, surgical reconstruction, root canal, periodontal treatment, and stabilization in traumatic and fracture cases.
