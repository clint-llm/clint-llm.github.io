CAD most commonly causes ischemic cardiomyopathy. Lack of adequate blood supply is not able to meet the myocardial metabolic demands that lead to cell death, fibrosis, left ventricular enlargement and dilation.

Risk factors for ischemic cardiomyopathy can be classified as modifiable and non-modifiable.

- Modifiable: Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco abuse, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle

- Non-modifiable: Age, gender, and family predisposition
