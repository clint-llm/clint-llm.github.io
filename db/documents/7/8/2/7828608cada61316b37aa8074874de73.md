Blood Supply:

The blood supply to the brain is primarily by the two internal carotid arteries (ICA) and two vertebral arteries which anastomose together to form the circle of Willis.

- Anterior cerebral arteries (ACA) which come off the ICA,

- Anterior communicating artery which connects the two ACA,

- Posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) which are terminal branches of the basilar artery,

- Posterior communicating artery which connects each of the PCA to the internal carotid (this sometimes connects to the middle cerebral artery instead) in the brain thus forming a loop between the two hemispheres of the brain.

The ICA and its branches of the ACA and middle cerebral artery (MCA) are part of the anterior circulation of the brain while the PCA is the posterior circulation. The areas where the posterior and anterior circulation anastomoses together (connections between MCA, PCA, and ACA) are termed watershed areas because they are at risk of hypo-perfusion during episodes of hypotension.

The PCA are terminal branches of the basilar artery which is formed by the joining of the two vertebral arteries. The vertebral arteries traverse the transverse foramen of C1 to C6 at which point they give off two branches which anastomose into the anterior spinal artery, and two other branches which become the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA).

Blood flow distribution:

Total cerebral blood flow measurement is the blood flow rate through the vertebral arteries and internal carotid arteries, and the average is found to be (717±123 mL/min).

The distribution of tCBF is approximately 72% in the anterior circulation (defined as flow through the two ICA) and 28% in the posterior circulation (defined as flow through the two vertebral arteries); this distribution was not affected by sex or age.

- MCA: 21%

- Distal MCA: 6%

- ACA: 12%

- Distal ACA: 4%

- PCA: 8%

- Basilar: 20%

The blood flow rate in PCA of females is higher than that of males, and healthy elderly have a lower blood flow rate than healthy younger patients.

The lymphatic system:

Recent evidence supports information that the lymphatic vessels are supported by both the vagal cholinergic (parasympathetic in this case) and sympathetic nervous system, capable of modulating the contraction (peristalsis, also aided by the breath and the pulsatility of the arterial vessels). There are vessels with contractile fibers (with an actin-like protein). Probably, the presence of both parasympathetic and sympathetic systems would function not only as a vessel voltage modulator but also as sensors of the contractile state of the vessel itself.

The dural system has a lymphatic system, called the glymphatic system. The liquor is drained not only by the known venous route but also through the lymphatic pathways. Lymphatic vessels only affect the dura mater, supporting the venous and arterial pathways of the brain; in particular, they come out of the skull following the inverse path of the pterygopalatine artery and a branch of the internal carotid, along with the venous pathways outside the skull and the cranial nerves that exit the skull.

The lymphatic system is subject to aging, losing its elasticity, and creating "aneurysms" over time, or decreasing the number of vessels.
