Infancy is a period of rapid growth second only to the fetal period, with a pressing need to optimize nutrition to ensure adequate growth and organ development. This article covers defining nutritional requirements in infancy, appropriate measurement of growth, and provides an overview of common nutrient categories. This activity describes the nutritional needs of preterm infants, as well as selected pathological conditions in infancy, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for such infants.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the caloric need for the term and preterm infants.
- Review micro and macronutrient requirements for the term and preterm infants.
- Describe the growth indicators in assessing growth or growth failure and the importance of breastfeeding and donor milk in the nutrition of newborns.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate nutrition is supplied to term and preterm infants.
