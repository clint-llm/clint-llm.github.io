**Sight-Threatening**

These have been reported in 1% to 3% of eyes.

**Non-Sight-Threatening**

Dry eyes can occur following radial keratotomy due to reduced tear production. This is caused by damage to the nervesÂ from the incisions, which will affect the lacrimal reflex and the tear production cycle. Visual aberrations such as halo, glare, or light-bursts around lights, haze, and decreased contrast sensitivity can occur after radial keratotomy. Higher-order aberrations and increased pupil size are associated with radial keratotomy.
