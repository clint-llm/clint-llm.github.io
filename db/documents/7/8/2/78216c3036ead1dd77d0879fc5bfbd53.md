Neurological recovery in ISCA depends on the rapidity of diagnosis, promptness of surgical intervention, and the institution of appropriate antibiotics.

Among 38 cases of pediatric IASC studied between 1875 and 2001:

- Complete neurologic recovery in 18%

- Mild neurologic impairment in 39%

- Severe neurologic impairment in 11%

- Death in 21% of the cohorts was observed

In the latest systematic review of 137 cases:

- Recovery of 20%

- Residual deficits 17.1%

- Persistent deficits 40%, and

- Death in 14.2% of the cohorts was observed

Children with ICSA secondary to infected dermoid cysts have a chance of neurological improvement of less than 20%. The presence of fever and limb weakness has been observed to have high odds of poor clinical results.

Due to the advancement of medicine in the areas of antibiotics, radiology, and surgery, the mortality rate for ISCA has gone from 90% between 1840 and 1944 to 4-8% between 1998 and 2007.
