Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is contraindicated if the patient has a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to nirmatrelvir or ritonavir, other drugs in the same class, or drug components.

Moreover, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is contraindicated with the concomitant use of medications that depend on CYP3A for clearance and whose elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and life-threatening adverse reactions which are due to the CYP3A-inhibiting effects of ritonavir, which can increase plasma concentrations of those medications to dangerous levels.

Below is a partial list of those contraindicated medications and their potential adverse effects according to the FDA prescriber fact sheet.

- Alpha-1-adrenoreceptor antagonists (alfuzosin): hypotension

- Analgesics (pethidine): respiratory depression, hematologic abnormalities

- Antianginals (ranolazine): serious and life-threatening reactions

- Antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine): cardiac arrhythmias

- Anticancer drugs (encorafenib, ivosidenib): QT interval prolongation

- Anti-gout drugs (colchicine): severe and life-threatening reactions in renal or hepatic impairment

- Antipsychotics (lurasidone, pimozide, clozapine): cardiac arrhythmias

- Benign prostatic hyperplasia agents (silodosin): postural hypotension

- Cardiovascular agents (eplerenone): hyperkalemia

- Cardiovascular agents (ivabradine): bradycardia, conduction disturbances

- Ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovine): acute ergot toxicity

- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin): myopathy (including rhabdomyolysis)

- Immunosuppressants (voclosporin): acute and chronic nephrotoxicity

- Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors (lomitapide): hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal adverse effects(Possible increase of AUC 27 fold)

- Migraine medications (eletriptan, ubrogepant): cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events

- Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (finerenone): hyperkalemia, hypotension, hyponatremia

- PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil): visual abnormalities, hypotension, priapism, syncope

- Opioid antagonists (naloxegol): opioid withdrawal symptoms

- Sedatives/hypnotics (triazolam, oral midazolam): respiratory depression, extreme sedation

- Serotonin receptor 1A agonists/2A antagonists (flibanserin): hypotension, syncope, CNS depression

- Vasopressin receptor antagonists (tolvaptan): dehydration, hypovolemia, hyperkalemia

Furthermore, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is contraindicated with the concomitant use of medications that are CYP3A inducers, which can decrease nirmatrelvir plasma concentrations to levels that result in loss of virologic response and development of antiviral resistance. This is due to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir being a CYP3A substrate whose plasma concentration is decreased by CYP3A inducers.

The following is a partial list of those contraindicated medications whose coadministration with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir can result in loss of virologic response and antiviral resistance. Below is a partial list of those contraindicated medications whose coadministration with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir can result in loss of virologic response and antiviral resistance.

- Anticancer drugs (apalutamide)

- Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin)

- Antimycobacterial (rifampin)

- Cystic fibrosis drugs (lumacaftor/ivacaftor)

- Herbal products (St. John's Wort)

**Management of Potential Drug-drug Interactions**

- Ritonavir decreases the conversion to clopidogrel's active metabolite, leading to inadequate inhibition of platelet aggregation. Thus, it is recommended to avoid nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients at very high risk of thrombosis (e.g., early period post coronary stenting) unless clopidogrel can be switched to the noninteracting drug.

- Ritonavir has been shown to increase rivaroxaban AUC significantly and can potentially increase the risk of bleeding; thus, concurrent administration with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not advised. The management of this drug interaction would require pausing rivaroxaban and switching to alternative agents for the anticoagulation (such as edoxaban or LMWH).

- In patients receiving a ritonavir-boosted regimen with a calcineurin inhibitor(tacrolimus/cyclosporine), a significant increase in tacrolimus and cyclosporine exposure has been observed, which can lead to significant toxicity. Based on the clinical data, holding tacrolimus for eight days (i.e., five days during nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment and three days post-treatment) is recommended.

- According to the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, coadministration of fentanyl with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may increase the exposure of fentanyl with the risk of severe respiratory depression.
