The mylohyoid nerve is a branch off of the inferior alveolar nerve. The inferior alveolar nerve branches from the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. Any compromise to the nerve proximal to the mylohyoid nerve will potentially result in denervation of the mylohyoid nerve. The compromise can be in the form of ischemia, compression, severing the nerve, neoplasm, or iatrogenic.
