Evidence for radiation therapy in these tumors is limited. Of the six patients reported by the Dabska et al. group, three received radiation therapy; of these, two received preoperative radiation while one received it after surgery.

Due to the rarity of these tumors, the benefit of radiation therapy in a randomized trial would be difficult to obtain. Hence it would be prudent to consider radiation in tumors showing features of a high risk of recurrences such as size > 5 cm, deep invasion, and positive margins based upon their behavior pattern similar to low-grade sarcomas.
