The optimum treatment of chronic venous disease requires an interprofessional healthcare team approach. This group must include a primary care physician, vascular and general surgery experts, wound care nurses, physical and occupational therapists, dieticians, a weight management team, bariatric surgery, and a pharmacist.

An early diagnosis, treatment plan, and referral to a specialist are crucial to effectively managing chronic venous disease. Primary care providers should conduct diagnostic testing to rule out other causes of lower limb edema and avoid prescribing medications, such as calcium channel blockers and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, that may exacerbate the illness. The pharmacist may be able to review the patient's drugs and aid in the development of an alternate treatment plan to prevent the condition from worsening. Wound care nurses and occupational therapists may aid in treating venous ulcers.

Chronic venous ulcers that do not heal or disease recurrence should demand referral to vascular and general surgery experts. To avoid disease progression and recurrence, patients should be closely followed. Patients who fail conservative or pharmacological approaches to losing weight should be referred to a bariatric surgeon, as losing weight/maintaining optimal weight is crucial in managing chronic venous disease.
