A hamartoma is a discrete lesion that resembles a neoplasm but often arises from an errant organ and contains atypical portions of tissue elements.

Hypothalamic hamartoma develops in the fifth to sixth week of gestation that appears in and/or around the hypothalamus arising from infundibular recess and mammillary bodies. There is a theory that a defect in the fetal development of the hypothalamus results in the development of the tumor. Pathologically hypothalamic hamartoma consists of mature neurons and glial cells with a range in size from 10 to 30 mm.

The cause of hypothalamic hamartoma remains unknown. Cases are usually sporadic with no identified family history, and the patient remains the only affected individual. classically presents with hypothalamic hamartoma and polydactyly.
