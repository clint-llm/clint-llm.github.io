The exact cause of Dressler syndrome is unknown, though it is thought to be immune-mediated. Antimyocardial antibodies have been shown to be elevated in the blood of patients with Dressler syndrome. Still, it is unclear whether these antibodies are the cause or occur as a result of the syndrome. These anti-myocardial antibodies are thought to target antigens that have become exposed through damage to the pericardium.

Viruses that have been associated with Dressler syndrome include:

- Coxsackie B

- Adenovirus

- Cytomegalovirus

These patients present with elevated levels of viral components.
