A certain degree of presbycusis is inevitable with aging. It is important to educate patients, caretakers, and colleagues about the high prevalence of age-related hearing impairment and its many consequences. Successful interventions do exist. Early identification and treatment may help to slow progression and improve the quality of life.

Because poor hearing is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, avoiding smoking, staying physically and cognitively active may help to delay the onset and slow the progression of hearing loss.

Maintaining clean ears by safely removing cerumen and avoiding loud noises without ear protection may help to prevent other causes of hearing loss that can worsen the symptoms of presbycusis.
