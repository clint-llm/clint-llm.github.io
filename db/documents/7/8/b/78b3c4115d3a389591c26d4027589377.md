Levothyroxine(T4) is a synthetic version of the bodyâ€™s natural thyroid hormone: thyroxine(T4). Normally, the hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone(TRH), which then stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone(TSH), which subsequently stimulates the thyroid to secrete 80% thyroxine (T4) and 20% L-triiodothyronine(T3). Fifty percent of thyroxine (T4) then gets converted to its active metabolite L-triiodothyronine (T3). The thyroid hormones then work by binding to thyroid receptor proteins contained within the cell nucleus.

Once inside the nucleus, thyroid hormones directly influence DNA transcription to increase body metabolism by increasing gluconeogenesis, protein synthesis, the mobilization of glycogen stores, and other functions.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Orally administered levothyroxine is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum (40% to 80%). The relative bioavailability of levothyroxine tablets, compared to an equal dose of oral levothyroxine solution, is approximately 93%. Levothyroxine absorption is increased by fasting and is decreased in the presence of food and malabsorption syndromes. Dietary fiber reduces the bioavailability of T4.

**Distribution: T**hyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA). T4 has a greater affinity for TBG and TBPA, leading to slower metabolic clearance and a longer half-life of T4 than T3. The free hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions alter the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins.

**Metabolism:**Thyroid hormones are primarily metabolized by sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of T3 derives from peripheral T4. The liver is the primary site of degradation for T4 and T3, with T4 deiodination also occurring at several additional sites, including the kidney. T4 is deiodinated to generate an equal quantity of T3 and reverse T3 (rT3). T3 and rT3 are then deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation and undergo enterohepatic recirculation.

**Excretion:**The kidneys primarily excrete thyroid hormones. Approximately 20% of T4 is excreted in the stool. Urinary excretion of T4 decreases with age.
