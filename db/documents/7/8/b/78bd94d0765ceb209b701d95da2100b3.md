Preparation involves discussing the anticipated results with the patient, including the expected change to the tension and vector of the scar and any distorted structures, as well as the addition of two more incision limbs. Careful attention to the geometry of the Z-plasty, particularly the length, orientation, and location of the oblique incision limbs, should be paid, and the flaps should be marked appropriately. As with many other comparatively minor surgeries, such as upper lid blepharoplasty and direct brow lifting, the preoperative decision-making and incision marking process require the most thought, while the procedure itself is comparatively straightforward.
