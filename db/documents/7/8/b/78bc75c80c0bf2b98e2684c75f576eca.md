About 10% of infants with neonatal brachial plexus palsy fail to gain functional recovery. Intervention for this group is needed and includes the resection of neuroma-in-continuity (NIC) and surgical nerve reconstruction to solve the problem. Formation of NIC inhibits functional recovery of neonatal brachial plexus palsy. A series of NIC tissue samples are obtained and analyzed using an array of immunohistochemical techniques. It is discovered that NIC contained multiple focal globular areas with markedly diminished myelination. This focal area, focal myelin deficits (FMDs), includes Schwann cells that wrap axons in normal configuration but do not form the myelin sheath. Axon segments in FMDs also had disturbed nodes of Ranvier. The axon in FMDs may be a pathobiological basis for explaining conduction blocks in neonatal brachial plexus, leading to functional recovery failure. Otherwise, this mechanism needs further studies.
