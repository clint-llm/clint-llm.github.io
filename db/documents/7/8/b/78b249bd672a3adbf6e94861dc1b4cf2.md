When evaluating any patient with an orbital mass, it is important to keep a broad differential diagnosis. A thorough history and clinical examÂ are paramount for determining risk factors for various disease processes and guiding the acuity of diagnostic workup and treatment. Inflammatory signs are not often seen with tumors and may indicate infectious or inflammatory dacryoadenitis. Pain or hypoesthesia is often an indicator of malignancy as most benign lesions are painless. Imaging is equally important in diagnosis and in the decision-making process for treatment; it can aid with surgical planning.
