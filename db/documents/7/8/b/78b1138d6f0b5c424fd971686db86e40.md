The genetic mutation results in a deficiency of the beta-globin chain. The excess unpaired alpha globin leads to hemolysis of Red blood cells in the bone marrow and extramedullary hematopoiesis, causing chronic anemia.

The constellation of symptoms, complications, and the degree of anemia may make the patient transfusion-dependent, which can have various complications. Beta thalassemia patients have high iron levels in their Red blood cell membrane due to denatured hemoglobin.

Ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic anemia, and hypoxia can cause increased GI absorption of iron.

Free iron species like the labile plasma iron and the labile iron pool in RBCs can contribute if transferrin saturation exceeds 70%. These free iron species eventually generate reactive oxygen species, which cause tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
