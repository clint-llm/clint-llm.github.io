Although Plummer-Vinson syndrome is a rare diagnosis, there should be high clinical suspicion in patients with iron-deficiency anemia, esophageal webs, and post-cricoid dysphagia. Hematological testing is done to ascertain the cause of iron deficiency and the severity of anemia. Complete blood count, peripheral smear, and iron studies (e.g., serum iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity [TIBC], transferrin saturation) should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia.

The esophageal web is investigated by radiographic tools such as barium swallow, which is generally available easily even in remote locations and is a diagnostic tool with the advantage of reproducible documentation. Videofluoroscopy is usually more reliable for the demonstration of esophageal webs.

Fiberoptic endoscopy is the safest and most reliable tool for GI tract examination. Esophagoscopy, an endoscopic examination of the esophagus, can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in the same setting. During esophagoscopy, esophageal webs appear as smooth, thin, gray lesions with normal-appearing mucosa and a central or lateral lumen and are most commonly located on the anterior wall of the esophagus.
