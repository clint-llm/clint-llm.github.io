The diagnosis and appropriate treatment of ulnar nerve entrapment require that all members of the healthcare team have a basic level of understanding of the pathology of the entrapment, as well as their role in the management of the patient's symptoms. Primary care physicians and mid-level practitioners are often the first steps in the diagnosis of ulnar nerve entrapment syndromes. A basic understanding of the anatomy of the upper extremity is paramount to provide initial counsel to patients with symptoms of nerve entrapment, as well as to direct them to the appropriate provider for further management. Occupational therapists can be utilized to counsel patients on appropriate positional or padding techniques to alleviate symptoms. Neurologists are employed to perform electromyography studies, and can also be invaluable in the diagnostic process of determining the location of nerve compression. If the patient is a surgical candidate, it is paramount that the surgeon has a clear understanding of the patient's anatomy, and that his or her surgical staff is informed and aware of the surgical plan.

A review of 50 published reports of more than 2000 patients by Dellon et al. reveals that nonoperative management yields excellent results for half of the patients with mild symptoms, and surgical management with decompression and transposition yields excellent results in almost 100% of cases.
