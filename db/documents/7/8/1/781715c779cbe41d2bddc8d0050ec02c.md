Epoetin alfa is available in single-dose, preservative-free, or multi-dose, preserved vials.

This medication can be administered via the intravenous or subcutaneous route. Subcutaneous is the preferred route for administration except in patients with end-stage kidney disease on maintenance hemodialysis. In dialysis patients and neonates, the IV route is recommended.

When injected intravenously, epoetin alfa clears from plasma with a half-life of 4 to 8 hours. However, the effect on bone marrow progenitors lasts much longer, and once-weekly dosing can be sufficient sometimes. Single vial dose is preservative-free, so, should be diluted in a syringe as a 1 to 1 dilution using normal saline in adults but do not dilute in neonates or infants.
