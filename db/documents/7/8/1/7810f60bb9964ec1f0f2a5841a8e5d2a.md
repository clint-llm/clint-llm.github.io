Abnormalities of the urinary collecting system and bladder are common, particularly in the pediatric population. Early diagnosis and treatment of common maladies such as vesicoureteral reflux are essential to preserving renal function. Radionuclide cystography is a commonly used method to evaluate for possible vesicoureteral reflux. This activity describes radionuclide cystography and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for radionuclide cystography.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to radionuclide cystography.
- Explain the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance of radionuclide cystography.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the performance of radionuclide cystography and improve outcomes.
