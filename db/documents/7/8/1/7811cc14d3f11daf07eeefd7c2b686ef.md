IOP measurements are of utmost importance in diagnosing, screening, and managing patients with glaucoma. Treatment with local drops, laser, and/or surgery to avoid the onset and worsening of glaucomatous optic neuropathy and visual field defect progression involves lowering IOP, which is the only risk factor that can be modified in glaucoma cases.

GAT is considered the gold standard in the routine clinical management of patients. Alternative methods of tonometry can be considered in select cases; however, routine clinical management to date remains IOP with GAT.
