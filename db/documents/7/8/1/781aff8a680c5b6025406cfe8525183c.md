Neural tube defects occur during the fourth week due to the failure of the anterior or posterior neuropores to fuse, causing a persistent connection between the amniotic cavity and the spinal canal. Failure of neural tube closure is affected by genetic mutation or if the pregnant mother suffers exposure to certain environmental factors such as intake of harmful chemicals, i.e., .valproic acid, maternal infection, irradiation, maternal diabetes, as well as low folic acid intake during pregnancy.

**Spina bifida occulta**: This condition is a failure of the caudal neuropore to close but does not herniate due to the dura being intact. It is usually seen at lower vertebral levels and is associated with a tuft of hair or dimpling of the skin at the level of the bony defect.

**Meningocele**: the meninges, but no neural tissue herniates through the bony defect.

**Meningomyelocele**: both the meninges and the neural tissue herniate through the bony defect.

**Myeloschisis**: exposure of unfused neural tissue without any skin covering it.

**Anencephaly**: This condition is a failure of the rostral neuropore to close, causing an open calvarium due to agenesis of the forebrain. Associated with polyhydramnios, which is the excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid.

During the fifth and sixth weeks, failure of the right and left hemispheres to separate may occur due to a mutation in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway resulting in holoprosencephaly. It is present in trisomy 13, Patau syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome. A moderate form of holoprosencephaly will result in cleft lip/palate, while a more severe form will result in cyclopia, which is characterized by the failure of the prosencephalon to divide the orbits into two eyes cavities properly.
