To enhance prostate cancer screening outcomes, an interprofessional team of specialty-trained nurses, general practitioners, advanced practice providers, urologists, and oncologists must coordinate to deal with various issues that continue to challenge them in dealing with uncertainties regarding prostate cancer screening outcomes. Some of these challenges include:

- Individualizing the evaluation of a single, elevated PSA level.

- Recognizing that a second, separate PSA test is required before confirming a diagnosis.

- Resolving the controversy regarding empiric antibiotic therapy.

- Using other tests to complement PSA in improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.

- Using prostatic MRIs and risk stratification bioassays.

- Implementing new prostate screening guidelines when available.

- Using the newly available genomic and bioassay tests at each stage of the evaluation.

- Negotiating conflicting recommendation guidelines.

Enhancing outcomes is achievable by being familiar with the new recommendations and information regarding screening for prostate cancer, as well as effective collaboration and communication amongst the interdisciplinary team members. The interprofessional team can individualize the appropriate evaluation of each patient through shared communication and care coordination. Specialty care nurses must work with the team to coordinate care and aid in educating patients. [Level 5]
