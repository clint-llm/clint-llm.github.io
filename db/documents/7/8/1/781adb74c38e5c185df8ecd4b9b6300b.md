Due to the non-invasive nature of hearing aids, their associated clinical complications are low. Hearing aids are often issued to patients with syndromic and anatomical features, which may cause higher complication rates in invasive interventions such as T-tube insertion and implantable devices like bone-anchored hearing aids.

Professionals are key in providing families with the appropriate pre-fitting counseling, device management skills, and post-fitting support to ensure that hearing aids are utilized optimally.
