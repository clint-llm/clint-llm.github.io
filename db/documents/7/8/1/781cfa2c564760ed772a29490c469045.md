Pathogenesis of trigger points is thought to be related toÂ abnormal motor end-plates within a muscle where the motor and nociceptive nerves co-exist, with a component of enhanced central sensitization in the spinal cord.

The most common muscle groups treated using trigger point injections include the masseter, levator scapulae, gluteus medius, quadratus lumborum, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and temporalis muscles.
