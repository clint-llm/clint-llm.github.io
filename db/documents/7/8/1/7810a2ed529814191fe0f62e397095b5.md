The femoral artery provides the main arterial supply to the lower extremity. A continuation of the external iliac artery, the common femoral artery enters the thigh, passing deep to the inguinal ligament. Once in the thigh, the femoral artery gives off several branches.

- Medial femoral circumflex artery

- Lateral femoral circumflex artery

- Femoral profunda (deep artery of the thigh) artery

- Medial and Lateral femoral circumflex branches

- The medial femoral circumflex artery is the predominant blood supply to the head (via the lateral epiphyseal artery)


- First, second, and third perforating branches 

- Supply the medial thigh muscles

- Superficial femoral artery
