The clinical presentation of VFS can vary, ranging from minor pruritus to occasionally life-threatening symptoms. Symptoms may occur as soon as four minutes after initiating the first dose until up to seven days after dose completion. Patients with infections treated with intravenous vancomycin are at risk of developing VFS. The signs and symptoms of VFS include:

- Erythematous rash on the face, neck, and upper torso

- Nausea, vomiting

- Pruritis

- Hypotension

- Fever, chills

- Weakness, dizziness

- Chest or back pain, trunk muscle spasms

- Angioedema

- Tachycardia

- Rash on the extremities may occur but is typically less severe than the rash on the face, neck, and upper torso
