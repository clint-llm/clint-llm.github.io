Fludrocortisone is used all around the world and prescribed by clinicians, including NDs, osteopathic clinicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. Since the drug can interact with many other medications and may cause serious adverse effects or toxicity, interprofessional healthcare team members must be aware of these consequences. All team members, whether involved in prescribing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring fludrocortisone, must be well educated about the pharmacology of this drug. A proper history and physical examination must be considered before initiating fludrocortisone. The patient must be educated about the adverse effects, potential toxicity, and appropriate dosing of this drug so they can use the medication properly. They can report to the clinician within a short timeframe if any adverse events occur or are beginning to manifest.

Interprofessional team discussion that includes all clinicians (including specialists such as endocrinologists), nursing staff, and pharmacists is crucial for every patient. The interprofessional team must monitor the patient at a regular interval and be ready for a prompt response if there are any signs or symptoms of adverse events. Besides the health team and patient, other family members should also be educated about proper dosing, adverse effects, and warning signs. This team approach will drive improved patient outcomes and mitigate potential adverse events. [Level 5]
