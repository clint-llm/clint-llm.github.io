There is limited knowledge of the overdosage of eptifibatide in literature.Â In preclinical studies, eptifibatide was not lethal to experimental animals in a dosage of two to five times the recommended MRHD(maximum daily human dose). However, symptoms of acute toxicity were evident such as loss of righting reflex, dyspnea, ptosis and decreased muscle tone in rabbits, and petechial hemorrhages in monkeys' femoral and abdominal areas. From in vitro studies, eptifibatide has limited protein binding; consequently, it may be removed from the plasma by dialysis( according to the manufacturer's labeling).

Bleeding at intravenous sites is the most common adverse effect. Simultaneous use of NSAIDs or other antiplatelet drugs and renal insufficiency would increase the risk of bleeding. There is no specific antidote for eptifibatide toxicity. Clinicians should discontinue eptifibatide when platelet counts are under 50000 cells/microliter. A platelet transfusion should be ordered when platelet counts are less than 20000 cells/microliter or significant bleeding.
