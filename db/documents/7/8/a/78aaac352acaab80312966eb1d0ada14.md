The majority of patients with an injury to the canaliculi are likely to make the first contact with healthcare through an emergency department or another acute care facility. The management of canalicular laceration does not stop in the emergency department. Early referral to, and discussion with, ophthalmology, plastic surgery, or maxillofacial surgery will produce the best long-term outcomes. Collaboration, shared decision making, and communication are key elements for a good outcome. Only by working as an interprofessional team can the morbidity of canalicular laceration be decreased. The earlier signs and symptoms of complications are identified, the better the prognosis and overall outcome. A holistic and integrated approach, with interprofessional collaboration, can help to achieve the best possible outcomes for these patients. [Level 3]
