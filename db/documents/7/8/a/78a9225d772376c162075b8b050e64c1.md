A thorough history and examination with vital sign measurements are sufficient to establish a diagnosis of high-altitude pulmonary edema. No specific laboratory or radiographic findings are required for diagnosis, though they can support and offer additional clinical indicators of disease process.

Radiologic findings on X-ray for HAPE include pulmonary infiltrates in an unequal, patchy distribution, unilateral or bilateral. The right middle lobe is most commonly affected. The degree of infiltrates correlates with severity.

Pulmonary ultrasound reveals comet tails or B-lines. The comet tail scoring system designed for use in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is also effective for altitude-related pulmonary edema. The sonographic artifact results from edema causing interference that reflects the ultrasound beam.

Echocardiographic findings in HAPE include increased pulmonary artery pressures and, in severe cases, right heart strain.

No laboratory testing will definitively diagnose HAPE. Arterial blood gas (ABG) usually shows hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis. A mild leukocytosis in HAPE patients is common but nonspecific. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing may reveal a mild to moderate elevation.
