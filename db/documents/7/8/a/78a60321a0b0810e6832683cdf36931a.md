The etiology of CCh has not been fully elucidated. Some studies have hypothesized that the condition may be secondary to the degradation of elastic fibers.

Furthermore, the cumulative mechanical insults likely induce an inflammatory response and secondary conjunctival and Tenon capsule breakdown. The formation of the LIPCOF decreases tear outflow, leading to the build-up of inflammatory molecules on the ocular surface and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
