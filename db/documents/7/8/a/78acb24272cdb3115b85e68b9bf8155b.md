For healthy, young, premenopausal women, one of the best ways to avoid acute pyelonephritis is to focus on the prevention of one of the more common predisposing causes, which is urinary tract infections. While many factors may lead to urinary tract infections, a simple way to help in prevention is to void before and immediately after intercourse, as well as wipe from front to back after urinating and defecating. This will help to stop the introduction of bacteria into the urethra and subsequent ascending structures. Aside from behavioral interventions, there have also been studies focusing on cranberry juice, probiotics, and low dose prophylactic antibiotics to prevent UTIs.
