The etiology ofÂ intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is poorly understood and is thought to be complicated and multifactorial. Genetic susceptibility, hormonal, and environmental factors have been proposed as possible mechanisms. There appears to be a relation between cholestatic properties of reproductive hormones in genetically susceptible women and ICP. The supportive evidence for the genetic susceptibility hypothesis lies in the fact that the disease has been observed more in familial clustering patterns, first-degree relatives, and a higher risk of disease recurrence with subsequent pregnancies.

The role of reproductive hormones in developing ICP has also appeared in multiple studies. Many studies showed an association of high levels of estrogen conditions such as multitone pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation effect, and late second-trimester presentation of ICP.

Environmental and seasonal factors have also correlated with ICP. ICP is noted to be more prevalent in women with a low level of selenium and vitamin D. It is also common in some countries in winters when selenium and vitamin D may be low.

Chronic underlying liver disease correlates with ICP; however, it is not yet clear whether chronic liver diseases contribute to developing ICP or are revealed by pregnancy.
