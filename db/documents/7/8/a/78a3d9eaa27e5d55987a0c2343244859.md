The eosinophilic granulomas are often multiple, with central necrosis surrounded by eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, epithelioid histiocytes, and/or giant cells. They are present predominantly around the blood vessels. Charcot-Leyden crystals are often present. Remnants of parasites might be present in some cases. Serologic test for Toxocara may be positive. Immunohistochemical staining using polyclonal antisera against Toxocara larvae demonstrates positivity in macrophages in sixty percent of cases.
