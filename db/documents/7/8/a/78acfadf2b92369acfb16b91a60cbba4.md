Semen analysis is a laboratory test that is performed to assess male fertility. Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 1 year of unprotected sexual intercourse. About 15% of all couples in reproductive-aged couples experience infertility. Infertility in a male is assessed by taking a detailed medical and sexual history, a complete physical examination, and semen analyses. The male factor significantly contributes to 30% of the infertility cases and is a contributing factor in about half.

Semen is released in boluses during ejaculation. It contains a mixture of spermatozoa that are produced in the testes, processed in the epididymides, and mixed with secretions from the male accessory sex organs, including the prostate, seminal vesicles, bulbourethral glands, and the epididymides.
