**Summary**

It is best to provide patients with reasonable expectations of ultimate success at the initial visit, as the general public often has a somewhat exaggerated view of the true capabilities of modern medicine in treating azoospermia and male infertility.

Two properly collected separate semen samples showing no sperm are required to establish the initial diagnosis of azoospermia. Even with azoospermia, most patients can be helped with sperm retrieval procedures and ICSI.

A detailed history and careful physical and initial hormonal screening (testosterone, FSH, LH, prolactin, and estradiol) are necessary to classify the type of azoospermia as obstructive vs. non-obstructive. Karyotype analysis and genetic testing for Y chromosome microdeletions should be offered to azoospermic men without an apparent cause of their disorder. Genetic testing is recommended before sperm retrieval procedures or testis biopsies. Only

Selective scrotal ultrasonography and transrectal ultrasound examinations may also be helpful in further diagnosing and classifying azoospermia.

Karyotype testing and genetic screening are recommended before sperm retrieval procedures to avoid unnecessary surgeries.

- A missing vas deferens or seminal vesicle suggests a cystic fibrosis gene mutationâ€”test for CFTR.

- Bilateral small, firm testes are suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome. Perform karyotype.

- Small or normal testicular size and elevated FSH levels suggest non-obstructive azoospermia from a primary testicular disorder of spermatogeneses such as maturational arrest, Sertoli cell-only syndrome, Y chromosome microdeletions, or similar. Consider genetic testing and testis biopsy.

- Normal testicular size with low or micro-TESE, TESA, or MESA is reasonable for ICSI in most cases of azoospermia EXCEPT for primary testicular failure due to Y chromosome microdeletions of the AZFa, AZFb, or AZFc subregions, in which case donor sperm or adoption should be considered.

- Maturational arrest and Sertoli cell-only syndrome will have substantially lower rates of successful sperm retrieval than most other causes of non-obstructive azoospermia.

- No elevation of FSH levels or degree of testicular atrophy is sufficient to guarantee that no sperm will be found on sperm retrieval.

- The role of FSH stimulation in increasing sperm numbers before a testis biopsy and sperm retrieval procedures is controversial and not currently recommended.

- Testosterone supplementation has no role in male infertility or azoospermia treatment.

- The overall success rate of sperm retrieval in non-obstructive azoospermia is about 50%.

- The overall successful pregnancy rate with ICSI is about 50%.

Obstructive azoospermia can be effectively treated with either surgical reconstruction or sperm retrieval and ICSI. In ideal situations, reconstruction is preferred, but sperm retrieval with ICSI is the better choice if secondary male infertility factors, concomitant female factors, or poor results are expected from the surgery for some other reason.

Most men with azoospermia will have the non-obstructive type, where sperm retrieval followed by ICSI is often their best option. Most of these men will still provide viable sperm for assisted reproduction, with only a few exceptions.
