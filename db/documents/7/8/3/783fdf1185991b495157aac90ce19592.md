Although most patients will maintain good vision and the disease is slowly progressive, there still needs to be follow-up and a full workup to ensure there is no concurrent AMD. Some may experience a more rapid course of vision loss, requiring low vision therapy. Rarely can patients experience complications such as choroidal neovascularization or macular holes, making it critically important to seek medical care if experiencing vision loss.
