In simple pelvic kidneys without complications, no intervention is required. However, if there are complications such as renal calculi, the distorted anatomy may make the condition more difficult to manage, and it is, therefore, important to understand the anatomy and vasculature of pelvic kidneys.

In the event a patient develops renal calculi in the ectopic, pelvic kidney, operative intervention is much more complicated than in an anatomically normal renal unit due to the different location of the ureters.

Specific problems with ectopic kidneys can be dealt with individually, if necessary. Separating a fused renal mass is not recommended due to the potential for vascular injury, renal infarction, tissue necrosis, and decreased renal function.

In general, significant surgery is discouraged in ectopic kidneys except for specific problems, and most cases can be managed conservatively. Percutaneous access to relieve an obstruction or for percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be more complicated or even impossible in some cases depending on the individual anatomy, and this needs to be taken into consideration. 24-hour urine testing for nephrolithiasis prophylaxis is recommended in patients that have had nephrolithiasis with ectopic kidneys due to the increased complexity of kidney stone surgery in these individuals and the risk of loss of renal function.
