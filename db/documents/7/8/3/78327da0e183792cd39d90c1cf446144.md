Dopamine agonists are used in patients with Parkinson disease. Dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, are the first-line treatment for restless legs syndrome, while bromocriptine is given for neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Dopamine agonists are also prescribed to counteract dopamine antagonist-induced hyperprolactinemia.
