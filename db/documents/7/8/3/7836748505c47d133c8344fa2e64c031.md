When a prescriber provides a written request for special packaging, the pharmacist's role is not only to fulfill the request but also to act as a knowledgeable resource for the patient. It is advisable for the dispensing pharmacist to periodically verify with all patients who have blanket waiver requests for non-special packaging to ensure that noncomplying packaging is the preferred packaging choice for the patients' prescription drugs. In case of suspected poisoning or childhood ingestion emergency, if a health care provider cannot provide the necessary emergency information for the caller or advise on the proper course of action, refer the caller to the Poison Control Center or nearest hospital emergency room. The National Poison Control Center phone number is 1-800-222-1222.

While one of the largest responsibilities of the Poison Prevention Act remains is those who manufacture and package the pharmaceutical and household products that are deemed poisonous to children, physicians and pharmacists hold an equally critical role. Whether through providing feedback to pharmaceutical companies, modifying the packaging of specific pharmaceuticals, or even altering a therapeutic regimen, the final assessment remains at the discretion of the clinician and pharmacist. Both parties as a team must keep the patient's best interests at the forefront of this decision.
