There are no absolute contraindications to exchanging a tracheostomy tube in the emergency department as long as the stomal tract has matured. Before undertaking the exchange, consider whether further tissue trauma or hemorrhage might occur as a result of it.

On the other hand, tracheostomy tube change may not be suitable if the patient is in an unstable condition, requires high levels of ventilatory support with oxygen, or at high risk of losing the airway, such as when the tract is not yet mature.
