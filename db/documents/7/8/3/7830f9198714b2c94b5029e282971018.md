A strong index of clinical suspicion is needed to rule out ACS and AECS; it is particularly crucial given the latter condition occurs in the absence of a traumatic injury or fracture. AECS is essentially a hybrid of ACS and CECS and is often overlooked or diagnosed in a delayed fashion. AECS patients often present following sport-related activity or exertion with nonspecific leg pain and persist after strenuous or repetitive activity. CECS clinically differentiates in that symptoms will predictably abate following activity cessation. While CECS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, AECS should be ruled out first before considering other diagnoses, which one accomplishes by measuring the patient's compartments in question.

The diagnosis of CECS has its basis in a thorough clinical history, paying particular attention to a patient's characterization of pain during strenuous activity, well-localized to a specific compartment, and the pain/symptoms disappear quickly after the cessation of activity.

In 70 to 95% of cases, the pain is bilateral.

Formal CECS testingÂ following stress-testing gets confirmed by compartment pressure measurements before and after exercise utilizing the Stryker pressure monitoring system as described previously.
