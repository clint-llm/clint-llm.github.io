There are a variety of causes of glottic insufficiency; among the most common are vocal fold paralysis (complete immobility of the vocal fold) or vocal fold paresis (weakness or partial immobility of the vocal fold). Vocal fold immobility is a physical finding rather than a diagnosis. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the underlying cause to determine an underlying diagnosis. The largest case series to date cites the most common cause of unilateral vocal cord paralysis as surgical injury.

Other causes of glottic insufficiency are presbylaryngis, sulcus vocalis, vocal fold nodules or neoplasm, central neurologic injury, peripheral neurologic injury, intubation-related injury, arytenoid trauma, infection, scarring or deformation of the vocal fold, and many others. The latter may be congenital, idiopathic, or secondary to iatrogenic causes such as glottic tumor excision.
