Before the CEAP classification, the diagnosis of chronic venous disorder lacked precision in diagnosis. This problem had led to reporting errors in studies of the management of venous problems. CEAP classification was then adopted worldwide, providing a universally understandable description, and it became an instrument to standardize the diagnosis and allow better communication of chronic venous disorder diagnosis between healthcare professionals. Accurate classification and proper diagnosis of the disease will help to create a base for better management for this condition.

Example of the CEAP classification application:

A patient comes in with swelling and tightness of the leg. On physical examination, the examiner observes varicose veins, lipodermatosclerosis, and healed ulceration. The duplex scanning report shows great saphenous vein reflux and popliteal and anterior tibial reflux. Signs of postthrombotic obstruction are negative.
