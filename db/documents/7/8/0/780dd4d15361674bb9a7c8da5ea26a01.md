Presentations of chlamydial pneumonia can be nonspecific. A high degree of clinical suspicion is important to diagnose the condition and treat it promptly. Empirical treatment with appropriate antibiotics usually treats the illness sometimes even before the lab reports are available.

Vulnerable groups of the population, including older adults, immunocompromised, and those with chronic health conditions should be given special attention as they are at high risk of having complications.

Possibility of co-infections with other pathogens such as Pneumococcus, Mycoplasma, and Legionella should always be considered when treating C. pneumoniae.

All women younger than 25 years and those at increased risk of infection should be screened for chlamydial infection.
