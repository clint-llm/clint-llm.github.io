Case studies have reported anatomical variations of the semitendinosus muscle. One such case was during an anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery where during graft harvesting, the semitendinosus muscle had given off an additional tendinous attachment. Along with the original insertion of the semitendinosus muscle, the muscle gave off an extra tendinous slip that was attached to the gracilis tendon at its insertion point.
