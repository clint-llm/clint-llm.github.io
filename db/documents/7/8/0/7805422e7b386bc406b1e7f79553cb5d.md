Pancreatic fistula is an abnormal connection between the pancreatic ductal epithelium and another epithelium surface. This is due to a disruption of the pancreatic duct leading to the pancreatic fluid to leak, producing erosion, and forming different pathways resulting in internal and external pancreatic fistulas. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pancreatic fistulas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of pancreatic fistulas.
- Describe the pathophysiology of pancreatic fistulas.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with pancreatic fistulas.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic fistulas.
