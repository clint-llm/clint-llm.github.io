The blood-ocular barrier comprises two systems: the blood-aqueous and the blood-retinal. The blood-retinal barrier is further divided into inner and outer barriers. The inner blood-retinal barrier comprises tight junctions between the retinal endothelial cells, and the outer blood-retinal barrier is the retinal pigment epithelium.

These barriers significantly restrict the extent of drugs reaching the posterior segment of the eye. Direct intravitreal injections into the vitreous help to achieve greater drug concentrations in the retina and vitreous with limited systemic side effects. However, they must be repeated frequently to maintain an effective therapeutic level of the drug since they have a short half-life. The solution to this problem is met by intravitreal implants, which help with sustained drug delivery to the posterior segment for a longer duration.
