Managing bleeding complications of enoxaparin is challenging. It requires collaboration between interprofessional health care team members such as clinicians (MD, DO, NP, PA), specialists, nurses, laboratory technicians, and pharmacists. The management of bleeding should not be delayed, and intervention should ensue as soon as possible. A blood bank should be contacted for the potential need for an urgent transfusion. As discussed above, protamine sulfate is the drug of choice in this situation. A conservative approach is necessary for the consideration of acute bleeding. Anticoagulation should be stopped with the reversal of anticoagulation. Fluid resuscitation is also essential if the patient is hemodynamically unstable.

The nurse should explain the procedure to the patient if the clinician prescribes enoxaparin for home administration. The pharmacist should consult with the prescriber regarding dosing; this should be with the initial prescription of enoxaparin and protamine in the event of reversal. The patient should receive education to report to the emergency department if any signs or symptoms of bleeding occur. Interprofessional collaboration is vital to improving patient outcomes related to enoxaparin therapy. All team members must maintain open communication with the rest of the care team and keep accurate records regarding enoxaparin therapy. The study reported a significant decrease in venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with an interprofessional team of hospitalists, intensivists, vascular, trauma, orthopedic surgeons, nurses, an inpatient pharmacy director, and a clinical pharmacist.
