Prolong use of Sodium polystyrene sulfonate can be attributed to several toxicities, including hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, sodium load, and colonic necrosis. Toxicity may occur to a greater extent with the concomitant administration of aluminum hydroxide, which may cause intestinal obstruction. Hypokalemia associated with SPS use may also increase the adverse effects of digitalis.
