Neurogenic shock is a devastating consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI). It manifests as hypotension, bradyarrhythmia, and temperature dysregulation due to peripheral vasodilatation following an injury to the spinal cord. This occurs due to the sudden loss of sympathetic tone, with preserved parasympathetic function, leading to autonomic instability. Neurogenic shock is mostly associated with cervical and high thoracic spine injury. Neurogenic shock should be differentiated from hypovolemic shock; the latter is often associated with tachycardia.

Neurogenic shock is not to be confused with a spinal shock which is the flaccidity of muscles and loss of reflexes seen following spinal cord injury.

Early identification and aggressive management are vital in neurogenic shock to prevent secondary spinal injury. This chapter is a concise overview to further aid the care for those patients who develop neurogenic shock.
