Oral hemangiomas affect up to 6.4% of infants, with limited data available to estimate prevalence in older age groups. These tumors are more common on the ventral surface of the tongue, as opposed to oral vascular malformations, which are more prevalent on the lips. OHs have a 3:1 female-to-male predominance and are more common in Whites. Infants who are premature, twins or triplets, have low birth weight (less than 1 kilogram), or who are born to older mothers are more likely to develop OHs.
