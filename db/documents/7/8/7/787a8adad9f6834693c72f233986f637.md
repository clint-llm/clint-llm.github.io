**Anchor Anatomy**

Variability in the anatomy of the biceps anchor and tendinous origin translates to varying levels of strain on the superior labrum.

- Posterior, complete – 22%

- Posterior, dominant – 33%

- Equal (anterior and posterior) – 37%

- Anterior, complete – 8%

- Posterior, complete – 28%

- Posterior, dominant – 56%

- Equal (anterior and posterior) – 16%

- Anterior, complete – 0%

The latter study is the contemporary consensus agreement regarding the LHBT attachment patterns.

**Sublabral Variations**

Another potential nidus predisposing certain patients to SLAP tears is the presence of a sublabral recess (or sublabral sulcus). The recess/sulcus can be present during fetal development as early as 22 weeks of pregnancy, persisting throughout childhood and into adulthood.

In contrast, a sublabral hole or sublabral foramen is typically located at the 12 to 2 o’clock position.

Finally, the Buford complex is a congenitally absent anterosuperior labrum plus a thickened cord-like middle glenohumeral ligament.
