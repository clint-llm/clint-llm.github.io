Nevus anemicus is attributed to the increased sensitivity of cutaneous blood vessels to catecholamines such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). This hypersensitivity results in permanent vasoconstriction leading to hypopigmentation. Nevus anemicus has also been described as a "pharmacologic nevus" due to this catecholamine sensitivity. It has been speculated that nevus anemicus is a mosaic disorder resulting from post-zygotic mutations. Interestingly, nevus anemicus has been reported to be resistant to dermatophyte infections such as Trichophyton rubrum, which was postulated to be due to the reduced blood flow and lower temperature of the lesional skin. Nevus anemicus may also be spared during generalized contact dermatitis. This phenomenon may be explained by the lack of expression of endothelial E-selectin and epidermal intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and HLA-DR within nevus anemicus skin, which interferes with the recruitment of circulating T lymphocytes that cause contact dermatitis.
