DGS results from microdeletion of 22q11.2, which encodes over 90 genes. Patients with DGS display a broad array of phenotypes, and the most common findings include cardiac anomalies, hypocalcemia, and hypoplastic thymus.

On a genetic basis, TBX1 has correlations with the most prominent phenotypes characteristic of DGS. Failure in embryologic development of the pharyngeal pouches, which is driven by TBX1, leads to absence or hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands. Mouse and zebrafish TBX1 knockout models have been studied to understand the embryologic basis of this disease. In mice, for instance, the absence of TBX1 causes severe pharyngeal, cardiac, thymic, and parathyroid defects as well as a behavioral disturbance.

A 22q11.2 knockout mouse model has also been studied, with findings pertinent for molecular and behavioral changes seen in Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.
