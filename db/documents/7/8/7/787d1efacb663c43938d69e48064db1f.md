Orf virus is a double-stranded DNA virus. As a poxvirus, Orfviridae shares the family’s rare trait for promiscuous mammalian cell entry. They do not require a specific receptor; instead, they utilize ambiguous and commonplace components such as glycosaminoglycans for attachment and fusion into the host cell. Thus, abrasions and breaks on human skin aid in giving access to the basal keratocyte layer with an increased likelihood of infection.

After successful entry, Orfviridae starts pumping out a medley of virulence factors – all with the aim of immunomodulation. Anti-inflammatory proteins, orf “viral” Interleukins, apoptosis inhibitor, and interferon resistance, are all made before any phase of viral replication.

The replication and extranuclear synthesis of the orf virus utilizes a double envelope structure that is unique to Poxviridae. A single extracellular virus is composed of many, individually infectious virions. This feature of Orfviridae and Poxviridae, in general, makes them particularly resilient and even capable of spread via fomites.
