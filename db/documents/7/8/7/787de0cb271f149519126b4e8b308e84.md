All patients showing an acute, allergic-like reaction to contrast should immediately have contrast administration stopped if possible, and receive hydration as well as antihistamine treatment. Although the literature review demonstrates an absence of specific medication regimens, treatment for allergic-like reactions to contrast agents is typically comprised of intravenous fluids, diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, or adrenaline in severe anaphylactoid presentations. Prophylactic medication regimens including prednisone, methylprednisone, hydrocortisone, and diphenhydramine have also been used in patients with allergic risk factors. A systematic review found a small reduction in respiratory symptoms and hemodynamic compromise with pretreatment with an estimated number needed to treat (NNT) of 100 to 150.

The treatment of patients with CIN is even less defined. Administration of acetylcysteine, fenoldopam, and hydration with normal intravenous saline or sodium bicarbonate have all been used in clinical trials as methods to prevent the development of CIN with statistically insignificant effects. Management of CIN is typically supportive, with intravenous hydration and close observation of serum creatinine serving as the cornerstones of treatment.
