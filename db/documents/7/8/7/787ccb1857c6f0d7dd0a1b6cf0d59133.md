Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease and requires effective coordination between an ophthalmologist, pulmonologist, infectious disease specialist, dermatologist, rheumatologist, radiologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and pharmacist. At each visit, an ophthalmic assistant should measure intraocular pressure in addition to vision, as both the disease and its treatment, i.e., steroids, can lead to raised intraocular pressure. The pharmacist plays a vital role in monitoring compliance to treatment and educating patients about the side effects of various drugs used in the treatment. Clinical overlap between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis is not uncommon, and an infectious disease specialist should be consulted in such cases. Nursing staff plays an important role in ensuring compliance with therapy. An optimal interprofessional collaboration can ensure the best outcomes in patients with ocular sarcoidosis.
