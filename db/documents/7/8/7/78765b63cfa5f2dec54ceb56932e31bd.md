Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a common condition for which clinical diagnosis is typically unreliable due to the infrequency of the classic findings of edema, warmth, erythema, pain, and tenderness, which are only present in 23 to 50 percent of patients. Failure to identify and treat deep venous thrombosis can lead to devastating results, including pulmonary embolism, superior vena cava syndrome, and associated complications up to and including death. However, empiric treatment with anticoagulation also comes with high-risk. Venogram remains the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. However, ultrasound is the most accurate non-invasive test to diagnose deep venous thrombosis. This activity reviews the ultrasonographic evaluation of deep venous thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain why it is important to diagnose a deep venous thrombosis.
- Review the clinically significant differences between an upper extremity deep venous thrombosis and a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
- Outline the methods for using an ultrasound examination to identify an upper extremity deep venous thrombosis versus a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
- Summarize the clinical impact that point of care ultrasonography can have on patient care and how the interprofessional team can evaluate and treat patients with deep venous thrombosis and improve outcomes.
