The main complication associated with endoscopic vein harvesting is wound infection. However, the rate of infection is minimal in comparison to the conventional technique. Hematoma, dehiscence, and infection are often managed conservatively, but additional surgery may be necessary for definitive correction.

Saphenous nerve injury during the procedure leads to postoperative pain and altered sensation along the medial aspect of the lower limb. Parasthesias and hyperalgesia can occur at the skin above the harvest site, which is typically temporary. After open and even endoscopic saphenous dissection, it is not uncommon for patients to report having more pain from their leg than from their sternum in the early postoperative period. The proceduralist needs to be aware to avoid damage to the adjacent saphenous nerve by mechanical force or the diathermy heat, particularly in the lower part of the leg where the nerve is close to the great saphenous vein.

Endoscopic vein harvesting insufflates carbon dioxide to facilitate vein exposure. Pneumoperitoneum, subcutaneous extravasation, and air embolism can occur as a result. Treatment typically involves stopping insufflation and supporting hemodynamic status until the carbon dioxide is absorbed.
