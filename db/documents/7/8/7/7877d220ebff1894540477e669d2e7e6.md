Sheehan syndrome which is also called post-partum pituitary necrosis refers to the necrosis of cells of the anterior pituitary gland following significant post-partum bleeding, hypovolemia, and shock. Advances in obstetrical care in developed countries have reduced the incidence of this condition. However, it is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in less developed countries. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Sheehan syndrome and discusses the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Sheehan syndrome conditions.
- Discuss the typical history and physical findings expected in Sheehan syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for Sheehan syndrome.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to identify Sheehan syndrome and improve outcomes.
