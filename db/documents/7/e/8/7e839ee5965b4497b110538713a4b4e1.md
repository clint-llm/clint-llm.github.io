Numerous photometric, fluorometric, and coupled-enzyme methods have been developed for the assay of CK activity, using either the forward (Cr --> CRP) or the reverse (Cr <-- CRP) reaction.

The techniques most commonly used for the analysis of CK isoenzyme are electrophoresis and various immunological methods.

Immunochemical methods apply to the direct measurement of CK-MB. In the immunoinhibition technique, an anti-CK-M subunit antiserum is used to inhibit both M subunits of CK-MM and the single M subunit of CK-MB, thus allowing the determination of the enzyme activity of the B subunit of CK-MB, the B subunits of CK-BB, and macro-CKs. To determine CK-MB, this technique assumes the absence of CK-BB (and of the other sources of interference such as macro-CKs) from the tested serum.

In contrast with immunoinhibition, which measures the CK-MB isoenzyme by determination of its catalytic activity, mass immunoassays measure CK-MB protein concentrations.
