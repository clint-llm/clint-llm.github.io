Heroin, also known as diacetylmorphine, is derived from the opium poppy plant. Professionals initially touted morphine as a substitute with less misuse potential. Heroin currently has no FDA-approved indications for use. Heroin is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, with no approved medical use in the United States. Though people in other countries use heroin, in the United States, it has no recognized therapeutic role in managing opioid use disorder. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, significant adverse effects, and toxicity of heroin and increases practitioners' knowledge regarding how to approach this substance should they encounter patients who use it in their practice.
