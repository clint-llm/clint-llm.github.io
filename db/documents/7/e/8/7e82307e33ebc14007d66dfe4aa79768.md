Since morbidity and mortality associated with fungal endocarditis is high, early diagnosis is needed for appropriate antimicrobial therapy and consideration for surgery. The diagnosis of fungal endocarditis is difficult due to the poor yield from blood cultures, which areÂ positive in less than 50% of the time.

The processing of blood cultures can be tedious and time-consuming. Quicker non-culture tests have been developed for the diagnosis of fungemia. Mannan antigen is a cell wall constituent of Candida spp. For candidemia, mannan antigen and antibody have a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 86%, respectively.

The histopathological examination is prudent in culture-negative cases and often helps to determine the diagnosis from the examination of the explanted valve, peripheral emboli, or systemic ulcers.

Echocardiography is an important tool in diagnostic evaluation. Characteristically, the lesions are large, left-sided (bilateral lesions are common in immunocompromised patients), and occasionally non-valvular. Echocardiography can also detect abscesses of the valve ring. Trans-esophageal echocardiography is more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of endocarditis than transthoracic echocardiography.

Blood work may reveal elevated WBC, ESR, and CRP. Thrombocytopenia is commonly seen in neonates.
