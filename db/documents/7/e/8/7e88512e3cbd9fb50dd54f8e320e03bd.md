PVB can help perfuse obstructed limbs. However, peripheral vascular disease is a progressive disorder with no cure. Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists, operating as an interprofessional healthcare team should educate patients on preventing PVD. This means discontinuing smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, controlling diabetes, lowering cholesterol, and remaining physically active. These lifestyle changes have more durable benefits than most bypass procedures.

PVB is not a benign procedure and is associated with serious complications, including death.
