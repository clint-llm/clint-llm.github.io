Follicular adenomas are a common benign neoplasm encountered in clinical practice. They usually present as a solitary thyroid nodule, but other presentations can occur in varied patients. It needs to be distinguished from follicular carcinoma, which is malignant and has a poor prognosis if undiagnosed. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of follicular adenomas, identifies features that distinguish it from its malignant counterpart, and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of follicular adenomas.
- Outline the typical clinical presentation of a follicular adenoma.
- Review special clinical features of follicular neoplasms and management considerations for patients with the same.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team dealing with follicular neoplasms especially when it comes to differentiating between a benign or malignant follicular neoplasm to improve patient outcomes with the right line of management.
