As individuals live longer, there is an increased burden of age-associated eye disease on society. This includes glaucoma, where many countries have a shortage of specialists, necessitating innovative methods to meet the needs of patients. This includes refined referral pathways, virtual clinics, artificial intelligence, community-based clinics, and training of allied health professionals in delivering patient care independently or as part of a consultant-led team.

Glaucoma is a chronic condition, and utilizing the communication skills of nursing and allied health staff in educating and training patients can improve patient understanding and treatment concordance. For those with glaucoma-related vision loss, low vision clinics can maximize remaining vision and help patients adapt to their disability. Local and national societies can provide patients with peer support, as well as opportunities for collaboration between healthcare providers and patient groups. Health professionals should be advocates for their patients to enable access to the treatments and services needed in their area.
