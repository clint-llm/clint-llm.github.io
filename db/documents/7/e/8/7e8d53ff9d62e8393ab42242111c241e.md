Malignant hyperthermia is a life-threatening clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism involving the skeletal muscle. It is triggered in susceptible individuals primarily by inhalational anesthetic agents and the muscle relaxant succinylcholine, although other drugs have also been considered potential triggers. It is not an allergy but an inherited disorder.Â A typical presentation involves tachycardia, dysrhythmias, rigidity, rapidly increasing temperature, hyperkalemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and multi-organ failure.
