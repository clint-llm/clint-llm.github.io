Supraglottic obstruction is a medical or surgical emergency. It can result in increased work of breathing and respiratory distress and can progress to fatal cardiopulmonary arrest. Prompt correction of the causative factor can relieve obstruction and lead to improvement of the respiratory and cardiac status as well as the mental status of the patient. This activity reviews the causes, presentation, and diagnosis of supraglottic obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**

- Review the presentation of a patient with supraglottic obstruction.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for supraglottic obstruction.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of supraglottic obstruction and improve outcomes.
