Laboratory tests: The initial evaluation aims to rule out hypothyroidism by measuring serum TSH levels and pregnancy in women. Serum levels of LH, along with FSH and prolactin (PRL), are measured. Pituitary tumors that extend superior to pituitary stalk and suprasellar tumors impair dopamine delivery to the pituitary stalk. They prevent dopamine inhibition of prolactin secretion from lactotrophs and cause hyperprolactinemia.

MRI of the head can help to study structural abnormalities in the hypothalamus and pituitary, especially pituitary adenomas.
