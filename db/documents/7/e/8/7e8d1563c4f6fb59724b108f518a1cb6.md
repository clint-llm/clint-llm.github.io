Even though no clear guidelines exist regarding the structure of the team itself, several key members are essential to developing a successful pulmonary rehabilitation program. The team usually includesÂ providers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, respiratory therapists, exercise physiologists, nurses, psychologists, behavior specialists, nutritionists, and social workers. This allows for a multi-modal approach.

The provider in charge serves as the medical director, who is responsible for the intake assessment, development of the plan along with the team, and monitoring of the progress and necessary adjustments to the treatment protocol. The psycho-social morbidity associated with progressive advanced lung disease needs to be understood when making treatment plans. A decrease in anxiety, depression, and improvement in cognition has been demonstrated with comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation.
