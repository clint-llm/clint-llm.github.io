Patient education is essential for the successful management of pulmonary hypertension. Treatment with the appropriate medications and patient understanding of the importance of adherence to the regimen provides the greatest likelihood for the best clinical outcome. Healthcare providers should work with patients to help them manage their expectations for treatment outcomes. Â Some patients will still experience significant exercise intolerance and may ultimately require pulmonary transplantation.

Patients afflicted with high altitude pulmonary hypertension should understand that pulmonary artery pressures can improve with a return to lower altitudes. If the disease's progression and severity are understood, urging the patient to return to lower altitudes can significantly improve the prognosis and quality of life.
