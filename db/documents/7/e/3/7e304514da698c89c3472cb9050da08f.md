Most coalitions are not symptomatic. The typical symptomatic presentation is of an adolescent with repeated ankle sprains and pain. Pain onset is either insidious or sudden when associated with an ankle sprain. The pain is usually aggravated by running, jumping, or prolonged standing and typically relieved by rest. Pain can be localized distal to medial malleolus at the site of the coalition, ankle joint, talonavicular joint, sinus tarsi, medially under the head of the plantarflexed talus and laterally over the peroneal tendons.

On inspection, the hindfoot is in valgus, forefoot abduction, varying degrees of medial longitudinal arch flattening. The arch does not reform on tiptoeing or on Jack's test. The patient is unable to stand on the lateral aspect of the foot. The subtalar movement becomes reducedÂ (fibrous)or completely absent (osseous). The gastrosoleus complex is tight, and lack of subtalar movement leads to peroneal spasm on forced inversion. There is a double medial malleolus sign: prominence palpated inferior to the medial malleolus, which represents the enlarged medial facet.
