A patient undergoing carotid endarterectomyÂ should be on antiplatelet therapy (unless contraindicated) prior to surgery. For this procedure, general anesthesia or local anesthesia may be used. For local anesthesia, the patient can be awake but sedated. They will feel numbness only at the site of the surgery. The patient should be draped and sterilized at the neck including the jaw and earlobe.
