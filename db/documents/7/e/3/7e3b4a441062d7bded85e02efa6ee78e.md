Most generalized seizures terminate in less than five minutes, and a seizure of longer duration or serial seizures without regaining full consciousness in between defines status epilepticus. Whether status epilepticus is from provoked causes or unprovoked causes, initial treatment isÂ similar.

A benzodiazepine such as diazepam, midazolam, or lorazepam is accepted as first-line medications. Underdosing is common when compared to guideline recommendations. Side effects are primarily respiratory depression and primarily related to the rate of administration. However, underdosing benzodiazepines may contribute to reduced efficacy, potentially resulting in prolongation of status epilepticus.

Outcomes following generalized convulsive status epilepticus depend on any underlying cause of the seizures and the duration of the status epilepticus.

For patients with seizures who require endotracheal intubation for airway management, neuromuscular blockade with paralysis will obscure signs of seizures. Stat EEG, if available, is recommended. If in doubt, medication administration with the presumption that seizures are continuing seems prudent in the short term.
