Each patient must be seen as a unique person. Many diagnoses and conditions can impact the care of patients during the last stages of life. Documentation should aim to be complete, clear, and factual regarding the patient’s circumstances and the impact their diagnoses have on their prognosis. There should be a frequent re-evaluation of the patient’s status as appropriate for continued hospice care through the lens of physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs. CMS requests coding of all current diagnoses in the documentation. Therefore, diagnoses made in the past that have no bearing on the patient’s current status or ongoing prognosis (history codes) should be removed per coding guidelines. Hospice claims can support up to twenty-five diagnoses, and if there are some diagnoses without designated codes or for whatever reason cannot be placed in the diagnoses section, those conditions can receive coverage in the narrative part of the plan of care in the documentation. Overall the process of enrolling patients into hospice and determining hospice-appropriate diagnoses requires critical thinking by the physician, with maintaining a current list of conditions and removing inappropriate history codes when applicable.

For reference, below is an abridged version of the currently outlined assessment criteria for the progression of diseases and non-disease baseline guidelines as obtained from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services:

**Part 1: Decline in a patient's clinical status guidelines**

A. Progression of disease via worsening status, symptoms, signs, laboratory results:

**Clinical Status**

- Refractory or recurring infections

- Progressive inanition is documented by several measures such as 10% body weight loss, decreased albumin, and dysphagia leading to aspiration, among others.

**Symptoms**

- Include a number of symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, persisting cough, fatigue, decreased cognition, diarrhea, and progressive pain

**Signs**

- Include a number of clinical signs, including hypotension, edema, ascites, progressive weakness, new altered mental status, among others

**Laboratory Results**

- Include a number of laboratory findings, including worsening pCO2/pO2/SaO2 values, worsening liver function tests, worsening tumor markers, and volatile sodium and potassium, among others

B. Progressive disease leading to worsened Karnofsky Performance Status or Palliative Performance Score.

C. Worsened functional assessment staging of diagnosed dementia.

D. Requiring assistance with additional ADLs

E. Worsening refractory stage 3 to stage 4 pressure ulcers despite wound care

F. Increasing healthcare utilization in the form of emergency visits, hospital admissions, and physician appointments related to the primary hospice diagnosis before seeking hospice benefit

**Part 2. Non-disease specific baseline guidelines (both points A and B must be satisfied).**

A. Physiologic impairment of functional status as interpreted via the Karnofsky Performance Status or Palliative Performance Score of less than 70 percent.

B. Individual needs assistance for greater than or equal to 2 ADL's: ambulation; transfer; dressing; feeding; continence; and bathing.

C. Comorbidities: when the condition is not the designated primary hospice diagnosis, the presence of significant disease thought to contribute to a prognosis of 6 months or less survival should be considered, such as

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Congestive heart failure (CHF)

- Ischemic heart disease

- Diabetes mellitus

- Neurologic disease (cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)

- Renal failure

- Liver disease

- Neoplasia

- Acquired immune deficiency syndrome/HIV

- Dementia

- Refractory severe autoimmune disease (e.g., lupus or rheumatoid arthritis)

- Recurrent sepsis
