Most cervical cancer treatments can be received as outpatients. Patients on active treatment should be educated about the side effects and symptoms to report. For instance, patients receiving chemotherapy should be educated about the potential for infection and when to report signs to the provider, as well as how to manage nausea. Patients receiving radiation therapy may need to know about expected side effects including dysuria, diarrhea, skin changes, and fatigue. After treatment is complete, a follow-up plan should be clearly communicated with the patients. Transitioning to survivorship may be an increased time of vulnerability for people with cancer, so nurses can play an important role in providing support and other resources.
