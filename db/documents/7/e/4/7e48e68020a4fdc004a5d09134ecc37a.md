The radial forearm free flap is an incredibly versatile option for head and neck reconstruction and is an excellent option when performed at the hands of an experienced microvascular surgeon. Otolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons, and plastic surgeons should regularly consider this reconstructive option for a myriad of tissue defects, and it is the responsibility of clinicians without microvascular training and expertise to refer the appropriate patient to such surgeons that can provide this excellent treatment option. Communication between nursing, anesthesia, and the surgeon should be a frequent theme throughout the preoperative, perioperative, and post-operative stages to achieve maximal benefit and minimal morbidity. The microvascular surgeon should have a thorough discussion with the patient regarding the surgery and its benefits, risks, and expectations to achieve an excellent outcome.
