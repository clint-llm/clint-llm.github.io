Radiation is recommended for vulvar cancer as adjuvant therapy for histology-confirmed metastatic disease and as primary therapy for locally advanced disease followed by radical resection of the residual tumor. When SLN biopsy is positive, it is acceptable to offer adjuvant radiation with or without chemotherapy or to perform a complete inguinal lymphadenectomy and offer adjuvant therapy only if high-risk features are identified; such as positive or close resection margins, multifocal disease, multiple involved nodes, or extracapsular extension. The latter approach is recommended especially if there are ≥2 positive nodes or 1 positive node with >2 mm metastasis.

In the case of locally advanced disease, primary chemoradiation is recommended, followed by radical resection of any residual disease.

In vulvar Paget’s disease, radiotherapy, or photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be considered as alternative treatment options to surgical resection.
