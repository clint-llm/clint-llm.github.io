Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare but very serious disorder. The overall prognosis depends on the ejection fraction. About 50-70% of patients have gradual improvement in ventricular function and symptoms by 6 months. However, embolic events carry a mortality of 30%. For women who survive, a second pregnancy should not be undertaken if the ejection fraction is low. Prior to a second pregnancy, the female should be thoroughly worked up with an echo or a stress test. Even patients with a complete recovery should be warned that the condition can recur again. The timing of delivery and management require an interprofessional approach and individualization of the patient.

The role of the obstetric nurse is critical. These patients need a thorough education on the subject so that they have realistic expectations. Most patients never consider that a pregnancy will be adversely affected, and when cardiomyopathy occurs, the patient and or the family usually blame the healthcare providers for lack of information.

Over the years, many guidelines have become available on the diagnosis and management of peripartum cardiomyopathy. Thus, all healthcare workers who look after these patients must be well informed about the treatment.

**Outcomes**

Women with a minimal decrease in ejection fraction tend to have a good prognosis, but those with a poor ejection fraction have a high risk of death. In addition, any female who requires an assist device tends to have adverse events and a low survival. A heart transplant is not always an option because of a lack of donors. In many cases, while the pregnant female may survive, the fetus may not. Given this morbid statistics, all healthcare workers should educate the patient and family about the disorder and its outcomes.
