De Quervain tenosynovitis is a relatively common disorder. The patient may present to a number of specialists including a hand surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, primary care provider or an emergency room physician. Nurses may come across this disorder at workers compensation clinic and at rehabilitation centers. Finally, some patients may present to a pharmacist and ask for a pain reliever. The key is to make the diagnosis promptly and avoid the morbidity of the condition.

For patients who seek treatment, the outcomes are excellent. For patients who don't get treatment, the resulting pain often results in disability. Surgery has the best outcomes however it is also associated with the potential of complications. Cortisone injections do work but recurrences are known to occur. In addition, with cortisone injections, the recovery may take 3-9 months.  All patients should avoid repetitive actions to prevent recurrence of symptoms. Some patients may need a change in the job and others may need to enroll in long-term hand rehabilitation exercises.
