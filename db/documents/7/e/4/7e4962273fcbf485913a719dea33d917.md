Endometrioid cancer develops in response to the exposure of endometrium to unopposed estrogen, which leads to hyperplasia and then dysplasia of the endometrial glands and hence is referred to as adenocarcinoma. Multiple studies have demonstrated a strong association between intrinsic factors that cause increased serum estrogen, e.g., obesity and type II diabetes mellitus with endometrial adenocarcinoma.

Extrinsic factors, e.g., estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy and tamoxifen, also increase the risk of developing endometrial adenocarcinoma. Serous carcinoma of the endometrium arises due to atrophy of the endometrium and is often linked to genetic mutations. Based on molecular patterns and estrogen sensitivity, there are two types of uterine cancer. Type I cancer is due to unopposed estrogen, while type II cancer is seen in postmenopausal women, is not estrogen-related, and carries a poorer prognosis. Mutations in PTEN, k-ras, and microsatellite instability inception are common in type I, while p53 and HER2/neu mutations are seen in type II.

This classification provides important information regarding therapeutics and prognosis as well. The most common mutation is in p53 and HER/neu and has a poor prognosis.
