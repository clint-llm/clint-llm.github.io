- Psittacosis pneumonia is a zoonotic infection caused by contact with birds infected by C. psittaci.

- Infection is caused by inhalation (including transient) of aerosolized particles from dried feces, respiratory secretions, bird bites, and feather dust.

- C. psittaci usually presents in young to middle-aged adults as a sudden fever with pulse-temperature dissociation, headache, myalgia, and dry cough. The physical exam may be remarkable for rales and rarely a pleural rub. Chest radiography may show single lobe changes, although multi-lobar changes are also possible.

- Infection may manifest with systemic involvement such as respiratory failure, endocarditis, myocarditis, encephalopathy, and/or hepatitis.

- Diagnosis is usually established clinically with the presence of fever, headache, dry cough, lobar changes on chest radiography, and recent exposure to birds- treatment should be initiated when suspected.

- Serologic testing is the gold standard for diagnosis. Cultures are highly discouraged and are only performed in specialized labs.

- Tetracyclines are first-line therapy. Tetracycline (500 mg PO 4 times per day) or doxycycline (100 mg PO or IV 2 times per day) for 7 to 10 days are recommended. Macrolides are second-line therapy, especially for children and pregnant women.
