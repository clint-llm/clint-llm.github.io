HLH has had two major shifts in classification in its lifetime. The first major classification system was defined in the seminal trial known as HLH-94 (representing the year participants began enrolling), and the more recent definition is referred to as HLH-2004 (again representing the year participants were enrolled in the most recent therapeutic trial). In the last 5 years, attempts to redefine the diagnostic criteria have occurred but are not as validated as either of their predecessors. The original HLH-94 criteria were the following: 5 out of 5 of the criteria must be met to establish a diagnosis.

- Fever 
- Cytopenias (at a minimal two lineages)
- Splenomegaly 
- Hypertriglyceridemia +/- hypofibrinogenemia 
- Biopsy-proven hemophagocytosis

In the HLH-2004 criteria, 3 further laboratory findings were added to the list. Diagnosis is established by the presence of at least 5 out of the now combined 8 total criteria.

- Ferritin greater than 500 ng/ml
- Low or absent NK-cell activity
- Elevated sIL2Ra levels greater than or equal to 2400 U/ml

Notably, per the HLH-2004 criteria, a diagnosis no longer requires the presence of biopsy-proven hemophagocytosis.
