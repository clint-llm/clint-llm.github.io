Paragangliomas have a diverse presentation, and their diagnosis can be difficult. Because they can occur anywhere in the body, management optimally employs an interprofessional team.

If anytimeÂ paragangliomas are suspected, an endocrinologist should be taken on board to complete the biochemical work up as well as localization of the tumor with radiological imaging or functional testing. Then the patient requires a referral to a specialized surgeon based on the location of the tumor and type of surgery. Some tumors like a pheochromocytoma need meticulous blood pressure management prior to surgery, and hence, the pharmacist should be involved. The patient should be educated about medication compliance to prevent malignant hypertension, which will enlist the services of an oncology specialty-trained nurse. These nurses are also invaluable before, during, and following the surgery, for preparation, assisting, and postoperative monitoring. Following surgery, nurses should carefully monitor the autonomic parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, diaphoresis, and fluid balance, and inform the oncologist/surgeon of any issues that arise. Open communication between interprofessional team members is vital to improving patient outcomes. [Level 5]
