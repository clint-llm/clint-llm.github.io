Aqueous humor circulation plays a significant role in IOP and, therefore, glaucoma. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with a global burden of 70 million people, 3 million of whom reside within the United States.

Screening patients for glaucoma via IOP measurement has been a controversial topic throughout the last decade. In 2013, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated its screening recommendation, citing a systematic review showing insufficient evidence to recommend glaucoma screening of primary care patients with normal vision.

The AAO made further recommendations for patients with diabetes mellitus or other risk factors for glaucoma. A yearly examination was recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes, beginning five years after disease onset. The annual examination was also recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes, beginning at diagnosis. Lastly, a biennial examination was recommended for any patient with risk factors for glaucoma, regardless of age. Risk factors for glaucoma include but are not limited to:

- High IOP

- Age over 60 years old

- Black, Hispanic, or Asian ethnicity

- Family history

Familial history of glaucoma is a known risk factor, but most cases are sporadic and likely multifactorial.

Current therapies for lowering IOP include increasing aqueous humor outflow and suppression of aqueous humor production, both of which may be achieved through various medications and surgical techniques.
