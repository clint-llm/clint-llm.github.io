Monitor patients for adverse outcomes based on assessment tools for determining risk level for opioid abuse, loss to treatment, diversion of drugs, adverse effects, and overdose.

Follow guidelines to monitor for more severe adverse effects such as QTc prolongation, drug interactions, and hypoglycemia:

- QTc Prolongation >450 ms

- 
              
- Obtain baseline electrocardiogram for all patients and repeat within 30 days to assess for acute changes. Repeat electrocardiogram annually.
              
              
- If the methadone dose exceeds 100 mg/dL or the patient is symptomatic, do further cardiac assessments.
              
              
- If the QTc interval exceeds 500 ms, reduce the methadone dose or discontinue, and use alternative therapy such as buprenorphine-naloxone.

- Drug interactions due to CYP3A4 metabolism

- 
              
- Methadone levels can be increased or decreased depending on the drug interaction precipitating either overdose or withdrawal symptoms.
              
              
- Monitor patients carefully on drugs that may affect clearance, watching out for signs of withdrawal or overdose.

- Hypoglycemia

- 
              
- Patients at high risk for this complication include cancer patients and patients who have a rapid dose escalation. Patients benefit from regular serum glucose screening. 
              
              
- Indications a patient is hypoglycemic include unexplained lethargy, perspiration, and palpitations.
