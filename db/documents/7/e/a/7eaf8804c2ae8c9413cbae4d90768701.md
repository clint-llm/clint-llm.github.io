The peroneal artery (also termed the fibular artery) is the posterior lateral branch of the tibial-peroneal trunk in the lower extremity just distal to the popliteal fossa.  The peroneal artery (along with the anterior tibial artery) is the vascular supply to the lateral compartment of the lower leg.  The three arteries of the lower leg are the peroneal artery, anterior tibial artery, and posterior tibial artery (the proximal aspect of the posterior artery is also know as the tibial-peroneal trunk).
