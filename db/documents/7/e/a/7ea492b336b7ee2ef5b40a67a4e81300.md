Syncope and cardiac dysrhythmias: When the glossopharyngeal nerve gets irritated, it sends feedback via the dorsal motor nucleus of the Xth nerve. These signals also stimulate the nucleus tractus solitarius in the midbrain. Thus, during the acute glossopharyngeal neuralgia attack, abnormal stimulation produces an amplified vagal response, resulting in bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac dysrhythmias. These autonomic changes cause cerebral hypoperfusion, slow waves on EEG, seizures, and syncope. Convulsive movements, limb clonus, automatic smacking movements of the lips, and upward turning of the eyes are signs of cerebral hypoxia.

Cardiovascular complications occur during painful episodes or immediately after the pain symptoms resolve. Management of glossopharyngeal neuralgia pain attacks with drugs and/or surgical treatment can help manage these complications. Some patients only develop cardiovascular manifestations of glossopharyngeal neuralgia without painful paroxysms, also known as non-neurologic glossopharyngeal neuralgia. These patients can receive therapy with glossopharyngeal nerve avulsion or microvascular decompression.
