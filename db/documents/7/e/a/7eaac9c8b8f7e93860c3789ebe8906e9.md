Prognosis is dependent on the timing of correct diagnosis as eosinophilic meningitis is rare and requires good clinical suspicion to suspect A. cantonensis as the cause as well as appropriate CSF findings. Sometimes the course of infection can be self-limiting, and other times depending on the disease burden may be fatal. There is an overall lack of national surveillance of this disease, and due to the limited diagnostic testing as well as poor general awareness among health care providers, it is difficult to quantify the outcomes.
