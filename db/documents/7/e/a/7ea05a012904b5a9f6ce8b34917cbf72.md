Anterior cord syndrome is an incomplete cord syndrome that predominantly affects the anterior 2/3 of the spinal cord, characteristically resulting in motor paralysis below the level of the lesion as well as the loss of pain and temperature at and below the level of the lesion. The patient presentation typically includes these two findings; however, there is variability depending on the portion of the spinal cord affected. Other findings include back pain, or autonomic dysfunction such as hypotension, neurogenic bowel or bladder, and sexual dysfunction. The severity of motor dysfunction can vary, typically resulting in paraplegia or quadriplegia. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of anterior cord syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of anterior cord syndrome.
- Summarize the typical evaluation of anterior cord syndrome.
- List the management options available for anterior cord syndrome.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance anterior cord syndrome and improve outcomes.
