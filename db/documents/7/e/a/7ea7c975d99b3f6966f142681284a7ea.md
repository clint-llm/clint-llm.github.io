Histologic examination of lipomas reveals mature, normal-appearing adipocytes with a small eccentric nucleus. Adipocytes are intermixed among thin fibrous septa containing blood vessels. These features are indistinguishable from adipocytes in the subcutaneous tissue. HistologicÂ subtypes of lipomas include angiolipomas, myelolipomas, angiomyolipomas, myelolipomas, fibrolipomas, ossifying lipoma, hibernomas, spindle cell lipomas, pleomorphic lipomas, chondroid lipomas, and neural fibrolipomas. Common lipomas and their variants must be distinguished from liposarcomas, which are a malignant lipomatous neoplasm containing lipoblasts, which are characterized by coarse vacuoles and one or more scalloped, hyperchromatic nuclei.
