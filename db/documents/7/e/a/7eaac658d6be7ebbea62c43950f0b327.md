Most open neural tube defects occur sporadically. however, several risk factors have been linked to neural tube defect development, including

- Chromosomal and genetic conditions:

- 
              
- Parent or sibling with neural tube defect
              
              
- Trisomies 18 and 13
              
              
-  Meckel-Gruber syndrome ( renal cysts, neural tube defects, and polydactyly).
              
              
-  Roberts, Jarcho-Levin ( high incidence in Puerto Rican, present with multiple defects in the spine and fan-like ribs anomalies)
              
              
- HARD syndrome (Hydrocephalus, agyria and retinal dysplasia),
              
              
- VACTERAL and VATER associations
              
              
- X-linked neural tube defects, among others.

- Amniotic bands that disrupt normal neural tube formation.

- Maternal environmental factors and exposure: alcohol use, caffeine intake, smoking, air pollution, disinfectant byproducts in drinking water, exposure to organic solvents, pesticides, nitrate-related compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, maternal fever or hyperthermia ( especially in the first trimester) from febrile illness or external sources like sauna, hot tub.

- Maternal medical conditions: elevated glycemic index, and gestational diabetes mellitus infections, obesity, and stress

- Maternal nutritional deficiencies, folate, methionine, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin B12, and choline.

- Maternal medications: various folic acid antagonists like valproic acid, carbamazepine, and methotrexate.
