**Pressure Injuries**

A potential complication in those undergoing prolonged long spine board and cervical spine motion restriction are pressure ulcers, with an incidence reported as high as 30.6%.

The amount of time it takes to develop a pressure injury varies, but at least one study demonstrated that tissue injury might begin in as little as 30 minutes in healthy volunteers.

**Respiratory Compromise**

Multiple studies have demonstrated a reduction in respiratory function due to the straps used on long spine boards. In healthy young volunteers, the use of long spine board straps over the chest resulted in a decrease of several pulmonary parameters, including forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, and forced mid-expiratory flow resulting in a restrictive effect.

**Pain**

The most common, well-documented complication of long spine board spinal motion restriction is pain, resulting in as little as 30 minutes. Pain is most commonly manifested with headaches, back pain, and mandible pain.
