Superficial cornea abrasions or foreign body injuries have a very good prognosis, especially if the visual axis is not involved. For anterior stromal scarring affecting the visual axis, excimer laser correction, or partial corneal transplantation are options for long-term visual rehabilitation. Greater than 50% conjunctival or >6 clocks hours of limbal involvement result in poor visual prognosis in ocular chemical burns.
