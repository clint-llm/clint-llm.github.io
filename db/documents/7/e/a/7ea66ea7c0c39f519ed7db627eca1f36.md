A full evaluation of suspected atypical moles can only be performed after complete excision since this facilitates full histological analysis.

Excision biopsy is generally considered to be the most appropriate method of assessment, since incision biopsy can miss areas of melanoma in situ lying within a specific area of the lesion, resulting in an incomplete picture of the lesion's microscopic features.

Dermoscopy may be used to evaluate the pigmentation patterns and secondary features of suspicious skin lesions. There are not presently any widely agreed criteria to distinguish atypical moles from melanoma in situ.

- **Reticular subtype:**the most common subtype, characterized by a prominent network of dark brown lines, distributed relatively evenly throughout the lesion and fading gradually towards the peripheral borders.

- **Globular subtype:**characterized by a globular speckled pattern, consisting of several dots distributed throughout the lesion.

- **Homogenous subtype:**the rarest subtype, characterized by variegated brown pigmentation, present throughout the lesion.

- **Mixed:**lesions displaying a combination of reticular and globular features. Clinicians should evaluate lesions that display characteristics of multiples subtypes particularly carefully since this may be more in keeping with a diagnosis of melanoma in situ.
