Patients may complain of pulsations in the neck and abdomen as the pulse wave travels back into the venous system. Other symptoms such as a headache, cough, and jaw pain can occur. Ask the patient for polyuria since increased atrial stress leads to higher BNP levels which in return will cause polyuria. Since Cannon A waves are associated with higher right atrial pressures. Erlebacher et al. describe that this may result in baroreceptor mediated systemic hypotension.

The inspection of jugular venous pulsation should be in conjunction with auscultation of the heart. Remember the relation of the venous pressure curve to the heart sounds. The A wave is followed closely by the S1 heart sound as the atrial contraction is followed by the closure of the atrioventricular valves.

The characteristic appearance of the neck vein pulsation is called frog sign according to Contreras-Valdes et al.

According to Ranjith et al., it is helpful to differentiate between regular and irregular Cannon waves since regular Cannon A waves might be caused by junctional rhythm or supraventricular tachycardia. Whereas, atrioventricular dissociation, ectopic atrial beats can result in irregular A waves.
