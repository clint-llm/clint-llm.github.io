Complications after undergoing cholecystectomy include the development of diarrhea or bloating due to alteration of biliary flow. There is also the possibility of having a cystic duct remnant that could potentially lead to stone formation and cause Mirizzi syndrome. In patients with stent placement during ERCP, it is crucial to ensure timely removal of the biliary stent within 3 to 6 months to prevent the development of occlusion, migration of the stent or cholangitis.
