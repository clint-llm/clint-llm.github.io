The goal of treating Kienböck disease is pain relief, wrist motion preservation, and preservation of grip strength.

Treatment of Kienböck disease depends on the stage of the disease and its causative factors. Stage I is always treated with splinting or cast immobilization. Stage II can also be treated with immobilization if necrosis is incomplete. Stages II with complete necrosis, III, and IV require "joint-leveling" surgery possibly coupled with vascular bone grafting or transfer of branches from adjacent arteries. Later stages with lunate collapse and secondary wrist degenerative arthrosis may also require proximal row carpectomy or intercarpal arthrodesis. Radial shortening osteotomy is the most common procedure performed to unload the lunate in cases with coexistent ulnar negative variance. Treatment may improve symptoms and functionality without affecting imaging findings in the advanced stages.
