Hip fractures are common injuries. Femoral neck fractures are a specific type of intracapsular hip fracture. The femoral neck connects the femoral shaft with the femoral head. The hip joint is the articulation of the femoral head with the acetabulum. The junctional location makes the femoral neck prone to fracture. The blood supply of the femoral head runs along the femoral neck and is an essential consideration in displaced fractures and patients in the younger population. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of femoral neck fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanisms of injury leading to femoral neck fractures, and identify the at-risk patient populations.
- Summarize the diagnostic approach for evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential femoral neck fracture, including any indicated imaging studies and potential differentials.
- Outline the treatment options for the reduction of femoral neck fractures, depending on patient population and fracture severity and location.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving communication to advance medical care and improve outcomes for femoral neck fractures.
