Differential diagnosis should include cardiogenic pulmonary edema as this is a cause of pulmonary edema that needs to be ruled out. In the appropriate clinical context with systemic inflammation, sepsis, or severe injury, evaluation for ARDS is necessary. HAPE should be a diagnostic option if the history shows a quick ascent in altitude. Medication and drug use should be reviewed to assess for salicylate toxicity and opioid overdose, as these often get overlooked as etiologies of pulmonary edema.

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

- Drug overdose from opioids and salicylates

- High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)

- Pulmonary embolism

- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
