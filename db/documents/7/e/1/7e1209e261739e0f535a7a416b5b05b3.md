The other causes of low vision in children should be ruled out, which include keratoconus, pediatric cataracts, microspherophakia, pediatric glaucoma, trauma, irido-fundal coloboma, nystagmus, congenital optic nerve abnormalities like optic disc coloboma, large myelinated nerve fibers involving the fovea, and congenital retinal anomalies, like pigmentary retinopathy. One should also enquire about the birth history, history of laser for retinopathy of prematurity, delayed cry at birth, and history of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Myopia can also be associated with Down syndrome (8 to 41%).

Marfan syndrome and Stickler syndrome: Pseudomyopia is the overestimation of myopia due to excessive accommodation usually seen in children. Hence, refraction done without cycloplegia overestimates myopia by -1 to -2 diopter.
