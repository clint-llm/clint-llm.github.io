Due to the routine use of ultrasonography (US) and β-hCG levels testing, patients with complete hydatidiform mole are commonly diagnosed early in gestation. They are usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Common clinical presentations include vaginal bleeding, which usually takes place at 6 to 16 gestational weeks (46%), large for date uterine size (24%), and hyperemesis (14%).

Patients with partial hydatidiform mole are usually not diagnosed before the uterine evacuation, and histological examination of curettage specimens after incomplete or missed abortion is required for the diagnosis. As with complete hydatidiform mole, the majority of patients with partial hydatidiform mole (75%) complain of vaginal bleeding; they generally present later than those with complete hydatidiform mole. Complete hydatidiform moles are typically associated with a considerably elevated β-hCG level. Nearly half of the patients with complete hydatidiform moles have pre-evacuation β-hCG levels higher than 100000 mIU/mL. Nonetheless, such elevated β-hCG levels happen in less than 10% of patients with partial hydatidiform mole.
