Initial pain from propofol injection occurs due to endothelial irritation.  Studies show that propofol initiates a cascade that leads to neurogenic inflammation in the spinal dorsal horn, which can cause injection pain to last 10 to 20 seconds.

When propofol reaches a toxic level, it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.  Propofol also inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase, which is a part of fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid accumulation can lead to arrhythmias and poor energy availability.   An imbalance of energy supply and demand can further lead to organ dysfunction throughout the body.
