Neonates that were discharged from the hospital early, with NBS obtained within the initial 24 hours of life, may have elevated TSH levels due to post-delivery TSH surge in response to cold stress after birth. This causes false-positive results and requires a second screening test. The ideal time to obtain NBS for CH is between 2 and 4 days of life when TSH levels have deceased.

Special considerations for premature infants: Premature infants may have hypothyroxinemia of prematurity, characterized by low free T4 and normal TSH, due to an immature HPT axis. Interpretation of TFT in premature infants is often challenging, as this thyroid profile can also be secondary to central hypothyroidism or complicated by non-thyroidal illness. Repeating TFT is recommended, as mentioned above. Most patients will have a normal TFT by 6 to 10 weeks.
