While older age is not a contraindication for neobladder reconstruction, elderly patients should be counseled that there is a higher risk for delayed recovery of urinary control and that they are at higher long term risk for nocturnal incontinence.

Patients with cognitive impairment, degenerative neurologic disease, or frailty should be counseled that continent diversions may require dexterity and attention beyond what may be available or possible from family members, caretakers, visiting nurses, or long term care facilities and they may better be served by an ileal conduit.

Approximately 10% of men and up to half of women require intermittent catheterization to adequately empty their neobladders. Therefore, poor manual dexterity, along with an unwillingness to perform or commit to self-catheterization, are contraindications to neobladder creation.

An orthotopic neobladder is contraindicated in patients with malignancy involving the urethra, either grossly or on intraoperative frozen sectioning. Such patients are at increased risk for urethral recurrence of the disease. Significant disease outside the bladder and plans for adjuvant radiation are also contraindications to neobladder creation.

Similarly, patients with chronic renal or hepatic insufficiency should not undergo orthotopic neobladder surgery. Chronic metabolic acidosis can lead to progressive kidney disease. Many centers use an estimated creatinine clearance of 35-40 ml/min as a minimal requirement for continent diversions.
