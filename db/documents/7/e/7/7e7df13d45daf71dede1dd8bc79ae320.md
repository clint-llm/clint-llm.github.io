Due to the high potential mortality of the malignant variant of atrophic papulosis, a collaborative approach is necessary for the management of these patients.

When physiciansÂ come across genetic skin disorders, the key is to refer them to a dermatologist for further workup. The disorder has associations with malignancies, and the referral should be without delay

Dermatologists must work in tandem with primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, and ophthalmologists to provide patients with the appropriate screening and health care of patients with malignant atrophic papulosis.

While there is no definitive pharmaceutical treatment for atrophic papulosis, the medications used in management should have pharmacist input, both for dosing as well as medication reconciliation, to minimize potential adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. The pharmacists should report any concerns to the managing clinician or the nursing staff for action.

Nursing will see the patient at every visit and can monitor for medication compliance, note treatment progress or lack thereof, and provide counsel and education to the patient and family. Again, this information must be shared with the entire health care team.

As can be seen from the above atrophic papulosis requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
