The oculocerebrorenal syndrome is caused by a mutation in the OCRL gene on chromosome Xq25-26. This gene encodes an inositol 5-phosphatase enzyme (OCRL-1), which is found primarily within clathrin-coated pits on the cell surface as well as within cellular organelles, particularly endosomes and the Golgi apparatus.

The enzyme converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate.

At least 200 mutations in the OCRL gene have been identified, most of which are frameshift, nonsense, and splice mutations. The OCRL variant type has not been shown to have a direct or reliable correlation with the phenotype or severity of the disease.

The OCRL gene mutation is transmitted in an X-linked recessive fashion, predominantly to males with a carrier mother. De novo OCRL mutations can arise in patients with no prior family history.OCRL gene do not have the classic features of oculocerebrorenal syndrome, they have characteristic lenticular changes that can be seen on ophthalmologic examination.
