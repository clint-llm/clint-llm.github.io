Physiologic variants of the falciform ligament are very rare. There have been a few case reports of obliteration of the falciform ligament where the liver appeared to lack the fissure the ligament usually creates. There have also been anatomic variants pertaining to structures carried in the falciform ligament, e.g., Â paraumbilical veins. However, most variants are not clinically significant and would most often be incidental findings during surgery or imaging used to help diagnose another condition.
