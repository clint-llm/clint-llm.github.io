Posterior polar cataract (PPC) is a unique subset of congenital cataract which forms a surgical challenge for all ophthalmologists.

PPC is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although sporadic occurrence has also been reported. Five genes have been linked with PPC.

The primary aim during surgery is to remove the PPC without a posterior capsular rent. This is achievable by alleviating the stress on the posterior capsule while performing the surgery. Various surgical techniques have been proposed for managing this unique entity, but a technique giving successful results without any complication remains a challenge for most surgeons.
