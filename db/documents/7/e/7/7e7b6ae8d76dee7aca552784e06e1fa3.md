Rhabdomyolysis is a state of muscle injury that can lead to several forms of systemic insult, with the most important being acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalance, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The systemic complications associated with rhabdomyolysis result from the leakage of muscle intracellular components into the bloodstream. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of rhabdomyolysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the potential etiologies of rhabdomyolysis.
- Outline the workup of a patient with rhabdomyolysis.
- Summarize the management options available for rhabdomyolysis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with rhabdomyolysis.
