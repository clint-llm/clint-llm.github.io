The etiology of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is unknown. Past history of head or neck trauma is reported in few cases but it is similar in migraine as well. Familial disposition for CPH has not been reported. Attacks of CPH are provoked by bending or rotating the head and also by applying external pressure against the transverse processes of vertebrae C4-C5, C2 root, or the greater occipital nerve.
