Pyocytis most likely occurs due to the inability of a defunctionalized bladder to expel the epithelial cells and debris that accumulate in the bladder without the flow of urine.

In a fully functional bladder, the flow of urine prevents the accumulation of debris and subsequent inflammatory and infective processes occurring. Causative organisms are frequently the same as those that most commonly cause lower urinary tract infections, such as E.coli and other gram-negative bacteria. Other common organisms include P. mirabilis, P. aeuginosa, and Enterococcus.

The bladder can becomeÂ defunctionalized either iatrogenically or physiologically. Physiological defunctioning occurs because of anuria secondary to end-stage renal failure. Iatrogenic defunctioning results from supravesical urinary diversion. Both result in a lack of urine flushing through the bladder, putting the patient at risk of pyocystis.
