Group B Streptococcus (GBS) commonly appears in up to 35% of healthy women's reproductive or gastrointestinal tracts. Pregnant women colonized with GBS can transmit the bacteria to their newborns at the time of birth. This infection can lead to neonatal sepsis and/or meningitis. Thus, it is essential to screen and understand the clinical presentations and treatments for GBS infections. This activity reviews the healthcare team's role in the background, presentation, prevention, evaluation, and treatment of Group B Streptococcus infections.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of group B Streptococcus (GBS) infections. 
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of group B Streptococcus infections.
- Review the management options available for group B Streptococcus infections. 
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the detection and treatment of group B Streptococcus (GBS) infections.
