Head trauma can result in a skull fracture and is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in children. It is a regular presentation in the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) and primary care. Children are more susceptible to head trauma and skull fracture than adults. A child's head size is approximately 18% of the total body surface area in infancy.  This will decrease to roughly 9% by adulthood.  Generally speaking, a child's skull is thinner and more pliable, thus providing less protection to the brain.
