Patients arriving at the emergency department with drug intoxication present unique challenges to the providing healthcare team. Since the differential diagnosis of LSD intoxication, let alone any drug intoxication, is an exhaustive list, a strong emphasis on obtaining a thorough history and physical exam is of paramount importance. This process starts with EMTs and paramedics, if applicable, the physicians and nurses, and the pharmacists preparing drugs, since the administration of a drug to control a patient's autonomic symptoms can interact, sometimes fatally, with the substances already present in their serum.

Although LSD is one of the most well-known illegal drugs, numerous drug analogs have been "designed" to offer many of the same effects of the substances currently outlawed by the government, that many individuals like those on a healthcare team do not have sufficient knowledge of these. Education about current and past designer drugs may be of great benefit to those working in healthcare when the source of intoxication is under question, or completely unable to be elucidated.
