# Introduction

The concept of contrast is the foundation upon which imaging rests. Contrast is simply the ability to distinguish two objects. In medical imaging, it allows adjacent substances or tissue to be distinguishable and visualized. Contrast allowed Marie Curie to identify her bones from the outline of her hand.

The optimal use of contrast will depend on the modality and physics of the imaging system. Radiographs and consequently computed tomography (CT) reflect how a target tissue depletes an energy signal as it passes through the tissue. The variables contributing to the signal loss include both the energy beam’s and the target’s physical properties.

Various types of contrast media are useful in medical imaging. The two largest groups include CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agents. The contrast groups are not interchangeable. Additional, less commonly utilized contrast agents, including fluoroscopy-based air or CO2, and molecular imaging (nuclear imaging), will not be discussed in depth here.

# Anatomy

The injection of intravenous contrast typically occurs through peripherally inserted IV catheters. Larger catheters in larger veins allow a faster rate of administration and larger volumes of contrast to be delivered. The most common site for placement of the IV catheter is the antecubital fossa. This location tolerates sizes adequate for the use of power injectors. Power injectors are machines often built into or controlled by the CT scanner that injects the contrast at a preselected rate, length of time, and volume to meet needed imaging requirements for the desired clinical question. The utilization of power injectors depends on the gauge of the catheter and the flow limits. More distal IV locations often do not tolerate 14 to 20 gauge needles and, if utilized, see a higher rate of contrast extravasation and associated complications.

As in contrast injection, the timing of image acquisition can be hand-selected by a technologist.

The homogenous distal venous opacification is much more variable than central arterial opacification because more patient factors come into play. Most studies take place at a set time interval after contrast administration. An alternative method that has lower variability sets at trigger once a targeted area enhances beyond the selected threshold and then starts the imaging.

For pathology in the upper extremity, contrast should be injected in the contralateral side to prevent confounding venous enhancement or streak artifact.

# Plain Films

Intravenous contrast is no longer routinely used in the evaluation of plain films (radiographs). IV pyelograms were previously used to evaluate the urinary collecting system but are now considered inferior to their CT equivalent.

# Computed Tomography

**CT Intravenous Contrast**

Intravenous contrast for CT is the most commonly used contrast agent overall. X-ray beams rely on energy passing through tissue, with some of the energy getting deflected or absorbed. The difference in the resulting rays or shadows creates an amplitude-dependent picture. The tissue modifies the energy beam or x-ray through scattering and absorption. Iodine is an element used in contrast media that utilizes both methods and subsequently changes the x-ray.

Early binding agents used for iodine were high osmolality agents, with their osmolality often exceeding 1500 mosm/kg H2O, approaching 5 to 8 times that of normal human serum, 290 mosm/kg H2O. Due to multiple side effects, by the mid-1990’s these agents declining in use in favor of low-osmolality (less than three times the osmolality of normal human serum) or even iso-osmolar agents.

The addition of IV contrast media increases the density and thus attenuation of the blood with which it mixes. The appearance of IV contrast will depend on the timing and contrast concentration. The iodinated blood results in signal loss or opacification. Early timing reveals undiluted or minimally diluted medium as it gets injected through the veins, and the attenuation of energy may be so great as to cause streak artifact. As it moves centrally, more blood mixes with the medium. As time passes, the contrast becomes progressively diluted as it passes into the arteries, tissues, and then distal peripheral veins. It obtains equilibration within several minutes before being filtered then secreted, predominantly through the urinary system. Modern contrast agents diffuse quickly, and the mixing of iodinated and non-iodinated blood is more related to blood flow than diffusion properties.

The appearance of tissues in a contrast-enhanced study depends on the timing of image acquisition relative to the contrast bolus. This timing depends on the pathology of interest or study indication.

**Contrast-Induced Nephropathy**

Early studies of contrast safety and efficacy quickly established links to contrast use and a decline in renal function. This association, once widespread, has come under scrutiny in the last few decades.

- Serum creatinine increase 0.3 mg/dl

- Increase in serum creatinine 50%

- Urine output of less than 0.5 ml/kg/hr for at least 6 hours.

Many of the early study design flaws that overrepresented CIN are just now being corrected. Inadequate risk factor identification and subsequent control groups have been the most cited cause of misleading associations. The early studies had their basis on high osmolality contrast, a contrast medium no longer used that has a higher side effect profile. Many of the early studies predominantly utilized patients undergoing heart catheterization, a procedure associated with significant embolic and nephrotoxic risk in addition to the contrast use.

The creation of a randomized controlled study to describe CIN has proven difficult, if not impossible, to employ.

Estimates are that it takes approximately 20 hours for normally functioning kidneys to clear contrast. The concern that increased contrast levels may have a nephrotoxic effect has led to the idea of waiting 24 hours between contrasted studies; however, no studies have adequately addressed this concept. In a patient with no renal function, no CIN is possible; however, for those in late-stage renal disease still producing urine, the patient may still be at increased risk. While the true risk of CIN or PC-AKI is yet fully delineated, contrast use will likely increase as contrast agents improve, and researchers continue to report low levels of CIN.

**Contrast Allergy**

Like CIN, the rates of contrast allergy have dynamically varied.

The American College of Radiology has classified reactions into two basic categories; physiologic and allergic-like reactions, and each category subdivide into mild, moderate, and severe. The physiologic reactions often occur as secondary to pain, vasovagal, ionotropic, infusion sensation, and neurologic. While often seen as benign and dependent on the dose, these physiologic reactions can be deadly with seizures or life-threatening hypotension and arrhythmia.

While a type 1 or IgE response mediates most allergies, only 50% of severe contrast have a corresponding skin test; this suggests an alternative or histamine-dependent pathway.

The treatment for acute contract reactions depends on the presenting symptom, and radiologists and emergency physicians are typically well-versed. Treatment paradigms should include but not be limited to bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, hypotension, anaphylactic reactions, pulmonary edema, hypertensive crisis, seizures, hypoglycemia, and anxiety. Example treatment paradigms are in the ACR Manual on Contrast Media.

The combination of allergic and physiologic reactions associated with low osmolality contrast mediums is low, with reports varying between 0.2 and 0.7%.

**Pretreatment Algorithms**

Pretreatment algorithms are focused on multiple doses of steroids with a small period to permit steroid efficacy and an additional dose of antihistamine before contrast injection. An estimated 4 to 6 hours are required before steroids can mitigate allergic-type reactions, and the most cited algorithm has a 13-hour protocol.

- Prednisone 50 mg PO, 13, 7, and 1 hour before the scan. Diphenhydramine 50 mg PO/IV/IM 1 hour before the scan.

- Methylprednisolone 32 mg PO 13 and 2 hours before the scan. Diphenhydramine 50 mg PO/IV/IM 1 hour before the scan.

- Methylprednisolone 40 mg IV or hydrocortisone 200mg IV every 4 hours for at least two doses of diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 1 hour before the scan.

- Dexamethasone 7.5 mg IV or betamethasone 6 mg IV every 4 hours for at least two doses. Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 1 hour before the scan.

Even with pretreatment, estimates are that 12% of patients with prior reactions will have breakthrough reactions; however, the severity is typically similar or less than previous responses.

**Metformin Use**

Metformin is a medication commonly used to manage diabetes. Metformin use is associated with lactic acidosis, a potential side effect exacerbated by poor renal function. If patients are appropriately screened for contraindications to include renal function, no special precautions are warranted. Since there is a risk of CIN or PC-AKI with contrast use, the development of new or worsened renal dysfunction can merit altering a patient’s metformin use until such dysfunction is ruled out to prevent lactic acidosis.

**Other IV Contrast Complications and Considerations**

Contrast extravasation occurs in 0.1% to 1% of IV contrast administrations, with the most common correlating risk factor being peripheral wrist or distal leg IV injection site.

Myasthenia gravis exacerbations have correlated with contrast administrations.

Intravenous contrast does cross the placenta and is detectable within the fetus.

Similarly, contrast is found secreted in breast milk in low doses, with only a small amount of ingested contrast getting absorbed.

# Magnetic Resonance

**MRI Contrast**

While iodine-based contrast directly affects the passage of the signal through the target material, gadolinium indirectly changes the signal measured in the surrounding water. MRI signal is detected by subtle variances of the magnetic fields created by the orientation of water molecules. A large magnetic field aligns these molecules; then, they are subject to radio pulses, which modulate the orientation and angulation and measurable signal. After the radio pulse, the water molecules start to realign themselves with the MRI magnet field, and the T1 and T2 signals can be measured, which gradually tapers through a period known as relaxation time.

Like iodine, gadolinium is toxic with properties similar to calcium. It is attached to a chelating molecule that mitigates its harmful effect while allowing it to alter the MRI signal of the surrounding water.

**Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis**

In the late 1990's gadolinium-based intravenous contrast MRI studies were on the rise, and similarly, reports of a strange skin disease arose that confounded researchers. While it baffled many scientists for years, eventually, an association with gadolinium-based contrast and poor renal function was made.

NSF was eventually found to be associated with reduced renal function, and the FDA put a black box warning on gadolinium-based drugs.

Additional factors have been shown to increase the risk of NSF to include AKI in the setting of chronic renal dysfunction, concomitant hepatic dysfunction, repeated boluses of contrast, a high volume of contrast, hypertension requiring medical therapy, diabetes, and patients undergoing dialysis.

**Gadolinium Allergy**

Like iodinated contrast, intravenous gadolinium injections correlate with allergic-like and physiologic-like reactions, with a majority of constituting physiologic reactions. Allergic reactions are believed to be equal or less than those of iodinated contrast, with rates published between 0.004 and 0.7%.

The rate of contrast extravasation is less than those of CT, with supportive care being adequate for almost all patients.

**Gadolinium in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Gadolinium is detectable in the fetus and breast milk after intravenous injection. The effects of intrauterine gadolinium administration are not well known; thus, gadolinium-based contrast is generally avoided whenever possible while pregnant.

# Ultrasonography

Current interest in the imaging capabilities of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is mostly limited to academic institutions. One of the most significant advantages is the lack of renal injury associated with contrast use when compared to CT contrast or MRI-based contrast.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound permits real-time evaluation of the enhancement characteristics allowing targeted assessment of the wash-in and washout kinetic patterns. There is ongoing research to determine the imaging characteristics of different masses; many parallel enhancement patterns are seen on CT and MRI. While initially used as a screening tool, requiring CT or MRI for complete characterization, contrast-enhanced ultrasound has the potential to diagnose more pathologies in the future definitively.

# Nuclear Medicine

The image acquisition of nuclear medicine is vastly different from CT and MRI. While contrast mediums act upon the imaging signal, injected radiopharmaceuticals are the imaging source and are not acted upon by intravenous mediums. Nuclear medicine does utilize CT and MRI imaging for SPECT-CT, PET-CT, and PET-MRI; each may be contrast-enhanced to improve the specificity of selected pathologies.

# Angiography

Classically, angiography has referred to studies done under fluoroscopy; however, the advent of rapid CT image acquisition has led to CT angiography. Classic angiography is now predominantly found in the interventional radiology suite and the cardiac catheter lab. CT angiography is often utilized because it is faster, costs less, and is less user-dependent. The sensitivity of CT vs. fluoroscopic evaluation depends on the indication. The spatial resolution is higher with fluoroscopic angiography; however, the ability to define surrounding structures or contrast resolution is far superior to CT. While many studies came from the fluoroscopy suite, CT angiography has become the standard in many situations.

The use of IV contrast in CT angiography relies on the combination of contrast enhancement curve and timing of the study. Fluoroscopic evaluation utilizes small intravascular boluses administered in real-time by a physician. The real-time evaluation allows the physician to adapt the study to the findings, allowing targeted evaluation of multiple areas and more judicious use of contrast. CT temporal resolution is limited to a few time points that can be assessed but can cover larger areas with the larger boluses utilized.

MRI angiography, like CT angiography, is quickly becoming clinically advantageous. A classic scenario is the MRI of the head and neck to evaluate vasculature following a transient ischemic attack. One advantage of utilizing MRI is that some vasculature can be evaluated without contrast, utilizing the flow properties of moving blood.

# Patient Positioning

The positioning of patients in contrast-enhanced CT or MRIs is limited to the obstruction of vascular flow and the layering of extravascular contrast. The positioning of arms is often changed to prevent signal loss and increased doses. Technicians must take care when positioning the arms to prevent the compression of vascular structures, especially on the limb through which injection occurs. Compressed limbs cause increased extravasation and poor contrast bolus formation.

Evaluation of the urological system utilizes extracted contrast to evaluate the ureters and bladder. The normal peristalsis will limit the evaluation of the ureters, and multiple time points may be an option before the complete pacification of the ureters. As contrast fills the bladder, there will be mixing artifacts and possible layering of dense contrast. To minimize mixing artifact to allow the most sensitive evaluation for the bladder wall, the patient is often asked to roll several times. In non-mobile patients, the inability to mix contrast within the bladder may lead to inconclusive or false-positive studies.

# Clinical Significance

The usage of contrast media has increased the sensitivity and specificity of many exams. While not all conditions merit the use of contrast, ordering physicians should be aware of the risks. The risk of PC-AKI (CIN) and NSF are most evident for those with an eGFR at or below 30, and caution is advised. While undergoing contrast administration, patients should be monitored for reactions with nurses, technologists, and physicians aware of how to identify and treat potentially life-threatening reactions. The history of a prior reaction may merit pretreatment of at least 5, or possibly 13 hours. The use of contrast in a pregnant population is limited, but in lactating women, no pause in breastfeeding is required.
