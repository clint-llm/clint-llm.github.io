In each of the above cases, an investigation was undertaken to determine the cause and prevent a recurrence of each event. While the pin index safety system (PISS) is only used on smaller cylinders, the success of this system was eventually adapted to larger systems, resulting in some countries requiring even larger cylinders to be pin-indexed. The crossing of pipelines in hospitals has resulted in more oversight by maintenance crews, and the mislabeling of canisters has since been addressed. While this system has been designed to improve safety, the system also relies upon clinical oversight of medical equipment, staff vigilance, and careful monitoring of anesthesia gas delivery to patients.
