Intravenous and inhalation of cyanide produce a more rapid onset of signs and symptoms than exposure via the oral or transdermal route. This is due to the first two routes providing fast diffusion into the bloodstream. The toxicity of cyanide is linked mainly to the cessation of aerobic cell metabolism. Cyanide reversibly binds to the ferric ions cytochrome oxidase three within the mitochondria. This effectively halts cellular respiration by blocking the reduction of oxygen to water.

Cyanide's main effect is that it inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, a process where oxygen is utilized for the production of essential cellular energy sources in the form of ATP. It does so by binding to the enzyme cytochrome C oxidase and blocks the mitochondrial transport chain. After that, cellular hypoxia and the depletion of ATP occur, leading to metabolic acidosis. The utilization of oxygen by the tissue occurs and is followed by the impairment of vital functions.
