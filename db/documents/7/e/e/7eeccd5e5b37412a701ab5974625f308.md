Migraine and headache disorders are among the leading causes of disability and morbidity worldwide.

Up to 18% of patients in the pediatric emergency room are found to be migraine-related.

The diagnosis of migraine in children and adolescents remains a clinical diagnosis. The clinician must obtain a detailed and comprehensive headache history that focuses on the location, quality, severity, and duration of the pain.Â Nonetheless, complicated migraine is often associated with focal neurological symptoms such as ataxia, hemiparesis, or altered level of consciousness that concerns the examining clinician. Some episodic syndromes may show ambiguity, such as migraine triggered by trauma.

Acute treatment recommendations for children include using over-the-counter analgesics and triptan medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Preventive treatment strategies involve lifestyle modifications, behavioral approaches, and consideration of preventive medications with the lowest side effect profiles.
