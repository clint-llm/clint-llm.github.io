Ketone is a name for a specific elemental structure in organic chemistry. A ketone consists of a single bond to two CH3 or R groups with a double bond to an oxygen molecule. Acetone, 3-B-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), and acetoacetate all contain a ketone group and are therefore very soluble in the body tissues. The solubility of these ketones allows for transport through the body to various tissues.

The important rate-limiting steps in ketone metabolism include hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl CoA carboxylase, succinyl CoA-oxoacid transferase (SCOT), and HMG CoA synthase. HSL and HMG CoA synthase are inhibited by insulin and stimulated by glucagon. Acetyl CoA carboxylase is stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon. All three of these enzymes have the same effect of slowing down ketone production in the presence of insulin and increasing it in the presence of glucagon. Finally, increased levels of acetoacetate in the mitochondria of target organs inhibit SCOT and therefore inhibit ketone metabolism.
