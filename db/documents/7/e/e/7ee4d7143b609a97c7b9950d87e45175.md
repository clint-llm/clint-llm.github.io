Alpha thalassemia is a fairly common monogenic blood disorder found worldwide. The production of alpha globins is regulated by four alpha genes located on chromosome 16. Alpha thalassemia is usually caused by the affected allele's reduced (α+) or complete absence (α°) of globin chain production.

The carrier state can either be α+ trait (α-thalassemia 2- a result of one alpha-globin gene deletion) or α°-trait (α-thalassemia 1- a result of the deletion of the two α globin genes). α-Thalassemia 2 is an asymptomatic carrier state. The other two types of alpha thalassemia are HbH (deletion of three alpha-globin genes) and alpha-thalassemia major or Hb Barts (deletion of all four alpha-globin genes).

Thalassemias can be easily confused with iron deficiency anemias which are to be ruled out. Several laboratory diagnostic tests like complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin (Hb) analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or electrophoresis can be of help here. Also, managing disease, parental counseling, ante-natal diagnosis, newborn screening, and prevention of future complications are key factors for improving the quality of life of the patients and their families.

More advanced diagnostic techniques for molecular analysis of alpha thalassemia mutations like allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse dot blot (RDB) analysis, real-time PCR, and DNA sequencing play a pivotal role here.
