Assessment of the lower eyelid laxity should be done systematically, including evaluation of the skin envelope, lower eyelid position, fat compartments, tarsoligamentous laxity, and midface.

**Skin**

The skin of the lower eyelid and the periorbital area should be assessed for signs of sun damage, rhytids, laxity, edema, festoons, and associated pathologies such as xanthelasma. Skin laxity should be assessed while the patient looks up and while he opens his mouth. On each occasion, the surgeon will perform a pinch test to look for excess skin that can be excised. Moreover, patients with preoperative malar edema should be warned about the risk of postoperative swelling.

**Lower Eyelid Position**

The lower eyelid position, which is normally at or just above the inferior corneal limbus, should be documented in millimeters. Causes of retraction such as previous eyelid surgery, thyroid orbitopathy, and previous facial burn should be further assessed. Examiner should also look for the presence of Bell's phenomenon (the eye moves up when the patient attempt to close his eyes while the examiner is holding the lids open).

**Fat Compartments**

The prominence of any of the three fat compartments (lateral, central, and medial) should be noticed and documented with preoperative photography. There should be five views in sitting and standing positions. It should include a close-up view of the eyes when closed, open at rest, when looking upward, and when looking to the sides. Looking upward usually accentuates the medial and central fat pads, whereas looking to the contralateral side may accentuate the medial pocket.

**Tarsoligamentous Laxity**

The lateral canthus inserts 2mm superior to the medial canthus (canthal tilt). In the case of later canthal tendon laxity, this attachment may stretch or even disinsert, changing the lateral canthus level to the same level as the medial canthus. Moreover, the distance between the lateral canthal tendon and the lateral orbital rim, which is usually between 2 and 3 mm, can increase. This can give a C-shaped rather than a V-shaped lateral canthal angle.

The most common cause of postoperative lower lid malposition is failure to recognize lower lid laxity preoperatively.  A lid distraction test (Snapback test) is performed by gently pulling the middle part of the lower eyelid outward, displacing the lid from the globe. In normal lids, it should immediately spring back into the globe. This can be divided into four grades.[21]

- Grade 0: normal lid

- Grade I: takes 2 or 3 seconds

- Grade II: takes 4 or 5 seconds

- Grade III: takes more than 5 seconds but returns to its normal position with blinking

- Grade IV: Never returns back to the normal position.

The lid retraction is another test to assess the lower eyelid tone and the stability of the medial and lateral canthi. This can be done by a gentle downward pull of the lower eyelid towards the inferior orbital rim and observation of the puncta and lateral canthus position. Movement of more than 2 mm of the puncta from the medial canthus indicates laxity of the canthal tendon. Moreover, a slow return of the lid to the resting position opposing the globe is another indication of lower lid laxity.

Medial canthal tendon laxity can also be assessed by gently pulling the lower eyelid laterally while the patient is looking straight ahead and observation of the punctum. Normally, the displacement should be limited to 0 to 1 mm, and it can also be divided into four grades.

- Grade 0: normal lid

- Grade I: 2 mm displacement

- Grade II: 3 mm displacement

- Grade III: more than 3mm displacement

- Grade IV: does not return to the normal position after blinking

Similarly, the lateral canthal corner should only move 2 mm when pulled the lower eyelid is pulled medially. It can also be divided into four grades.

- Grade 0: normal lid (0 to 2 mm displacement of the lateral canthal corner)

- Grade I: 2 to 4 mm

- Grade II: 4 to 6 mm

- Grade III: more than 6 mm

- Grade IV: does not return to the normal position after blinking.

Slit-lamp examination is useful to assess the corneal status and any evidence of dryness. It can be used to check the presence of punctum eversion or stenosis. Furthermore, it can measure the MDR-1 (margin to reflex distance: the distance from the upper lid margin to the corneal reflex, which usually measures 3 to 4 mm) and MRD2 ( the distance between the lower lid margin and the corneal reflex, which is usually between 3 to 5 mm). Assessment of visual acuity using a Snellen chart is another crucial part of the examination.

**M****idface**

The corneal surface is at the same level as the malar prominence. If the cheek is recessed, it is a negative vector or negative malar angle. These patients are at a higher risk of postoperative lower eyelid malposition, and lateral canthal support is always needed when performing lower blepharoplasty. Examiners should also look for signs of aging midface such as tear trough, nasojugal groove, and deepening of the nasolabial fold.
