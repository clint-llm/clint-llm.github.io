GI infectious diseases can cause mucosal inflammation which represents various patterns of tissue response. Histologic patterns of GI infections can be classified as follows:

- Infections producing minimal or no histologic changes (e.g., Vibrio species)

- Infections producing nonspecific inflammation (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni)

- Infections with suggestive/diagnostic features (e.g., pseudomembranes, etc.)

Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp, Salmonella spp, Yersinia and E. coli and few other pathogens all have resembling histopathology. The histopathological picture shows a thick layer of mucosa and cluster of bacteria plus neutrophils in the intraepithelial surface; neutrophils accumulate in the lumen and the basal part of the intestinal crypts as well.
