Osmolality indicates the concentration of all the particles dissolved in body fluid. It is routinely measured in clinical laboratories for the differential diagnosis of disorders related to hydrolytic balance regulation, renal function, and small-molecule poisonings.

The 1975 Dorwart and Chalmers formula, serum osmolality = 1.86(Na) + (glucose/18) + (BUN/2.8) + 9, had been often used to calculate plasma osmolality.

The normal serum osmolality should range from 275 to 295 mOsm/kg.
