The prevalence of delirium is higher in the elderly population. It is a common surgical complication among older adults, with an incidence reported up to 10 to 20% after major elective surgery and up to 50% after high-risk procedures. Postoperative delirium is associated with a 7 to 10% increased risk of 30-day mortality and increases hospital stay by 2 to 3 days.

Delirium in the general population increases health care utilization and is associated with increased complications and poor outcomes. The total health care cost attributable to delirium is estimated at $164 billion annually. In patients presenting to the emergency department with delirium, there is a 70% increased risk of death at six months, and delirium in the ICU is associated with a 2 to 4-fold increased risk of overall mortality.
