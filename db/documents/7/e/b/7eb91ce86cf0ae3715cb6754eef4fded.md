Prognosis of thrombosis varies depending on which type of thrombosis (venous or arterial), the location of the thrombosis, severity/extent of thrombosis, the persistence of provoking risk factors and comorbidities, and whether the first or subsequent/recurrent episode of thrombosis.  Patients with venous thromboembolism are at a higher risk than the general population for recurrent VTE, especially if they have underlying provoking risk factors. Up to 25% of patients who have experienced VTE may encounter a recurrent venous thrombosis within 10 years.
