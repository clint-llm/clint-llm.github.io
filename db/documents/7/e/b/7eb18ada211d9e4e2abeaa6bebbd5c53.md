The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a structure found within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Its composition has two components: the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The SER is generally used for the creation/ storage of lipids and steroids, while the RER plays a significant role in the synthesis of various proteins. The RER is termed "rough" due ribosomal attachments toÂ the surface compared to the SER, which does not have ribosomes.
