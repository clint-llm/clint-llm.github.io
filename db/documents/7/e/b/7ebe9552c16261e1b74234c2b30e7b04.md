Disruption of the stability of the nasal valves from surgery or trauma may disrupt airflow dynamics or cause airway collapse or obstruction. A number of surgical techniques are available for nasal valve repair, including spreader grafts, butterfly grafts, and alar batten grafts. Hypertrophy of the anterior inferior turbinates is a common cause of nasal airway obstruction and can be present concurrently with nasal septal deviation and/or nasal valve collapse.
