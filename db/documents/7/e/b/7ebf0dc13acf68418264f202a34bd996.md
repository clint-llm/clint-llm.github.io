The exact pathophysiology of peripheral neuropathy is contingent on the underlying disease. Although a wide assortment of distinct diseases can ultimately lead to peripheral neuropathies, the mechanisms in which peripheral nerves suffer injury exhibit similar patterns. These reactions include segmental demyelination, along with Wallerian and axonal degeneration.

- Segmental Demyelination: This process refers to the process of degeneration of the myelin sheath, with sparing of the nerve axon. This type of reaction can present in mononeuropathies, sensorimotor, or, principally, motor neuropathies. These are often inflammatory and sometimes immune-mediated. About 20% of symmetrical peripheral neuropathies result from damage to the myelin. Examples include Charcot-Marie-Tooth and neuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

- Wallerian Degeneration: This occurs after a nerve axon degenerates due to a lesion or physical compression; the portion distal to the axon passively wastes away, likely due to a lack of nutrients from the cell body. This reaction results in focal mononeuropathy that is secondary to trauma or infarction of the nerve.

- Axonal Degeneration, also known as the dying-back phenomenon: This type of degeneration usually manifests as symmetrical polyneuropathy (around 80%) and tends to cause weakness, most notably weakness in dorsiflexion of the ankles and foot, with accompanied trophic changes to muscle. The axon degenerates in a pattern that starts distal and progresses proximally; this is thought to be because the most distal portion of the axon is particularly vulnerable due to its distance from the cell body, which provides metabolic support.
