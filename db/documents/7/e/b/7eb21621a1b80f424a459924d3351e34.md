MELAS is a mitochondrial inherited genetic disorder. Paternal mitochondria are present only in the tailpiece of the sperms. As a result, they are lost during fertilization and mitochondrial disorders including MELAS are maternally inherited. In rare instances, MELAS may result from a sporadic mutation with no family history. Mitochondrial genetic disorders are the result of mutations causing impaired mitochondrial function, including oxidative phosphorylation and energy production. In MELAS, mutations in tRNA are believed to cause impairment of protein assembly into respiratory chain complexes, though the exact mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Mitochondria are the powerhouse of cells. Any mitochondrial disorder will affect the most metabolically active organs of the body especially the brain and muscles.

Many different transfer RNA (tRNA) mutations can cause MELAS. The most common mutation is in the MTTL1 mitochondrial gene. A single base pair mutation, m.3243A>G, is found in 80% patients, and a second common mutation, m.3271T>C, is found in 10%.

The neurological symptoms of MELAS are believed to result from a combination of impaired mitochondrial energy production, microvascular angiopathy, and nitric oxide deficiency, which may cause impaired cerebral vasodilation.
