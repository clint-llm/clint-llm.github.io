Pasteurella multocida is the most common cause of soft tissue infection in humans following bites or scratches from dogs and cats.P. multocida typically results in soft tissue infection. However, respiratory and other serious invasive infections such as bacteremia, meningitis, and endocarditis may also occur, especially in the elderly, immunocompromised, and neonates.P. multocida infections are almost universally penicillin-sensitive, making this the first-line treatment. In rare cases of penicillin resistance, cephalosporins (2nd and 3rd generation), fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines can be used.
