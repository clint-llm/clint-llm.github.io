The number of men, women, and children in the U.S. carrying the Toxoplasma parasite exceeds 40 million, but most of them are asymptomatic. Worldwide, more than 60% of some populations are infected with Toxoplasma. Seroprevalence is variable between different regions of the world, being more prevalent in tropical areas. Toxoplasmosis is considered to be the most common parasitic infections of humans. Seropositivity increases with age in all geographical areas. The rates of infection are often higher in regions that have hot, humid climates and lower altitudes because oocysts grow faster and survive better in such an environment. The incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis depends upon the time of acquisition of Toxoplasma infection of pregnant women and their prior infection state at the time of exposure. Congenital CMV is the only transplacentally acquired infection more common than congenital toxoplasmosis. In the United States, congenital toxoplasma infection rates among live-born newborns are from 1 in 3000 to 1 in 10000.
