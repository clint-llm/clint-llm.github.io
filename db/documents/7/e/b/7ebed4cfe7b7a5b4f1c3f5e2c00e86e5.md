Aortic transection occurs most commonly due to blunt thoracic trauma. The common mechanisms that result in the injury pattern are motor vehicle collision, pedestrian struck by a vehicle, and fall, in decreasing order. In an autopsy study of patients that experienced blunt thoracic trauma, the average age of the patient was 43 years, and they were 71% male. Close to 40% of the victims were intoxicated at the time of injury.
