One of the primary adverse effects is the risk of a life-threatening increase in serotonin when combined with certain antidepressants and the inhibition of monoamine oxidase. Using the supplement with other antidepressant medications may cause serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome may first cause tachycardia, increased blood pressure, mydriasis, and sweating. Some may have a fever, and temperatures can rise above 106 degrees F. Treatment can include serotonin antagonists and a benzodiazepine to target GABA receptors. Increased blood pressure can receive treatment with short-acting antihypertensives.
