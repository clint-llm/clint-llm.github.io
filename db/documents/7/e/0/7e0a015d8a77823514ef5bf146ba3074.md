The clinician must discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patient and obtain informed consent. The patient should be monitored using continuous EKG, continuous pulse oximetry, and blood pressure cuff cycling every 5 minutes. The patient should have IV access before the procedure. Position the patient supine and uncover the abdomen. Be sure to thoroughly clean the skin over the anterolateral abdomen, from the costal margin to iliac crest, followed by placement of sterile towels surrounding the border of the procedural field. A procedural time-out should take place prior to starting the procedure.
