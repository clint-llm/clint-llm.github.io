Median nerve injury most commonly occurs from posture or workplace ergonomics, direct trauma, or physiological conditions such as pregnancy.

- Diagnosis is largely made by history and physical exam

- If experiencing symptoms worse at night, relieved by "shaking off" hand(s), this is known as the "flick sign" and is suggestive of median nerve entrapment

- A physical exam includes tests such as the Phalen sign and Tinel sign which can be highly suggestive of nerve entrapment

- X-ray and ultrasound are two modalities that can aid in the diagnosis

- Electromyography (EMG) is used to help quantify location and amount of nerve damage if present

- The treatment plan is conservative, including adjusting workplace ergonomics, use of braces, and physiotherapy

- Most cases of pregnancy-related carpal tunnel syndrome resolve after delivery

- Steroid injections can be a highly effective first-line treatment option

- Refractory cases may require surgical consideration and release of the transverse carpal ligament
