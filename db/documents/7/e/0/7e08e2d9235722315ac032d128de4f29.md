Nursing staff who work in the ENT area should familiarize themselves with the Schwartze sign so that they can report it to the clinician when they encounter it. This ability to see a potential concern will expedite necessary care, as well as provide an "extra set of eyes" for the condition should it be present, leading to further investigation and prompt therapeutic intervention.
