The typical presentation of nephrolithiasis is a patient in their 40s, possibly already with a history of renal calculi. Patients describe these episodes of pain as sudden, severe, colicky one-sided flank pain that may become constant as time progresses. They may have difficulty laying still and may be seen pacing around the room. The pain may wake up a patient in the middle of the night. Usually, the patient will remember the exact moment when symptoms began. The patient may experience nausea, vomiting, dysuria, gross hematuria, as well as urinary frequency.

The physical exam will often demonstrate a patient in moderate to severe distress, unable to stay still. Patients may be tachycardic, but unless septic, they will be afebrile and normotensive. The patients normally will have a normal abdominal exam. The patient may have costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness on the side of the stone. Otherwise, the physical exam may be normal. Abdominal tenderness should raise concerns in a clinician as it can indicate another serious condition such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, small bowel obstruction (SBO) that may be occurring. Additionally, it is important to be aware of nonclassical symptoms of renal calculi such as low back pain, diarrhea, recurrent urinary tract infection, and isolate microscopic hematuria.
