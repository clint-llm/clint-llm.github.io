The diagnosis of HFI is primarily based on clinical findings and metabolic disturbances observed in individuals after the ingestion of fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol containing food. The fructose tolerance test (FTT), is the standard diagnostic test. It is not routinely recommended due to resulting hypoglycemia and hypophosphatemia in adults, as well as the difficulty in performing the test in infants and children. A non-invasive test for HFI is molecular genetic testing for the ALDOB gene. An invasive test for HFI is a liver biopsy and a check for aldolase B activity.
