Upper blepharoplasty, whether performed for cosmetic reasons or functional reasons, is one of the most frequent operations performed on the face. Eyes and eyelids are the central features of the face that are seen by others and by patients every time they look into a mirror. We also converse by looking from eye-to-eye. This explains the popularity of products designed for use on brows, upper lids, lower lids, and eyelashes.

**Definition**

Upper blepharoplasty constitutes the surgical repair or reconstruction of the upper eyelid including management of upper eyelid skin, orbital septum, any underlying ptosis, and excess or deficient preaponeurotic and medial orbital fat. Blepharoplasty may be performed for cosmetic or reconstructive reasons, often both.

Dermatochalasis refers to laxity or redundancy of eyelid skin and muscle. It is caused by changes due to loss of elastic tissues, thinning of the epidermis, weakening of connective tissue in eyelids, mechanical forces (rubbing), and aging. Genetic influences are also strong.

Steatoblepharon (from the Greek steatos meaning "relating to fat") is the prominence of eyelid fat pads and applies to the upper and lower eyelids. Steatoblepharon may be associated with weakening of the orbital septum and the overlying orbicularis muscle and skin. Dermatochalasis and steatoblepharon are usually noticed in the fourth decade but sometimes earlier.

**Etymology**

The word blepharoplasty is derived from the Greek blepharon which means "eyelid" and plassein which means "to form."
