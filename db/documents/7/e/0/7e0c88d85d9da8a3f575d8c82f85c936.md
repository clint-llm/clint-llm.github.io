Tarantula venom contains a mixture of enzymes and nucleotides that can cause pain, tissue necrosis, and systemic reactions. However, severe sequelae are relatively rare. The more common mechanism of injury is related to cutaneous, pulmonary, and ocular irritation from urticating hairs. As a defense mechanism, tarantulas use their legs to dislodge hairs (or setae) from their abdomen, creating a cloud of urticating hairs. By traveling through the air, they are capable of making contact with the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Cutaneous exposure can cause intense pruritus, local histamine release, and in some cases, systemic reactions. Additionally, hairs can make contact with eyes from those who rub their eyes using their extremities that contain hairs from exposure. Severe injuries occur when hairs are inhaled, causing dyspnea and airway reactions, as well as when hairs make contact with the cornea, where they can become lodged and cause long-term complications.
