**Low-dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test (LDDST)**

In either of the LDDSTs (overnight or two-day), a serum cortisol level of 1.8 mcg/dL (50 nmol/L) is the recommended cut-off value that increases the diagnostic sensitivity of the test to approximately 95%.

**High-dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test (HDDST)**

A reduction in either urinary-free cortisol (UFC) or serum cortisol greater than 50% overnight during a two-day HDDST makes Cushing disease (CD) the likely source of ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome. At a cut-off value of 50% suppression, HDDST provides a sensitivity and specificity of 60 to 100%. Increasing the cut-off value to greater than 90% cortisol suppression increases the specificity of diagnosing Cushing disease to almost 100%, albeit at a much-reduced sensitivity.

**Intravenous Dexamethasone Suppression Test**

The diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is made if the day-2 serum cortisol level is greater than 20% of the baseline value [or greater than 4.7 mcg/dL (130 nmol/L)] with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%.

**Dexamethasone Suppressed Corticotropin-releasing Hormone Test**

Serum cortisol levels greater than 1.4 mcg/dL (39 nmol/L) at 15 minutes suggest Cushing disease with a 90% to 100% sensitivity and 50 to 100% specificity.
