Shallow water blackout is a loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoxia towards the end of a breath-hold dive in shallow water. It is typically caused by hyperventilating just before a dive, which lowers the carbon dioxide (CO2) level and delays the diver's urge to breathe. This activity reviews the role of the healthcare team in the prevention and treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of shallow water blackout risk factors and emergencies.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of patients with shallow water blackout.
- Review the management options available for shallow water blackout.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to prevent and treat shallow water blackout emergencies.
