The patient's history may give a clue to the underlying etiology of this condition. Patients with vernal conjunctivitis or another allergic conjunctivitis may use steroid eye drops for a long time. Patients may be on topical steroid treatment for postsurgical conditions like PRK or may have an implanted depot steroid. Renal transplant patients are another group of likely candidates to develop this condition.

The evaluation of individuals with SID is similar to all forms of OHT and glaucoma. The assessment includes recording visual acuity, thorough anterior and posterior segment examination, measurement of IOP (tonometry), visual field testing, ocular coherence tomography (OCT) testing, and gonioscopy. Tonometry is fundamental in assessing OHT and SID, which ideally should be performed with the standard gold technique of Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT).
