HAT Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is a disease endemic to western sub-Saharan Africa, while HAT Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense affects areas of eastern sub-Saharan Africa. As the 2 diseases are spread by different tsetse subspecies, the 2 diseases do not overlap, though Uganda has both variants within its borders. Estimates of the disease prevalence have proven to be difficult, though some studies estimate 20,000 individuals are affected by the disease, with nearly 9100 dying from both variants in 2010.

African trypanosomiasis can occur at any age and can affect all races.
