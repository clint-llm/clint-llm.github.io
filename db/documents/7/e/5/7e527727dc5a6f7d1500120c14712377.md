A wrist sprain is a common injury, particularly in work and athletic environments. An acute wrist sprain is an injury to a ligament often due to an acute traumatic event or chronic repetitive movements. There are 20 individual ligaments of the wrist connecting the eight carpal bones to each other as well as to the forearm and the hand. Some of these ligaments are more prone to injury than others, with location and dynamic function playing the most critical role in injury susceptibility. For example, two notable soft tissue structures more prone to injury are the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and the scapholunate ligament complex. Most injuries can be diagnosed clinically without requiring advanced imaging or arthroscopy and may receive non-operative treatment. In some cases, advanced imaging and/or surgical interventions may be necessary.
