Causes of peripheral seventh nerve palsy such as Lyme disease and Ramsey Hunt syndrome should be excluded. Other less common causes of facial palsy include tuberculosis, HIV, trauma, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, and neoplasm. There is a reported 10.8% misdiagnosis rate from specialty referral centers. Also, if there are episodes of recurrence, clinicians should consider Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. This is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome with a recurrence of facial palsy, orofacial edema, and a fissured tongue. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is more commonly diagnosed in females.
