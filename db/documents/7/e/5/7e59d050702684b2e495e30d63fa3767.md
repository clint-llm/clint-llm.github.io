The performance of peripheral nerve blocks requires collaboration from all members of the interprofessional medical team. The regionalist and nursing staff should work together to provide the highest level of care and benefit to the patient.

Although a relatively safe procedure, preparation, proper monitoring, and immediate accessibility of emergency equipment and medications should be ready in the event of any adverse events;, if anesthesia is in use in any form, a nurse dedicated to the monitoring of the patient should be on the case. Also, resuscitative equipment should always be in the room, even before starting the procedure. The pharmacist should verify agent selection and dose for the procedure, as well as ensuring no drug-drug interactions by performing medication reconciliation, and reporting to the surgical team any concerns.

Open interprofessional communication and collaboration between the staff is the optimal way to avoid morbidity and improve outcomes when performing femoral nerve block. [Level 5]
