Suprapubic catheterization refers to the placement of a drainage tube into the urinary bladder just above the pubic symphysis.Â This is typically performed for individuals who are unable to drain their bladder via the urethra. Suprapubic catheterization offers an alternative means to drain the urinary bladder when other methods are not clinically feasible, undesirable or impossible. Suprapubic tubes are easier to change, can be of almost any size and are generally considered more comfortable for male patients with long term catheter requirements. Alternatives to suprapubic catheterization include urethral catheterization, intermittent catheterization, urinary diversion and percutaneous nephrostomy drainage. These specialized drainage catheters are typically placed either percutaneously or openly. Percutaneous access commonly employs visualization using cystoscopy.
