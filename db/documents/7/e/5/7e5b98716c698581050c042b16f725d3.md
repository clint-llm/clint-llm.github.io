Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disease associated with abnormally high cholestanol levels in the blood, accumulating in the nervous system and other organ systems. The cholestanol accumulates most notably in the brain, tendons, eyes, arteries and accounts for a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and explains the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
- Outline the evaluation of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
- Review the management for patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
