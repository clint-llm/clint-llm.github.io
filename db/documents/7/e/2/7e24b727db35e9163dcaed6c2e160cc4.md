Obesity treatment is delivered in various settings. It usually starts from self-management based on information available on print and digital media. This information may not be 100% validated scientifically and may not be accurate. Clinical settings for delivery of obesity treatment start from primary care to specialized settings, including weight loss clinics and endocrinology practices. Digital health care delivery and monitoring treatment outcomes for obesity treatment should be integrated into the conventional healthcare delivery model. After the COVID-19 epidemic, digital healthcare delivery is becoming more common. An integrated model for obesity treatment in general and dietary intervention, in particular, should include self-monitoring based on mobile apps with the availability of feedback from a dietitian, nurse educator, clinician, or health coach. Digital health care delivery can also be used to provide counseling for behavioral modification in obesity treatment.

A recent randomized control trial involving application-based (app-based, cellular phone application) self-monitoring and provider counseling for obesity treatment in primary care settings demonstrated that participants were more likely to lose more than 5% of their baseline weight with app-based self-monitoring along with counseling from providers.
