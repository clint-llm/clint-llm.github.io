An interprofessional team consisting of a surgeon and a nurse will provide the best care for patients undergoing rotational flap transfer; a dermatologist and/or a surgical oncologist may also be involved in treating the lesion that initially led to the creation of the cutaneous defect that required rotational flap reconstruction. Clinicians, such as the surgeon and nurses experienced in wound management and postoperative care of local flaps, should follow the patient closely to identify early complications like infection, hematoma, and venous congestion and promptly manage these problems to mitigate long-term sequelae, exercising open communication if any concerns arise.
