Esmolol is an ultra-fast-acting medication that can quickly alter heart rate and pressure. While the patient is on esmolol, it is recommended that they have continuous blood pressure monitoring, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and, if possible, EKG.

The peripheral intravenous (IV) site should be checked regularly for any signs or symptoms of infiltration and extravasation.

As mentioned above, in patients with comorbidities, appropriate blood levels should be monitored, such as glucose (diabetes), thyroid levels (hyperthyroid), potassium (renal insufficiency), and peripheral pulses (peripheral vascular disease).

The CHA2DS2-VASc score should be measured for risk stratification of a thromboembolic event and decision regarding anticoagulation according to AHA/ACC guidelines.
