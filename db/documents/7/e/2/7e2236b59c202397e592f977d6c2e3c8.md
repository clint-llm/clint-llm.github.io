Cutaneous LP typically clears spontaneously within 1 to 2 years, so treatment is aimed at reducing pruritus and time to resolution. For limited LP, first-line treatment is superpotent topical steroids (clobetasol 0.05%) twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks. Inadequate response to topical steroids may be augmented with intralesional steroid injections (triamcinolone 5 to 10 mg/mL). For diffuse LP, first-line treatment is daily oral corticosteroids (prednisone 30 to 60 mg) tapered over 2 to 6 weeks. If no change is seen, second-line therapy should be considered. Second-line therapy may include metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 3 to 8 weeks), sulfasalazine (500 mg twice daily increased in 500 mg increments every 3 days until 2.5 grams daily is reached, for 3 to 6 weeks), isotretinoin (10 mg twice daily for 2 months), acitretin (30 mg daily for 8 weeks), PUVA, UVB, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or methotrexate (15 mg per week for adults, 0.25 mg/kg per week for children). Third line treatment may include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, griseofulvin, terbinafine, antimalarials, tetracyclines, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, etanercept, adalimumab, or low-molecular-weight heparin.

Oral LP may spontaneously resolve within 5 years, but many cases are chronic and never resolve. Treatment-induced remission is typically followed by relapse. Thus, asymptomatic oral LP should not be treated as the side-effect burden of treatment is high. The goal for treatment of symptomatic oral LP is to heal erosive lesions to reduce pain and allow normal food intake. Patients should be instructed to avoid spicy or acidic foods as well as alcohol and tobacco as these exacerbate symptoms. First-line treatment is very high potency topical steroids three times daily until remission. No improvement after 6 weeks should prompt escalation of therapy. Second-line treatment is oral corticosteroids or application of topical calcineurin inhibitors. Third-line treatment may include cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate.

Consideration of drug-induced LP must always be explored prior to starting therapy. Withdrawal of the suspected drug leading to the gradual disappearance of lesions confirms the diagnosis, although it may take some time for lesions to fully resolve.
