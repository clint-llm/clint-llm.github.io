Sitting or standing in a comfortable position with proper posture and supporting the incentive spirometer in the correct, upright position, the patient is encouraged to take slow, deliberate inhales through the mouthpiece. The patient is encouraged to achieve a certain volume which can vary based on the patient's height and age. The patient receives visible feedback from the piston rising to the preset marker that the clinician has set. The patient is instructed to hold his breath for at least 2 or 3 seconds at a minimum at full inspiration. Expiration is performed slowly and calmly with lips no longer sealed around the mouthpiece. After a series of 10 inhalations, coughing should be prompted to further clear the lungs of phlegm. It is advised to repeat incentive spirometer use for at least ten deep breaths every hour while awake.

The breathing pattern when using an incentive spirometer is significant and should be communicated to the patient. The patient should be shown how to expand the lower chest at maximal inspiration rather than use the accessory muscles of inhalation. The patient should focus on expanding the lower ribcage instead of expanding only the upper chest.
