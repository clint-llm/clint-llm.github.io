SCH is an umbrella term comprising multiple entities. In a patient presenting with acute right upper quadrant pain and jaundice, one must differentiate between an acute sickle cell hepatic crisis, acute hepatic sequestration, acute intrahepatic cholestasis, acute viral hepatitis, acute cholecystitis, and choledocholithiasis. One must also keep in mind that acute hepatitis secondary to drugs or toxin use can precipitate a similar presentation.

Under SCH, one must consider chronic viral hepatitis, transfusion overload, and sickle cell cholangiopathy in a more chronic hepatopathy that can present with persistently elevated transaminases. Moreover, one must also rule out hereditary hemochromatosis and other liver conditions such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Other etiology, including infections such as bacterial or fungal, should also be considered.
