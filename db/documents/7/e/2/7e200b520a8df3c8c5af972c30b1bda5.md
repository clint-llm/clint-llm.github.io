The diagnosis of hirsutism requires the careful collection of medical history data, physical examination, appropriate biological, and radiological investigations. Hirsutism can be idiopathic, which is a diagnosis of elimination or secondary to hyperandrogenism that also encompasses other serious health problems, including diabetes, metabolic syndromes, and infertility. In some cases, a tumor process is involved.

The management of hirsutism is interprofessional, including the dermatologist, the endocrinologist, and the gynecologist. The treatments used serve to reduce the severity of hirsutism, as well as to improve overall health and self-esteem.****
