A biloma is defined as an abnormal, well-circumscribed, extra-biliary collection of bile. Most bilomas present secondary to iatrogenic or traumatic disruption of the biliary tree. While uncommon, bilomas are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially when infected or impinging on surrounding structures. Bilomas may present with varied and subtle symptoms and signs, and therefore physicians must recognize their etiology and presentation to allow prompt diagnosis. This article will review the etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and role of the interprofessional team in managing bilomas.

- Describe the etiology of hepatic bilomas.
- Outline the typical presentation of hepatic bilomas.
