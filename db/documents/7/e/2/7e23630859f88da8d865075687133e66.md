In the treatment of erectile dysfunction, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) works by increasing cAMP production, reducing the influx of calcium within the penile vascular smooth muscle. The result is a relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle by arterial dilation. Blood becomes entrapped in the penis, which eventually leads to an erection.

PGE1 can also serve as a treatment for maintaining the patency of ductus arteriosus heart defects in neonates by a similar mechanism. PGE1 dilates the ductus smooth muscle so that it remains open and blood flow may be maintained. Ductal patency allows for oxygenated blood flow until the congenital anomaly can be surgically corrected.
