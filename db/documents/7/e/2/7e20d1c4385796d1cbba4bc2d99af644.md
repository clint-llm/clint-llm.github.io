- Nasofrontal duct and or nasolacrimal duct disruption due to direct damage, displaced fracture segments, or iatrogenic injury.

- Facial deformity, because perfect correction of telecanthus or nasal depression can be difficult to achieve, and some patients will retain a degree of asymmetry. Depending on the surgical approach, patients may experience temporary or permanent paralysis and or anesthesia of the forehead. Scars of the forehead may remain prominent in the long-term as well, particularly if tissue avulsion, infection, or involvement of the sebaceous glabellar skin occurs.

- Infection of the incision site, soft tissues, and meninges.

- Mucocele formation is a complication of sinus or lacrimal drainage disruption, and these can become infected, evolving into mucopyoceles.

- Mental health issues, as patients with facial injuries, are at greater risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety-related disorders, particularly those who were victims of assault.
