Recurrent MR is the most common complication following primary MVr. Intraoperative assessment via TEE of the repaired valve is crucial, as it can aid in immediate assessment of the valve. If there is persistent mild or greater MR, the valve must be re-explored and either re-repaired or replaced. This decision is critical in cases of impaired LV function, as these patients may not tolerated a long repeat ischemic/arrest period. MVr long term durability is more difficult to predict. Flameng et al.

Following successful repair, patients with PHT/AF have worse long-term survival and event-free survival, as well as increased compromise of MV repair.

SAM of the mitral valve can result if there is a discrepancy between the annular area and leaflet tissue following repair. SAM is the result of anterior MVP into the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) during systole. It most commonly occurs with an undersized annuloplasty ring or excess leaflet tissue.
