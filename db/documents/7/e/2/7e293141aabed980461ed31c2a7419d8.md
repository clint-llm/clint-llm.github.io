Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that exerts its effects by binding human TNF-α soluble and transmembrane structures and blocking its binding with the TNF-α receptors. The prevention further hinders the biological activity of TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine protein that plays a role in inflammation, autoimmunity, and malignancy.
