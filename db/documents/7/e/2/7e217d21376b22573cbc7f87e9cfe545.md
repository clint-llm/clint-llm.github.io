The management of blast injuries is with an interprofessional team that includes a trauma surgeon, general surgeon, ENT specialist, ophthalmologist, plastic surgeon, anesthesiologist, intensivist and the emergency department physician.Â Treatment and managements are dictated by the injuries found on the history and physical examination. Carefully review and evaluation for blast injuries that can be delayed in presentation need to be specifically evaluated for if indicated. If the injury is minor the patient may be observed and discharged. However, all major blast injuries need to be admitted and monitored. The outcomes depend on the severity of the injury. Many patients with severe injuries do die at the scene and only those with moderate to minior injuries are seen in the emergency department. For those who survive, there is a prolonged rehabilitation phase. A mental health consult is recommended as many do suffer from PTSD.
