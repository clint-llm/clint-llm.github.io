MBD pathophysiology is unclear. However, there are some explanations for it:

- Ethanol is an important risk factor for various brain disorders, depending on the amount and frequency of its use. Alcohol-associated hypovitaminosis, mainly B1 (due to gastrointestinal direct effect, liver damage-induced metabolic disturbance, reduced re-absorption by renal tubular cells, increased skeletal and visceral protein catabolism, abnormal lipid metabolism, or dietary deficiency) and oxidative stress may directly damage the corpus callosum producing an initial phase of cytotoxic edema and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and a later phase of focal demyelination and necrosis, consequently resulting in atrophy

- Alcohol alters neurotransmitter activity, disables neuronal plasticity, interferes with lipid metabolism, and influences the expression of proteins responsible for attaching cytoskeletal elements in the white matter

- B1 vitamin (thiamine) deficiency produces neurological impairment by affecting the carbohydrate metabolism process, reducing the available ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which later induces the inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase activity, therefore increasing the activation of catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which in turn can result in delirium, hallucinations, and delusions

- Damage of the corpus callosum can be explained because of high myelin content, being the major white matter commissure that connects both of the hemispheres and facilitates the exchange of cognitive, sensory, and motor information
