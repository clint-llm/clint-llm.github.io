Hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine. Hematuria can be gross or microscopic. Gross hematuria is visible blood in the urine. Microscopic hematuria refers to the detection of blood on urinalysis or urine microscopy. Hematuria can be intermittent or persistent. Hematuria is defined as the presence of at least 5 red blood cells/HPF in 3 of 3 consecutive centrifuged specimens obtained at least 7 days apart. Hematuria may be asymptomatic or symptomatic and may be associated with other urinary tract abnormalities. Hematuria is often first encountered by the primary care provider.
