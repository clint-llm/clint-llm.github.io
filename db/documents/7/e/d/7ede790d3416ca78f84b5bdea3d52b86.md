The normal pericardium sac contains anywhere from 20-50 ml of plasma. A sudden increase in the pericardial fluid can increase pressure on the right atria and right ventricles, which can compromise right atrial filling, reduce stroke volume, and diminish cardiac output. It is not the volume of pericardial fluid that is important but the speed of accumulation. With gradual accumulation of fluid, the pericardium has time to stretch and accommodate the increase in fluid.

Pericardial effusion may impede diastolic filling of the right heart if it accumulates too quickly, and it may also result in constriction of the heart if the accumulation is persistent.

Inflammation of the pericardium produces a serous or purulent discharge. For example, in viral pericarditis, the fluid is serous. Purulent discharge can present in neoplastic or tuberculous associated episodes of pericarditis.
