The majority of simple cysts aspirated disappear after aspiration, and the treatment is considered complete.Â Follow-up exams and imaging vary based on the cyst and findings from aspiration or biopsy. For a simple cyst, repeat imaging should be done 4 to 6 weeks after aspiration. Rapidly reformed cysts following repeat imaging are suggestive of malignancy. However, due to the very low prevalence of malignancy in simple cysts, it has been suggested that the routine follow up imaging 4-6 weeks after aspiration can be safely abandoned with patients unless there are new symptoms or recurrent lumps.

Complex cysts are typically followed more closely. If the histopathology results appear benign after initial aspiration or biopsy, then follow-up imaging should be planned every 6 to 12 months for 2 years. If, after 2 years, there have been no changes to the cyst, then repeat imaging can be stopped. If there are any concerning changes, then repeat biopsy or surgical excision is indicated.

Most cystic breast lesions are benign and, therefore, do not require any oncological treatment. The rare malignant cystic lesions are treated as breast cancer would be treated. The treatment is a combination of surgical resection and adjuvant treatment. The adjuvant treatment includes hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and the use of biological agents.
