Cromolyn sodium is indicated as an adjunctive treatment for a variety of medical conditions and is available as an oral solution, ophthalmic solution, inhalation solution, and nasal spray. Although adverse effects and hypersensitivity reactions to the drug are rare, it is the responsibility of the interprofessional healthcare team, including nurses, pharmacists, and clinicians, to recognize the clinical presentation and provide the appropriate management of potentially life-threatening sequelae if they occur.

In the event a patient has a severe hypersensitivity reaction to cromolyn sodium, the emergency department clinician and nurses must execute an effective, patient-centered treatment plan which includes:

- Withdrawing the offending agent by stopping cromolyn sodium use

- Continual monitoring of the patient for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and cardiac arrhythmias

- Starting a peripheral IV and administering fluids

- Administering epinephrine, oxygen, antihistamines, and corticosteroids

- Consulting the pharmacist for thorough medication record review

- Consulting an intensivist for further observation and monitoring in the hospital

Following a hypersensitivity reaction or severe adverse event, a thorough discussion of future drug therapy changes must occur with the health care provider. Through an interprofessional approach, cromolyn sodium can be safely and effectively used in the management of patient care.
