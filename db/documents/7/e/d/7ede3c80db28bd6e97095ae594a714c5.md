Jarisch Herxheimer reaction (JHR) is a transient clinical phenomenon that occurs in patients infected by spirochetes who undergo antibiotic treatment. The reaction occurs within 24 hours of antibiotic treatment of spirochete infections, including syphilis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and relapsing fever. JHR usually manifests as fever, chills, rigors, nausea and vomiting, headache, tachycardia, hypotension, hyperventilation, flushing, myalgia, and exacerbation of skin lesions. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of JHR and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Jarisch Herxheimer reaction.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Jarisch Herxheimer reaction.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a Jarisch Herxheimer reaction.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients presenting with Jarisch Herxheimer reaction.
