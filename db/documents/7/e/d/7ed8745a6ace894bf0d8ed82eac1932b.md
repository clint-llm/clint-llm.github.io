The true prevalence of hereditary elliptocytosis is not known as many mildly affected people remain undiagnosed. An estimated prevalence has been found to be 1 in 2000 to 1 in 4000 throughout the globe. HE most commonly occurs in African, Southeast Asian, or Mediterranean people. In West Africa, it's prevalence is as high as 1%-2%. Its geographical distribution reflects malaria-endemic areas, and malaria may have driven the expansion of the gene mutation.

Certain variants of HE like Southeast Asian ovalocytosis are very common in people from Malaysia,Â Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and the Philippines, where the prevalence is as high as 5% to 25%. Spherocytic elliptocytosis is common in individuals of European descent.
