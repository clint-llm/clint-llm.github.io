Cafe-au-lait macules are benign lesions without any clinical significance, which are common in the general population. Multiple CALMs may be the hallmark for a genetic disorder that needs to be evaluated by anÂ interprofessional team approach. A team consisting of a pediatric neurologist, dermatologist, ophthalmologist, geneticist, orthopedic surgeon, and a specialized nurse should be involved in the care of a patient with a suspected genetic disorder. Annual follow up is required to monitor the progression of the disease.
