Osteoma cutis or cutaneous ossification is a rare and benign dermatological disease characterized by bone formation in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. It can be either primary when it occurs de novo without a pre-existing disease or secondary when it develops in association with an underlying condition such as trauma, neoplastic or inflammatory diseases.
