# Continuing Education Activity

Pneumothorax is gas in the pleural space. This condition can present in one of three ways: spontaneous (primary), secondary, and traumatic. This activity focuses on a subset of traumatic pneumothoraces known as iatrogenic pneumothorax This refers to a pneumothorax that has developed secondary to an invasive procedure such as pulmonary needle biopsy (transthoracic and transbronchial), placement of a central venous line or positive pressure ventilation. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of pneumothorax and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pneumothorax.
- Review the presentation of a patient with a pneumothorax.
- Summarize the treatment options for pneumothorax.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by pneumothorax.

# Introduction

Pneumothorax is gas in the pleural space. This condition can present in one of three ways: spontaneous (primary), secondary, and traumatic. This activity focuses on a subset of traumatic pneumothoraces known as iatrogenic pneumothorax  This refers to a pneumothorax that has developed secondary to an invasive procedure such as pulmonary needle biopsy (transthoracic and transbronchial), placement of a central venous line or positive pressure ventilation.

# Etiology

An iatrogenic pneumothorax is a known complication of invasive procedures such as pulmonary needle biopsy (transthoracic and transbronchial), placement of a central venous line, or positive pressure ventilation.

# Epidemiology

The incidence of an iatrogenic pneumothorax is directly proportional to the number of invasive procedures performed.

# Pathophysiology

Any intervention in proximity to the abdomen, especially the thorax, can cause an iatrogenic pneumothorax. This is especially true when placing a subclavian central venous catheter without the use of ultrasound (i.e., "blindly") using landmarks.   In landmark-based subclavian central venous catheter placement, per Kilbourne et al.,

# History and Physical

The presentation in a patient with a pneumothorax can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening based on the size, rate of development, and the health of the underlying lung. An iatrogenic pneumothorax is part of a differential diagnosis in a patient with pleuritic pain and dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side is highly suspicious. Any pneumothorax can become a tension pneumothorax. Findings could include hypoxia, hypotension, distended neck veins, a displaced trachea, and unilaterally decreased breath sounds.

# Evaluation

Iatrogenic pneumothorax can be diagnosed clinically. Point-of-care ultrasound has the advantage of being rapid, highly sensitive and specific, and easily repeatable. Suggestive findings include the lack of pleural sliding. A "point sign" (sliding pleural next to non-sliding pleura) is diagnostic. An upright posteroanterior chest radiography has 83% sensitivity.

# Treatment / Management

First, determine if the patient is stable or unstable. Next, provide supplemental oxygen at a rate to maintain adequate oxygenation.

# Differential Diagnosis

Although the diagnosis of pneumothorax should be definite and precise, a patient presenting with pleuritic pain without further management should elicit a robust differential diagnosis

- Myocardial infarct

- Myocardial ischemia

- Pulmonary embolus

- Pericarditis

- Pleurisy

- Pneumonia

# Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials

Given that iatrogenic pneumothorax is a patient safety indicator (PSI) that is directly related to invasive procedures, most of the pertinent studies and ongoing trials focus on quality improvement and incidence reduction. Central venous catheter insertion is the main cause of iatrogenic pneumothoraces; so, patient factors (underlying condition, anatomy, restlessness, previous procedures), procedure decision-making (site, catheter type), and clinical factors are given particular consideration for improvement of outcomes.

# Prognosis

The estimated risk of pneumothorax recurrence is 23% to 50% over a 1- to 5-year follow-up period, with the highest risk during the first month.

# Complications

Tension pneumothorax is the most notable complication of any pneumothorax previously described. This disorder is life-threatening and requires immediate intervention.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

A pneumothorax, also known as a collapsed lung, occurs when air (either from the lung or outside) collects in the space between the lung and the chest wall. The focus of this article is the specific cause of a collapsed lung, called iatrogenic or caused accidentally during surgery or a procedure. Symptoms of a collapsed are a sharp or stabbing chest pain and/or trouble breathing. People with small amounts of air may not have any symptoms at all. This condition can be an emergency and require immediate treatment. Treatment involves extracting the air trapped between the lung and the chest wall by either a needle, scalpel and finger, or chest tube. Regardless, a chest tube is inserted and stays in place until the lung expands to its normal size. Some individuals with severe cases may require surgery. After being treated for a collapsed lung with a tube, chances of having a recurrence is low but possible. Patients should avoid scuba diving and flying in a plane for at least 72 hours.

# Pearls and Other Issues

- Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a patient safety indicator (PSI) condition.  It is a traumatic pneumothorax secondary to an invasive procedure or surgery.

- The most common cause is the placement of a subclavian central venous line (CVL).

- Other causes include pulmonary needle biopsy (transthoracic and transbronchial), nasogastric tube placement, or positive pressure ventilation. There are case reports after placing nebulizer kits and acupuncture to the chest wall.

- The presentation is mainly pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea with decreased to absent breath sounds on the affected side during or after a procedure.

- Treatment should not be delayed for imaging.

- The diagnosis is ideally made clinically. Ultrasound evaluation to check for pneumothorax is emerging as a very accurate and rapid tool.

- Treatment is needle decompression followed by tube thoracostomy. VATS and open thoracotomy are reserved for recurrent or severe cases.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Iatrogenic pneumothorax is an important PSI condition associated with morbidity and mortality. Iatrogenic pneumothoraces are attributed to procedure techniques/decision-making pitfalls, medical provider experience, and not using ultrasound during CVC placement.
