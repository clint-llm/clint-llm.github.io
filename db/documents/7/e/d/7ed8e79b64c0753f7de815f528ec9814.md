Entamoeba coli is one of many non-pathogenic protozoa found in humans. It is transmitted through fecal-oral contact, and the mature cyst can be found in contaminated water. Typically, these protozoa inhabit the large intestinal tract and can be identified in diagnostic stool specimens. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of Entamoeba coli.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Entamoeba coli infection.
- Explain the evaluation of Entamoeba coli infection.
- Review the management options available for Entamoeba coli.
