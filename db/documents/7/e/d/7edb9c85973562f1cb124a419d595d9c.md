The etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD) is still not known and may be related to a wind-borne or water-borne pathogen.  However, in recent years there have been studies that have shown certain genetic markers (such as HLA-B51 and HLA-Bw22j2 serotypes, chemokine receptor gene-cluster CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes and FCGR3A polymorphism of the IgG receptor IIIa) show a predisposition to the disease.  In fact, siblings are 10-20 times more likely to develop the disease when compared to the general population.
