The sleep cycle is regulated by the circadian rhythm, which is driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. GABAergic sleep-promoting nuclei are found in the brainstem, lateral hypothalamus, and preoptic area.

Transitions between sleep and wake states are orchestrated by multiple brain structures, which include:

**Hypothalamus:**controls onset of sleep

**Hippocampus**: memory region active during dreaming

**Amygdala**: emotion center active during dreaming

**Thalamus**: prevents sensory signals from reaching the cortex

**Reticular formation:**regulates the transition between sleep and wakefulness

**Pons**: helps initiate REM sleep. The extraocular movements that occur during REM are due to the activity of PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation/conjugate gaze center).
