Parotitis can be infectious or due to a variety of inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the causes of parotitis are numerous, and the description is as follows:

Acute bacterial parotitis is uncommon, but it especially concerns the extremes of age. In the elderly population, it is a significant risk, particularly after abdominal surgery, and can be fatal if it occurs in neonates.

Chronic bacterial parotitis may be associated with calculi or stenosis of the ducts due to injury. The more common factor is decreased salivary flow, which could be secondary to inflammation.

Mumps is spread by either droplets or directly through oropharyngeal secretions containing the paramyxovirus.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may also cause parotitis with generalized lymphadenopathy and localized enlargement of parotid glands.

Tuberculosis infrequently leads to parotitis and is not an important cause, except that around 25% of patients are found to have pulmonary tuberculosis that could infect their associates. Today, most cases are because of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Patients present with enlarged, non-tender, and moderately painful glands.

Influenza has also been reported to have caused parotitis. During the 2014 to 2015 US influenza season, 256 cases of influenza-related parotitis were observed in 27 states. Parotitis mainly occurred in patients under the age of 20 years and tended to be painful and unilateral.

Chronic punctate parotitis is another rather less understood condition. Several terms have been used to describe the condition, such as Sjögren syndrome, Mikulicz disease, chronic punctate sialectasis, benign lymphoepithelial lesion of Godwin, and recurrent parotitis of childhood. This group demonstrates punctate sialectasis implying points like dilatations within the gland.

Cystic fibrosis, dehydration, malnutrition, abdominal surgery, immunosuppression, and dental infections increase the risk of acute bacterial parotitis. The most common cause is Staph aureus; other bacterial causes may include Strep viridans, E. coli, and anaerobic oral flora. Consider group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection in neonates. Melioidosis from Pseudomonas pseudomallei from contaminated water can be common in Southeast Asia.

Of the many viral infections resulting in parotitis, mumps (a paramyxovirus) is the classic cause of epidemic parotitis.

Inflammatory conditions resulting in parotitis include sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Uncommon causes of parotitis can include trauma, surgery (such as manipulation during carotid endarterectomy), drug exposure (such as iodides, heavy metals, phenylbutazone, and thiouracil), and radiation therapy, especially whole brain radiation therapy can lead to parotitis.

Chronic nonspecific parotitis and recurrent parotitis of childhood (juvenile recurrent parotitis) have no definite infectious cause. However, antibiotics are frequently used to treat the latter but may occur due to scar tissue, stricture, and sialectasis.
