To test for the Babinski sign, the instrument is run up the lateral plantar side of the foot from the heel to the toes and across the metatarsal pads to the base of the big toe.

Many variations of the Babinski sign have been described. Each of them is designed to elicit dorsiflexion of the big toe. The more common include Chaddock (stimulating under lateral malleolus), Gordon (squeezing calf), Oppenheim (applying pressure to the medial side of the tibia), and Throckmorton (hitting the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe). The mechanism by which these alternatives elicit this response is likely similar to the Babinski response. These variations are useful in patients who have a significant withdrawal response to the conventional testing for the Babinski reflex.
