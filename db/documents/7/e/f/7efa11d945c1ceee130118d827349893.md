If Kohler disease is suspected, patients should be referred to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation.

The treatment of Kohler disease is conservative. NSAIDs can be used to decrease symptoms but have not been shown to shorten the duration of disease symptoms. Immobilization via a short leg walking cast for 4 to 6 weeks can be used in patients to shorten the duration of symptoms. The effect of weight-bearing casts compared to non-weight bearing casts is unclear and often surgeon dependent. Some reports of using offloading orthotics for symptomatic relief has been reported; however, it does not appear orthotics shorten the duration of symptoms.

There is no indication for surgery in Kohler disease. If symptoms do not improve, physicians should consider an alternative diagnosis. Both symptoms and radiographs should start to show improvement in around six months.
