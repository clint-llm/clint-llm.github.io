According to SAMHSA’s (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 1.5 million (0.6%) people used cocaine or crack. People aged 18 to 25 were more than twice as likely to use cocaine compared with other adults, with men being twice as likely as women to use cocaine.  Methamphetamine, another stimulant often abused, has resulted in nationwide hospital emergency department visits related to the use of methamphetamine, mephedrone, and MDMA.

These drugs know no socioeconomic boundary and are seen in all aspects of life, from the poor to the wealthy. They are easy to obtain and, in some cases, relatively easy to the manufacturer.
