There are no absolute contraindications to the administration of norepinephrine.

Norepinephrine use may be contraindicated to treat hypotension, likely secondary to cardiogenic mechanisms. Additionally, norepinephrine is probably not the best agent for hypotension, primarily related to hypovolemia. However, the FDA states that its use could be considered in low volume states, but only as an emergency measure for maintaining coronary or cerebral perfusion pressure while waiting for appropriateÂ volume resuscitation.

Generally, norepinephrine should be avoided in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis as the subsequent vasoconstriction will increase the area of ischemia and infarction.

Profound hypoxia or hypercarbia can sensitize the myocardium to unstable arrhythmias, which could be exacerbated or even initiated by norepinephrine - this is also the case with specific anesthetic agents, such as halothane and cyclopropane.

The preparation of norepinephrine, typically utilized in critical care settings, contains sodium metabisulfite, which may cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. According to manufacturer labeling, this effect may be more common in asthmatics.

Care is necessary when using norepinephrine concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or amitriptyline and imipramine-type antidepressants. Combining any of these drugs can lead to severe and prolonged hypertension.
