The blood vessels in the brainstem are closely associated with the structures they supply. The blood supply in the medulla can divide into two categories rostral medullary blood supply and the caudal medullary blood supply. The rostral medullary blood supply consists of the vertebral artery, basilar artery, and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The caudal medullary blood supply consists of the anterior spinal artery and the posterior spinal artery (PSA). The arteries of the medulla that are responsible for supplying the nucleus of the solitary tract and, therefore, the nucleus gustatory are the PICA rostrally and the PSA caudally.
