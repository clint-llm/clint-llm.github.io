Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic neoplasms of the pancreas that grow within the pancreatic ducts and produce mucin. They have the potential to become malignant, so it is important to diagnose and manage them early and appropriately. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.
- Identify the types of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. 
- Summarize the diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to optimize outcomes for patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.
