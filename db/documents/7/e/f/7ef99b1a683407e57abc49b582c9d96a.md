**VEGF, Angiogenesis, and Eye Diseases**

VEGF is a crucial factor for initiating and promoting the abnormal growth of new retinal blood vessels (neovascularization) as occurs in diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of vision loss in people 65 and older. The macula is a small region near the center of the retina and is responsible for detailed vision. A lack of oxygen supply to the retina can cause the secretion of VEGF, which then promotes the growth of new retinal blood capillaries (angiogenesis). Drugs that block VEGF can be effective at stopping some forms of macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. One such drug, ranibizumab, can be injected directly into the retina. The “mab” in “ranibizumab” indicates that the drug is from a monoclonal antibody.
