The history of a fall is crucial to the diagnostic process. Both pre and post-fall symptoms should be considered in detail. It is essential to be able to diagnose any other condition that may present with a fall.

Syncope: If an unwitnessed fall is not accidental, or due to a “slip or trip,” then the patient most likely experienced a syncopal event and had a loss of consciousness. Under these circumstances, an evaluation of unexplained syncope must be pursued.

Other conditions that may present with a fall include:

- Transient ischemic attack (TIA)

- Stroke

- Seizure

- Acute coronary syndrome

- Orthostatic hypotension

- Arrhythmia

- Pulmonary embolism

- Endocrine disorders

- Metabolic derangements

- Infection/Sepsis

In the elderly, age-associated memory impairments may obscure recall, and history of prodromal symptoms or whether or not loss of consciousness occurred can be difficult to ascertain. In the absence of a witness, the differential diagnosis between falls, syncope, TIA, and epilepsy can be difficult. Utilizing the combination of history and physical exam findings can help narrow the differential diagnosis.
