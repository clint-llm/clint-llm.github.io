There are no specific contraindications to prescribing ixazomib; however, many warnings and precautions are necessary for patients taking this drug. For example, ixazomib should not be prescribed alongside cytochrome P3A inducers. Also, female patients should not take ixazomib during pregnancy due to the possibility of harming the fetus.

Patients should avoid pregnancy while taking ixazomib, and contraception should be used while using the drug, as well as for the ninety days following the final dose of ixazomib. This measure applies to both males and females. Furthermore, due to the unknown effects of ixazomib on breast milk, the drug should be avoided in breastfeeding women. More caution is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment as higher levels of ixazomib are circulating in the blood; therefore, clinicians should reduce the dose of ixazomib is usually decreased, as was mentioned earlier. In the geriatric population, ixazomib can be dosed normally as research has shown no differences between varying age populations. On the other hand, the safety and use of ixazomib in pediatric populations are unknown.
