The prognosis depends on the etiology. In HT1, where treatment is started early, the prognosis tends to be better. One study in which five HT1 patients were started on nitisinone and dietary restriction within 28 days of life resulted in no death or liver failure during 15 years of follow-up.

Untreated patients may succumb to acute liver failure before two years of life or from chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma during the second decade of life. HT2 and HT3 are rare diseases, and long-term survival data are unknown. However, both of these diseases usually have a milder course than HT1. Furthermore, the outcome is significantly improved by early diagnosis and treatment. The introduction of the NBS program in many developed countries has been instrumental in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders.
