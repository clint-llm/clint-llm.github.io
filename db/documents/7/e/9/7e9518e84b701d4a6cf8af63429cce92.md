Post-void residual volume (PVR) is the amount of urine retained in the bladder after a voluntary void and functions as a diagnostic tool. A PVR can be used to evaluate many disease processes, including but not limited to neurogenic bladder, cauda equina syndrome, urinary outlet obstruction, mechanical obstruction, medication-induced urinary retention, postoperative urinary retention, and urinary tract infections.

The PVR may be determined via urinary catheterization, a portable dedicated bladder scanner, or a formal ultrasound examination.

When used in conjunction with the American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom score and a 24-hour voiding diary, the PVR can provide the clinician with a clear picture of the patient's bladder activity, functionality, and correlation with symptoms leading to an evidence-based diagnosis which then guides appropriate directed therapy.
