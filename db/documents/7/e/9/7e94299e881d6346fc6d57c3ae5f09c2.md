The following tests may be useful in assessing patients with serotonin syndrome and narrowing the differential diagnosis: complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine and BUN, creatine phosphokinase, hepatic transaminases, coagulation studies, urinalysis, drug screen, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture. No laboratory test confirms the diagnosis, but patients may have leukocytosis, elevated creatine phosphokinase, and decreased serum bicarbonate concentration. Patients may develop labile blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac dysrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, myoglobinuria, and respiratory failure.
