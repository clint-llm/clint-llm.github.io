Patients should be educated about the importance of maintaining their flexibility in the gastrocnemius muscle. Regular gentle stretching activities for the lower extremities may help lower the risk of gastrocnemius strains and reinjury. Patients should also be encouraged to follow up with their physical therapist as recommended and continue with their prescribed home exercise program during their rehabilitation. Athletes should be educated that return to play should not occur before they are pain-free and have recovered their full range of motion.
