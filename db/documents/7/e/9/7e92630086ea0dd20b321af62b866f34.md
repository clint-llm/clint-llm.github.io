The prognosis of chronic angle-closure glaucoma is variable and likely depends on many factors such as the stage of disease at detection. A prophylactic peripheral iridotomy does not guarantee the prevention of angle-closure glaucoma as over 50% of the fellow eyes may still develop chronic angle-closure glaucoma over time despite receiving a peripheral iridotomy at the time of an attack of angle-closure in the contralateral eye.

More extensive peripheral anterior synechiae and narrower width of the drainage angle are associated with higher intraocular pressure and a larger vertical cup-to-disc ratio.
