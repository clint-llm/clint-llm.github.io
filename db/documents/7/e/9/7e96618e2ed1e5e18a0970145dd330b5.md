Although encountered in clinical practice for the past 4 to 5 decades, hypertension in the neonates has been relatively recently recognized and investigated as distinct neonatal morbidity. The evaluation and management of the disease process were earlier compromised by a lack of comprehensive normative data for neonatal blood pressure (BP) due to the unavailability of accurate invasive or non-invasive techniques for its measurement. The significant and rapid variability in the BP with gestational age, postnatal age, birth weight, and gender in the referred population posed further challenges in establishing normal values and an inclusive definition of neonatal hypertension (NH).

The clinical course, outcomes, and long-term sequelae of NH are still incompletely understood, and there is a lack of consensus among the experts about the use and selection of antihypertensive drugs for its treatment.

NH is diagnosed when the systolic or diastolic BP (DBP) values, as measured on 3 separate occasions, are over or equal to the 95th percentile for the infant's post-conceptual age.

**Measurement Of Blood Pressure**

BP can be measured via invasive or non-invasive methods.

**Invasive Method**

The invasive intra-arterial blood pressure measurement and continuous monitoring, regarded as the gold standards, are done by utilizing an indwelling catheter in one of the umbilical,  radial, or the posterior tibial arteries, which is connected to a pressure transducer and via that to the multichannel display patient monitor. This method is generally reserved for sick and unstable infants, and for those who are extremely premature.

The following steps and precautions should be taken while measuring the blood pressure intra-arterially via the transducer.

- The transducer should be positioned at the level of the heart.

- There should be no air bubbles in the tube, as their presence might increase DBP and decrease SBP.

- A dicrotic notch should be seen on the arterial waveform.

- Tubing should be of low compliance and the smallest acceptable length, as an increase in the length will falsely decrease the values.

- The pressure transducer should be set at zero atmospheric pressure as the reference point.

- The transducer should be irrigated with a continuous heparin infusion.

- The umbilical catheter should be of appropriate size. A narrow catheter will falsely decrease the SBP.

- The umbilical artery catheter should be removed, preferably after 5 to 7 days, as prolonged catheterization may increase the risk of thrombus formation, leading to false readings.

**Non-invasive Methods**

The commonest and most widely used non-invasive method for measuring blood pressure in the neonatal intensive care unit is the automated oscillometry. This device detects the maximum blood pressure oscillations from the arterial blood flow as mean blood pressure (MBP), which is then converted into the projected systolic and diastolic BP by utilizing standard proprietary algorithms. The oscillometric BP measurements generally correlate well with the invasive intra-arterial readings. However, it may overestimate the intra-arterial SBP values by 3 to 8 mm Hg, thereupon over-diagnosing hypertension, and become inaccurate when MAP drops below 30 mm Hg, thus missing hypotension. The device may also underestimate SBP in small for gestational age infants.

For accuracy, the optimum cuff width is suggested to be in a ratio of 0.45 to 0.70 with the arm circumference, cover 80% of the length of the arm, and the size should be standardized for uniformity in the results. The BP becomes erroneously high if the cuff size is too small.  At the time of measurement, the infant should be lying in a supine position, quietly awake, calm, preferably sleeping, and about 1 to 1.5 hours postprandial. A minimum of three readings, 2 minutes apart, should be taken in the right arm as the preferred site. Using a sphygmomanometer is not recommended because the Korotkoff sounds are not loud enough to be reliably audible in this age group of infants.
