X-linked agammaglobulinemia being the most common type. Mainly presents after 6 to 9 months of age when maternal antibodies wear off. This can lead to life-threatening recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of agammaglobulinemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of agammaglobulinemia.
- Summarize the typical blood test findings associated with agammaglobulinemia.
- Outline the various management consideration for agammaglobulinemia.

- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst an interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
