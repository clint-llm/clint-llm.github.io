Cardiac tamponade is a medical or traumatic emergency that happens when enough fluid accumulates in the pericardial sacÂ compressing the heart and leading to a decrease in cardiac output and shock. The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest. The treatment of cardiac tamponade can be performed at the bedside or in the operating room.
