The initial examination within the first 24 hours of birth is critical in determining newborn patients' general well-being and identifying any red flags that may warrant further evaluation. There are many approaches to examining a newborn, many of which are acceptable. In every method, the most important aspect is keeping the order of the exam as consistent as possible to ensure that no portion of the exam is missed.

A newborn history includes the following:

- A review of the pregnancy, labor, and delivery, including any maternal or fetal prenatal testing.

- A review of the mother's previous pregnancies, the mother's health prior to pregnancy, and the maternal and paternal genetic history.
