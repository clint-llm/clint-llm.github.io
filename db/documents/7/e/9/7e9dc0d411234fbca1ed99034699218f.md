Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) represents the dysplastic changes that occur on a cellular level. AIN grade I is low-grade dysplasia (LGAIN), whereas AIN-II and AIN-III are grouped together as high-grade dysplasia (HGAIN). This grading system takes into account various cellular changes, such as abnormalities in the differentiation of squamous layers, mitotic activity, and nuclear membrane changes.

Anal canal cancers are most commonly squamous cell carcinoma (75%). The remainder is often adenocarcinoma, but other rare histologic subtypes include melanomas, basaloid carcinomas, small cell carcinomas, sarcomas, and lymphomas.
