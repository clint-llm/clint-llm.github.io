Multifocal cortical hyperexcitability is seen in children with PS. This is felt to be maturation related, and the location of the spikes often shifts with time. These epileptic discharges activate autonomic centers and result in the autonomic symptoms noted during the seizures. Due to the activation of the central autonomic network, tachycardia, hypertension, and vasopressin release may be noted.
