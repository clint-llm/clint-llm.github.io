In all cases of anticoagulation associated adverse events, the following tests are needed:

- Complete blood count

- Coagulation profile (prothrombin time. activated partial thromboplastin time, d-dimer)

- Platelet count

- CT scan of the head to rule out intracranial bleeding

- Echocardiogram if valve thrombosis is suspected

- Echocardiogram to assess for the presence of left atrial thrombus

- Nuclear scan to look for the source of bleeding in the GI tract

Other studies depend on patient presentation.
