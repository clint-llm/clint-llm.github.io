Stress fractures account for about 20% of all sports medicine injuries, and runners who average more than 25 miles a week are considered high risk.

In addition to the intrinsic and extrinsic factors already noted, there are additional factors influencing stress fracture development. One factor is a neuromuscular hypothesis.

Another factor influencing stress fracture development is overtraining, or a more current name would be relative energy deficiency syndrome. This is commonly seen as part of the female athlete triad. The athlete's training volume is too high, and calorie intake is too restricted, resulting in impaired recovery. This leads to disordered menstruation and hormonal imbalances, with estrogen levels falling, leading to osteoporosis with a stress fracture as a result. There is also a similar phenomenon in male endurance athletes who have similar high training volumes and restricted calorie intake. This will result in lower testosterone levels resulting in osteoporosis and stress fracture development.

Vitamin D is another potential factor influencing the development of stress fractures. In a prospective trial of Finnish military recruits, those who sustained a stress fracture had a lower average vitamin D concentration than those who did not. A level 1 randomized trial of female military recruits showed vitamin D supplementation might have prevented a significant percentage of trainees from developing a stress fracture.
