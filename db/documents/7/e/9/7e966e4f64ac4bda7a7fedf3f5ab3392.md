Today, most PET scanners are hybrid-imaging devices and are traditionally coupled to a computed tomogram (CT) scanner in a single gantry or, less commonly, to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). PET scans acquire data from patients injected with different radiopharmaceuticals. PET scans contain crystals that will interact with photons emitted from the patient.
