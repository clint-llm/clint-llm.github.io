Nursemaid's elbow, or "radial head subluxation" is a common injury in young children in which the radial head slips under the annular ligament resulting in pain and inability to supinate the forearm. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical exam and history, and reduction can typically be easily performed in the clinical setting. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of radial head subluxation, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of injury that occurs in nursemaid's elbow/radial head subluxation.
- Review the evaluation process and examination findings that accompany radial head subluxation.
- Summarize the treatment strategy for radial head subluxation, including means for reduction.
- Outline possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of nursemaid's elbow in children, and improve outcomes.
