Primary bone cancer is a rare diagnosis, with primary care providers unlikely to encounter a single case in their working life. Early diagnosis improves overall survival; however, delays remain common. History and examination form the first step in diagnosing PBC, and an urgent referral to a specialist center is needed for all patients with a possible diagnosis.

Pain is the most common symptom, described as deep-seated dull pain progressing over time, often becoming refractory to simple analgesia. Pain can be troublesome at night, and this is always a red flag. A mass may be palpable with localized tenderness. Patients may exhibit signs of systemic disease, including lethargy, malaise, and fever; however, even in high-grade tumors, these are often not present and may suggest metastatic disease. A pathological fracture can be the first sign, and any abnormal fracture requires further investigation. History of predisposing genetic conditions (Li-Fraumeni syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome) or diseases (Paget's disease) is crucial.

Physical examination should focus on the area of pain, tenderness, or mass. The site should be inspected and palpated, with size, consistency, mobility, location of the mass, and overlying skin changes noted. Lymph nodes should be palpated.
