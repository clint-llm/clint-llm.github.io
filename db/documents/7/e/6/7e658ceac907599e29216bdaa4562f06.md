The esophagus physiologically lacks eosinophils, and when present, the condition is considered to be pathologic. Eosinophilic esophagitis was once thought to be a component of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, it is now known to be a separate entity as we understand more about the esophagus being an active immunogenic organ. Eosinophils can be found in the esophagus in response to various stimuli or antigen. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune or antigen-mediated process. Clinically, it presents with various esophageal dysfunction, and pathologically, there is mucosal inflammation predominantly with eosinophils, which is confined to the esophagus only. Diseases which can cause eosinophilia should be ruled out before diagnosing a patient with EoE.
