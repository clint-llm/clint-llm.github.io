A parathyroid adenoma is part of a spectrum of parathyroid disease that also includes parathyroid hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma. History of radiation therapy and long-term calcium deficiency predisposes patients to parathyroid disease later in life. This activity explains the pathophysiology, classification, evaluation, and management in patients with parathyroid adenoma. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating and decreasing long-term morbidity in patients with parathyroid adenoma.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of parathyroid adenoma.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with parathyroid adenoma.
- Explain the management strategies in a patient with parathyroid adenoma.
- Summarize the importance of a cohesive, interprofessional team approach to caring for patients with parathyroid adenoma.
