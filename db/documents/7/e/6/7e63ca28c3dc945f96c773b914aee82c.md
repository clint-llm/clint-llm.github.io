The femoral sheath is a fascial tube encapsulating the key vascular structures passing through the retro-inguinal space, a critical transition point between the abdomen and the anterior thigh compartment. It is an important anatomical landmark for understanding the structures in the femoral triangle within which it lies and has clinical importance as the site of femoral hernias.
