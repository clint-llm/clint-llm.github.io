Coccidioides species exist as mycelia in the environment and the laboratory. Mycelia grow by apical extension forming true septae along their course. In one week, these mycelial cells undergo a process of autolysis and thinning of their cell walls. Some of the remaining cells in the colony are transformed into barrel-shaped, loosely adherent arthroconidia. The arthroconidia are loosely connected to each other, becoming airborne at the slightest perturbation. Arthroconidia are 2 microns to 5 microns in length and are of the right size to reach the terminal bronchiole when inhaled. Once inside the lung, arthroconidia undergo remodeling from rectangular to spherical forms known as spherules. This transformation is facilitated by the shedding of the outer layer of the arthroconidia.

The spherules grow to the size of 75 microns in diameter. The spherules divide internally by developing internal septae, which divide the spherule into compartments. Each compartment has endospores. As spherule impregnated with endospores grows, it eventually ruptures and releases the endospores in the region including the alveolar sacs. These endospores are picked up by the alveolar macrophages. The local release of endospores causes host response, and acute inflammation ensues. The endospores are capable of further multiplication within tissues and when released in the environment can lead to mycelial growth.

Occasionally, in susceptible patients, spherule may leave the lung to set up an extrapulmonary infection. The most likely routes of dissemination appear to be due to trafficking of the macrophages carrying the spherules or the endospores. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is frequently seen in coccidioidomycosis patients who have an extrapulmonary disease.

Histopathology of the tissues infected with coccidioidomycosis shows cellular components of both acute and chronic inflammation. Neutrophils and eosinophils are attracted to the local region when spherules rupture and release endospores. Chronic granulomatous infection is associated with mature unruptured spherules suggesting that the infection due to Ccoccidioides species has been controlled.

The mainstay of the defense against Coccidioides species is the T-lymphocytes, particularly the T-helper2 lymphocytes (Th2). Th2 dysfunction or deficiency has been found in patients with an extrapulmonary or disseminated disease. The innate cellular immunity is useful in the early infection when the arthroconidia reach the terminal bronchioles, when spherules are small, or when the endospores are released. As the spherules grow larger, the effector cells of innate immunity, for example, neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer cells become ineffective.
