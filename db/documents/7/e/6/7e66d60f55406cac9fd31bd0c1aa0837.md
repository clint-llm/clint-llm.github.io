The prognosis of multifocal motor neuropathy is usually good. Approximately 80% of patients respond to IVIG treatment. About 20% of the patients achieve long-term remission, while the remaining require periodic IVIG or SCIG treatments. Even in non-responders, muscle weakness progresses slowly, and the majority of the patients are able to perform activities of daily living. In one study, more than 94% remained employed.
