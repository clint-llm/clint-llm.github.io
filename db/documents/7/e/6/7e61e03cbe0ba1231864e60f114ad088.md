Lesions on the eyelid may be first encountered by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist or the emergency department physician. It is important to refer these patients to an ophthalmologist because the general clinician is usually not familiar with the anatomy or surgical principles of eyelid surgery. Lesions on the eyelid may be benign or malignant and the type of treatment depends on the size of lesion, adjacent spread and involvement of other organs.
