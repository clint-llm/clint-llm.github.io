Small bowel cancer overall includes a series of malignant lesions that, although rare, can be found throughout the small bowel. Education for clinicians should be focused on ensuring this is considered when ruling out causes for nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, as this may lead to earlier diagnostic imaging and diagnosis. Patients should be educated on alarm features or signs of complications that may arise once the diagnosis has been established. Depending on the patient's prognosis based on the identified lesion, supportive care should be provided by the involvement of the palliative care team and support groups.
