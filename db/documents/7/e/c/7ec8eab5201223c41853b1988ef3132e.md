Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) represent a group of severe systemic febrile illnesses caused by four families of viruses - Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, and Flaviviridae.

Most of the viruses implicated in these diseases require vectors for transmission to humans, with the majority being arthropod-borne or rodent-borne infections. Given their zoonotic nature, these diseases are generally confined to the endemic areas where their hosts live. However, given increased human migration and further globalization, these diseases are no longer limited to their geographic origins.
