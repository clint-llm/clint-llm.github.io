**Chemotherapy**

The efficacy of chemotherapy in the management of primary and recurrent ameloblastoma is still controversial. Many drug regimens have been used with surgery and/ or radiotherapy. This includes the following combinations: adriamycin, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide; vinblastine, cisplatin, and bleomycin; gemcitabine and carboplatin; and doxorubicin and cisplatin. However, more high-quality randomized control studies are needed to validate their use.

**Targeted Therapy**

Recent understanding of the molecular basis of the development of odontogenic tumors, especially ameloblastoma, led to the development of targeted therapies.

Similarly, different drugs have been manufactured to target the SMO mutation associated with ameloblastoma. This include vismodegib and itraconazole. However, some resistance mechanism against these drugs has been reported.
