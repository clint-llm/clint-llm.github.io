Excisional biopsy of an enlarged lymph node is required for diagnosis of Kikuchi disease, and immunohistochemistry helps rule out alternative differential diagnoses. Three histological stages have been described – the proliferative, necrotizing, and xanthomatous stage. The proliferative stage shows follicular hyperplasia with infiltrates composed of histiocytes and lymphocytes, with an absence of neutrophils and eosinophils. The necrotizing stage shows extensive histiocyte nuclear breakdown (karyorrhexis) and multiple necrotic foci, with lymph node architecture remaining intact.  Lastly, the xanthomatous stage shows foamy histiocytes with regression of necrosis.  Uniquely, throughout these stages, there is a lack of neutrophils or eosinophils, which helps differentiate Kikuchi disease from infectious etiologies

Immunohistochemistry will subsequently show histiocytes that are positive for myeloperoxidase, CD68, lysozyme, CD163, and CD4. It will also show T cells that are CD8 positive. Notably CD20 positive B cells will be absent

While the histopathology of Kikuchi disease is similar to SLE lymphadenitis, biopsy in SLE may show hematoxylin bodies (collections of nuclear DNA), DNA deposits in vessel walls, and areas of vasculitis around the areas of necrosis. These histologic characteristics point to lupus lymphadenitis rather than Kikuchi disease and help differentiate the two diseases
