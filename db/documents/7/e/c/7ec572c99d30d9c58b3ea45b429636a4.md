Patients should be educated on tobacco cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke. The US Preventative Services Task Force recommends the "5 A's" approach to guide clinicians into a conversation above tobacco cessation. This includes asking about tobacco use, advisement on quitting, assessing readiness for the patient to quit, assisting in tobacco cessation, and arranging to follow upÂ with the patient.
