Acitretin belongs to a group of drugs known as retinoids. Retinoids include natural and synthetic compounds that have similar activity to vitamin A. Vitamin A helps regulate the immune system, impacts cellular growth, differentiation, proliferation, and plays a role in embryonic development. Other effects of retinoids include immunologic anti-inflammatory effects, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor promotion. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and adverse events associated with acitretin so that interprofessional team members can work together to manage patients using the medication optimally.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for acitretin.
- Describe the adverse effects/toxicity with acitretin use.
- Outline the monitoring necessary for patients on acitretin therapy.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination for patients undergoing acitretin therapy to improve patient outcomes.
