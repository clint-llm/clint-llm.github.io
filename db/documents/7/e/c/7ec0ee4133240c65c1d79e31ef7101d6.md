As pericoronitis results from an overgrowth of bacteria in the hard-to-clean areas that form during third molar eruptions, good oral hygiene is crucial in preventing pericoronitis or worsening the disease.

Another way to deter developing pericoronitis is to remove a future source of infection. If upon radiographic examination, a patientâ€™s third molar has a poor prognosis to erupt into functional occlusion, which increases the likelihood of developing pericoronitis, it is fair to consider prophylactic third molar extractions.
