C1 fractures generallyÂ occur due to an axial loading mechanism, which can be combined with flexion/extension or rotation to create the typical fracture patterns. The area is subject to high stresses from a large moment arm of the cranium. Low-energy trauma in the elderly and high-impact trauma in young cohorts have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atlas fractures.****
