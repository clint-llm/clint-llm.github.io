Research has revealed that inhaled corticosteroids cross the placenta. However, research has found no significant association between ICS and congenital organ malformations.

A 6-month observational study found that elderly patients had a sustained improved knowledge and use of inhalers when educated by an on-staff pharmacist.

Another study assessed the effect of pretreatment with fluticasone for six weeks before seasonal allergen provocation; this was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. They found that there were significant histologic changes after four weeks of treatment with 200 mg of fluticasone twice daily.

Since fluticasone is now available in the USA as an over the counter medication, health practitioners should work in an interprofessional team to ensure compliance and proper use; this collaborative team approach includes physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, communicating across disciplines to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects and patient risk.
