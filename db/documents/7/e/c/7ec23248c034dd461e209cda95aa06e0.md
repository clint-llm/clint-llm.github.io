Fundamentally, KS is the result of a defect in the GnRH neurons of the hypothalamus or their differentiation and migration to the hypothalamus during embryonic development. The cause of this condition is genetic but can be the result of a multitude of different genetic mutations. Mutations in approximately 40 different genes have been reported to be connected with HH conditions, including KS, and present with slight variations in secondary features. The most common defects related to KS are in the genes ANOS1 and FGFR1, but approximately 35 to 45% of cases are not explained by the currently identified genetic abnormalities.

One gene of particular interest is the KISS1 gene encoding the kisspeptin signaling molecule. Kisspeptin is a potent initiator of the production of GnRH in the hypothalamus, and its production is known to be impacted by environmental factors.
