Eyes that lack sufficient capsular support for intraocular lens (IOL) placement present a unique surgical challenge. Options for IOL placement include anterior chamber intraocular lenses (ACIOLs), iris-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lenses (PCIOLs), and scleral-fixated intraocular lenses (SFIOLs).

However, SFIOLs provide a better ocular safety profile than ACIOLs or iris fixated IOLs.
