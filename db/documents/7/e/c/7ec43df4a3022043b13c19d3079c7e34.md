The posterior auricular artery perfuses the majority of the ear and the scalp posterior to the ear. This perfusion region will also supply blood to the greater auricular nerve (C2, C3 spinal roots) and the lesser occipital nerve (C2 spinal roots). The facial nerve also receives perfusion from the posterior auricular artery at the stylomastoid foramen opening.
