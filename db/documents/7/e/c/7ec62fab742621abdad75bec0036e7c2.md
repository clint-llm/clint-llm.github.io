- Handheld electrocautery: Use electrocautery at 90-degree angle to nail to make a hole through the nail over the central area of hematoma. A capillary tube such as a heparinized hematocrit tube can be used to draw out the hematoma.

- Needle: Place an 18-gauge needle at a 90-degree angle over the central area of hematoma and rotate needle in a drilling fashion to create a hole through the nail. Use smaller gauge needle in children if needed. If you use a smaller gauge needle, several holes may need to be drilled to provide relief.

- If no other supplies present: Use a heated paperclip. Heat paperclip over a flame until red hot and touch to nail at 90-degree angle to burn a hole through nail over the central area of hematoma.

Once a hole is created it is expected that blood will drain out from the hematoma resolving most of the patient's pain. It may take more than one trephination to decompress the hematoma completely. Take care when advancing through the nail to avoid damage to the nail bed. Bandage site with sterile gauze in instruct patient to keep digit clean and dry.
