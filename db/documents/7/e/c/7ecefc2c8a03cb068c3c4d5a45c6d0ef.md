Long arm splints may be applied by many healthcare workers including therapists and orthopedic nurses.  Long arm splints are a valuable tool in the treatment of a variety of upper extremity injuries. This form of splinting can provide excellent immobilization while allowing for swelling that often accompanies acute injuries. Typically, a long arm splint is the initial form of immobilization. It typically is removed, and patients are transitioned into more definitive immobilization such as a cast. The practitioner needs to take time to become familiar with the materials and techniques needed to make a well-padded and molded splint that properly positions a patient to maintain a reduction and allow for soft tissue swelling. An interprofessional team consisting of emergency physicians, orthopedists, and emergency or orthopedic nurses will improve care and outcomes. [Level 5]

Patient monitoring after splint placement is recommended. If the splint is too tight, it can lead to compartment syndrome, without devastating consequences.
