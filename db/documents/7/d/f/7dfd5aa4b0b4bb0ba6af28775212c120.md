As in other knee conditions, mechanical derangement, direct trauma, obesity, and overuse have all been implicated in developing pes anserine bursitis.Â Medial knee osteoarthritis is an early and common finding in patients with this condition. Diabetes mellitus was also reported in a significant proportion of patients with pes anserine bursitis.

In particular, sports may make one prone to pes anserine inflammatory conditions, including long-distance running, basketball, and racquet sports.
