Endometrial ablation is a minimally invasive gynecologic surgical procedure designed to alleviate abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in women who have met their desired parity. Abnormal uterine bleeding is defined as heavy, irregular, or intermenstrual bleeding. AUB is a common gynecologic complaint affecting 10 to 30% of reproductive-age women.
