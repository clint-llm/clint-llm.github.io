The exact etiological basis of Behcet disease remains unknown, although genetics and environmental factors have been found to play a role.

Increased prevalence along the "Silk Route" and familial aggregation suggest a genetic element, although Behcet disease does not follow a mendelian inheritance. The most frequent association is with carriers of HLA-B51/B5, who are at high risk for developing Behcet disease compared to non-carriers.

Exposure to infectious agents, especially hypersensitivity to Streptococcus sanguinis antigens, has suggested a pathological role.Staphylococcus aureus, Herpes simplex virus type 1, and Prevotella species, have been suggested as potential culprits, their direct association with the development of Behcet disease has not been confirmed.
