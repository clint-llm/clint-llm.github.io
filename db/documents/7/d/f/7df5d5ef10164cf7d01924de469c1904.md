Sick sinus syndrome is defined by the presence of ECG findings and symptoms together, ECG finding alone, especially sinus bradycardia, does not indicate the presence of sick sinus syndrome:

**ECG Findings**

- Periods of inappropriate and often severe sinus bradycardia.

- Sinus pauses, sinus arrests and sinus exits blocks that can happen with and without appropriate escape rhythm.

- Alternating tachycardia and bradycardia, referred to as a tachy-brady syndrome, which could also be associated with other supraventricular tachycardias.

The key to diagnosing sinus node dysfunction is to establish a correlation between the patient symptoms and the ECG findings at the time of symptoms. It is also beneficial to review previous ECG tracing to check for any changes in the rhythm upon the start of the symptoms.

**Exercise Stress Testing:**

If the diagnosis could not be made based on history, and ECG then exercise stress testing is necessary. Things to look for is the failure of appropriate chronotropic response to exercise, defined as less than 80 percent of the predictable heart rate response to exercise. Also, it will exclude myocardial ischemia and help to program the devices for patients who ultimately receive a permanent pacemaker.

**Ambulatory ECG monitoring:**

If all the above failed in making the diagnosis of sinus node dysfunction, then an ambulatory ECG monitoring should be considered. In one study that included 55 symptomatic patients, 24-hour Holter monitor tracking detected the underlying arrhythmia causing the symptoms in 30 patients (55 %).

**Review of potentially reversible causes:**

Patients who are taking medications that can be contributing to their symptoms (beta blocker, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmic) should be monitored off of these medications and on the ECG monitor to assess for symptoms reversibility as well as the resolution of the ECG findings.
