Facet joint disease is a chronic process that can cause pain for the remainder of an individual’s lifetime. Facet joint disease is a progressive disease. The spinal and joint degeneration typically progresses as the patient ages. It is essential to prevent the degeneration from progressing by maintaining a healthy weight and active lifestyle. Physical therapy and core strengthening exercises can strengthen the spine and reduce the stress on the facet joints. Interventional procedures such as medial branch blocks and radiofrequency ablations do not treat the underlining cause of the patient’s pain but allow the patient’s pain to be more manageable. Patients can have a reduction in their pain for months at a time, but some studies have shown an even longer-term decrease in pain of up to 2 years after radiofrequency ablations.
