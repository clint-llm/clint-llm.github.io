As mentioned previously, the most common clinical conditions or disease processes that result in the breech presentation are those that affect fetal motility or the vertical polarity of the uterine cavity.

Conditions that change the vertical polarity or the uterine cavity, or affect the ease or ability of the fetus to turn into the vertex presentation in the third trimester include:

- Mullerian anomalies: Septate uterus, bicornuate uterus, and didelphys uterus

- Placentation: Placenta previa as the placenta is occupying the inferior portion of the uterine cavity. Therefore, the presenting part cannot engage

- Uterine leiomyoma: Mainly larger myomas located in the lower uterine segment, often intramural or submucosal, that prevent engagement of the presenting part.

- Prematurity

- Aneuploidies and fetal neuromuscular disorders commonly cause hypotonia of the fetus, inability to move effectively

- Congenital anomalies:  Fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma, fetal thyroid goiter

- Polyhydramnios: Fetus is often in unstable lie, unable to engage

- Oligohydramnios: Fetus is unable to turn to vertex due to lack of fluid

- Laxity of the maternal abdominal wall: Uterus falls forward, the fetus is unable to engage in the pelvis.

The risk of cord prolapse varies depending on the type of breech. Incomplete or footling breech carries the highest risk of cord prolapse at 15% to 18%, while complete breech is lower at 4% to 6%, and frank breech is uncommon at 0.5%.
