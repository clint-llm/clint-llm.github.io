The treatment following diagnosis will depend on the treatment guidelines and recommendations for each disease subset. Avoidance of the inciting trigger in case of adverse drug events, hemolysis, or drug-induced autoimmune disease is very important. Management of cytopenias should be done according to a defined protocol. Systemic glucocorticoids represent another important intervention to suppress antibody response and prevent tissue damage.

**Examples of Management Protocols**

In the case of a drug-induced adverse event, drug-induced lupus, or cytopenias, the drug should be discontinued.

Antibiotic therapy should be started in cases with acute rheumatic fever to eradicate the carriage of group A streptococcus. Penicillin V and benzylpenicillin are primarily used for this purpose. Oral cephalosporins are used as an alternative therapy for penicillin-allergic patients. Symptomatic treatment of acute manifestations like arthritis (with NSAIDs), carditis (with aspirin or oral prednisone), and chorea (with diazepam) should be provided. Prevention of progression of cardiac damage by giving prophylaxis against future group A streptococcal infections should be done. Benzathine penicillin G is administered intramuscularly for prophylaxis.

In immune-mediated thyrotoxicosis (Graves disease), antithyroid drugs, including propylthiouracil and methimazole, are started. Radioiodine ablation and surgical excision should also be considered. Glucocorticoids are used for ophthalmopathy.

In myasthenia gravis, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like pyridostigmine are started. Immunosuppressive therapy (like corticosteroids) is used for the patient's refractory to pyridostigmine therapy. Thymectomy is considered in patients refractory to drug therapy. Plasma exchange and intravenous immune globulin should be given in myasthenic crises.
