Peripheral cyanosis is the bluish discoloration of the distal extremities (Hands, fingertips, toes), and can sometimes involve circumoral and periorbital areas. Mucous membranes are generally not involved. Peripheral cyanosis is rarely a life-threatening medical emergency. However, it is essential to determine the underlying cause. Its timely management is crucial to prevent potential complications. This activity reviews peripheral cyanosis and outlines its evaluation and management. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of central and peripheral cyanosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of central and ischemic peripheral cyanosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for central and peripheral cyanosis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage cyanosis and improve outcomes.
