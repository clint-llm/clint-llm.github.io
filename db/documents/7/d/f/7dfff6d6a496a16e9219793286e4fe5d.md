The duration of pregnancy, from implantation of a fertilized ovum to birth, is taken as 266 days. However, as pregnancy dating is typically from the first day of the last menstrual period, the duration of pregnancy is considered to be 280 days on average. This duration is the amount of time by which approximately half of all women will deliver their babies. Babies born from 37 0/7 weeks gestation to 38 6/7 weeks are considered early term. Those born between 39 0/7 weeks and 40 6/7 weeks are labeled full term. Babies born 41 0/7 weeks through 41 6/7 weeks are titled late-term. Any baby born at 42 0/7 weeks gestation and beyond is deemed post-term.
