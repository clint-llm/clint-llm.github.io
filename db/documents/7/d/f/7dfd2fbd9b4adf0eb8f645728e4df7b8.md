PHO is a self-limiting illness, and the disease becomes stationary or resolves spontaneously after the active phase during adolescence years. The prognosis in SHO, on the other hand, is related to underlying disease but worse clinical outcomes have been reported in cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, and asbestosis. Its prognostic value in malignancies has not been studied.
