Gram-positive organisms have highly variable growth and resistance patterns. The SCOPE project (Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiologic Importance) found that in those with an underlying malignancy, gram-positive organisms accounted for 62 percent of all bloodstream infections in 1995 and 76 percent in 2000 while gram-negative organisms accounted for 22 percent in 1995 and 14 percent in 2000. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of gram-positive bacterial infections and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how to evaluate for a gram-positive bacterial infection. 
- Identify common infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. 
- Describe treatment strategies for gram-positive bacterial infections. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to provide quality care to patients with gram-positive bacterial infections.
