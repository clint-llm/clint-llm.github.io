From a surgical perspective, thoracotomy instruments are used for pneumonectomy. This includes a special set of rib spreaders, contractors, special types of thoracic, tissue forceps, and scissors.

FromÂ an anesthetic management viewpoint, pneumonectomy requires lung isolation techniques; this can be achieved by a left or right double-lumen endobronchial tube, use of a bronchial blocker, or endobronchial placement of the endotracheal tube.
