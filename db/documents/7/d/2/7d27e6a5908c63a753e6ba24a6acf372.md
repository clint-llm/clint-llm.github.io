Through assimilation and accommodation of the object, Piaget’s theory of cognitive development is characterized by a stepwise move toward adaptation. Assimilation is the process by which a child applies previously learned adaptive techniques to novel external objects and contexts--e.g. a baby putting everything in its mouth. Accommodation is the tendency of an organism to modify an existing schema to a novel event--e.g. learning a new skill. Piaget presents assimilation and accommodation as a synthesis that provides the impetus for intellectual development. Because these two adaptive processes are in constant conflict they produce a dynamic and balanced system that results in the further cognitive development of the child. Thus, via the empirically derived dynamic relationship with its' environment, the child is able to progress. From Piaget, we have an understanding that a child’s cognition develops further as he passes from one stage to the next.
