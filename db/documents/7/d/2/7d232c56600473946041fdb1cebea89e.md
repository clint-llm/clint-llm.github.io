The following are the indications of performing a Manougian procedure:

- Enlargement of the aortic root, which may be small, calcified, or fibrotic in adults to avoid patient prosthesis mismatch

- Enlargement of small aortic roots in children when undergoing aortic valve replacement

- Performing a root enlargement so a larger bioprosthetic valve may be placed in a patient who may later require a valve in valve replacement through transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
