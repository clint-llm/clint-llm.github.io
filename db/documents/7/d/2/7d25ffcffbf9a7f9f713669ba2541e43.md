# Continuing Education Activity

The goals of this activity are to review some subsets of patients that are at the highest risk for difficult or failed intubation. Discuss techniques, strategies, and algorithms to aid successful airway management when encountering unanticipated difficult intubation. This article will help equip clinicians to anticipate when encountering the unanticipated difficult intubation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify some subsets of patients most at risk for difficult or failed intubation.
- Summarize predictors of difficult video laryngoscopy, supraglottic airway placement, and cricothyrotomy.

- Explain the use of a supraglottic airway as a conduit to intubation.
- Explain the incorporation of algorithms into practice to guide airway management by the interprofessional healthcare team.

# Introduction

For anesthesiologists, emergency medicine, pulmonary or critical care physicians, learning how to intubate is a foundational and life-saving procedural skill. Preparation should include reviewing the patient’s history, presenting pathology, doing a multi-faceted airway examination, and assembling needed equipment. There should be a primary plan and backup plans in the event of failure.  Unfortunately, there are findings of clinician poor judgment and suboptimal preparation resulting in negative outcomes.

There will also be patients where difficult intubations cannot be predicted in advance.

Some findings from the Fourth National Audit Project (NAP4) of the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Difficult Airway Society (DAS) executive summary (2011) include:

- Failure to assess the airway

- Failure to have a plan B or plan C when the initial plan fails

- Failure to proceed with awake fiberoptic intubation even when indicated

- Repeated attempts at intubation despite deteriorating oxygenation

- Obesity as a risk factor for difficulty

- Failure of emergency percutaneous cricothyrotomy

- Aspiration with repeated intubation attempts resulting in death

- Failure to recognize an esophageal intubation

The incidence of severe complications including death, hypoxic brain injury, or emergency surgical airway was 1 in 22,000 in a database of 2.9 million general anesthetics. This database showed the incidence of complications was 35 times higher in emergency departments and 55 times higher in intensive care units. It is likely that not all critical events were reported and that the incidence was higher than stated.

There were similarly discouraging conclusions found in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) closed-claims analysis.

It is important to be precise in terminology when documenting an airway procedure. Is there a difficult or failed mask ventilation?  Is there a difficult or failed direct or video laryngoscopy? Is there difficult tracheal intubation due to endotracheal tube delivery?  Is there a difficult or failed supraglottic airway placement? These questions must be answered in detail so that the next provider will have the necessary information to proceed safely with the patient's airway management.

# Anatomy and Physiology

Some anatomic predictors of difficult intubation include: small mouth opening, short thyromental distance, full set of teeth with prominent incisors, reduced mandibular protrusion, reduced submandibular compliance, short neck, large neck circumference, limited neck extension, Mallampati 3 or 4, obesity, surgery or radiation-induced changes. These are not often critical but do additively contribute to a higher likelihood of difficult direct laryngoscopy but may not for video laryngoscopy.

In addition to the anatomical airway factors, the physiologically difficult airway is a newer concept in airway assessment.  This assessment encompasses that airway management is difficult due to hypoxia, hypotension, severe metabolic acidosis, or right ventricular failure.

There can also be contextual issues that contribute to difficult or failed airway management. Examples may be the skill level of the clinician, available help, proper equipment, or patient factors such as intoxication or disability.

# Indications

Pregnant patients requiring emergency general anesthesia, trauma patients with cervical spine injury with or without concurrent closed head injury, morbidly obese patients, and patients with previous head and neck cancer are some subsets of patients at high risk for difficult or failed intubation.

Failed intubation occurs in about 1 in 390 patients, and maternal mortality is four times higher than in other populations.

In trauma patients with a cervical spine injury, there should be a heightened suspicion for difficult intubation because of a rigid cervical collar for immobilization, higher Cormack-Lehane views of the larynx, and high aspiration risk. Intubation is often required for airway protection, mechanical ventilation, and/or emergency surgery. There may also be a concurrent closed head injury. Avoiding neck movement during intubation attempts and avoiding hypotension, hypoxia, and hypercarbia are all paramount.

Obesity and especially morbid obesity present challenges in all aspects of airway management, from bag-mask ventilation to laryngoscopy to emergency cricothyrotomy.

# Personnel

This article is directed to anesthesiologists, emergency medicine, pulmonary and critical care physicians, plus any other clinicians responsible for emergency airway management and intubation.

# Preparation

The following are some tools and “pearls” to help prepare for high-risk patients and when faced with unanticipated difficult intubation.

Place a low-flow nasal cannula or high-flow oxygen if available on patients. It will extend safe apnea time, especially in obese patients.

**NO DESAT**is an acronym coined by Dr. Richard Levitan.

- **N**- nasal

- **O**- oxygen

- **D**- during

- **E**- efforts

- **S**- securing

- **A**- a

- **T**- tube

The Vortex cognitive aid is a simple, practical but effective visual tool.

There are also reminders of interventions that might help.  Some of these include re-positioning the head or neck, applying external laryngeal manipulation (ELM), changing laryngoscope blade type, or attempting video laryngoscopy. Adjuncts such as a bougie or stylet may be helpful. Suctioning may aid.  Additionally, administering a drug for paralysis likely will improve the situation.

The Difficult Airway Society (DAS) has published several algorithms. One especially salient to this article is for the management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adult patients.

- Plan A: Effective mask ventilation and successful intubation. If unsuccessful, then there are suggestions to improve mask ventilation and successfully intubate. These include repositioning the patient's head or neck, administering a paralytic drug, applying external laryngeal manipulation, removing cricoid pressure, or using an adjunct such as a bougie.  If still unsuccessful, then the algorithm moves to Plan B.

- Plan B: Maintaining oxygenation with a supraglottic airway.  If successful, there is an opportunity to regroup. These options include aborting the procedure, using the supraglottic airway as is, and proceeding or using it as a conduit to intubation. If still unsuccessful, then the algorithm moves to Plan C.

- Plan C: Reattempt mask ventilation with paralysis and using a two-person technique. If still unsuccessful, the algorithm moves to Plan D.

- Plan D: Emergency front of neck access (eFONA) - open scalpel cricothyrotomy

A maximum of 3 + 1 laryngoscopy attempts (direct or video) is emphasized. It is unlikely that more than three attempts by the same clinician will be successful and can result in airway trauma.

Use of a second-generation supraglottic airway is recommended. This separates the respiratory from the gastrointestinal tracts, has a cuff with higher sealing pressures, and is more protective against aspiration compared to earlier supraglottic airways.

Open cricothyrotomy, also called the emergency front of neck access (eFONA), is now preferred. The NAP 4 executive summary findings found that an open approach achieved higher rescue success with fewer complications than the needle cricothyroidotomy when an emergency surgical airway was required.

As previously mentioned, there is also an algorithm for the failed intubation in obstetric patients requiring general anesthesia.

Other guidelines address airway management in the intensive care unit (ICU), awake intubation, and extubation. All are based on an extensive review of the literature, excellent resources, and free. Readers are encouraged to review all these guidelines on the DAS website.

# Technique or Treatment

Video laryngoscopy has revolutionized airway management. The premise is that of looking around the corner, which is the tongue, instead of aligning the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes. The Cormack-Lehane views of the larynx are often one to two grades improved with higher first-pass success.

When attempting intubation with video laryngoscopy, it is not often due to the inability to see the glottic opening if difficulty is encountered; it is in the delivery of the endotracheal tube. The patient’s head should be in a neutral position with a “limited” glottic view. The classic sniffing position may make intubation more difficult.

There are two different types of video laryngoscopes - non-channeled and channeled video laryngoscopes. Non-channeled ones are those more frequently available. Channeled scopes have a more acute angle and a conduit that guides the endotracheal tube towards the glottic opening. This results in the least neck movement and is especially useful in a patient with an unstable cervical spine injury. In reviewing the literature, the term video laryngoscopy is used generically without always delineating which type.

Additionally, there are several techniques for using supraglottic airways as a conduit for intubation successfully.  Using an intubating laryngeal mask airway with a specially designed endotracheal tube that is passed blindly through the supraglottic airway is one way.  This type of supraglottic airway is especially useful in obese patients.

Another tactic for securing the airway through a supraglottic airway device is by loading an endotracheal tube or airway exchange catheter over a fiberoptic scope and then driving the flexible scope through the supraglottic airway device so that the endotracheal tube or exchange catheter can be placed in the trachea.

# Complications

Complications of difficult or failed airway management include hypoxia, aspiration, esophageal intubation, emergency surgical airway, cardiovascular instability, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic encephalopathy, and death.

# Clinical Significance

There is no perfect way to predict when difficult intubations will occur.

Predictors of failed mask ventilation have been reviewed in the Airway Assessment StatPearls article.

Predictors of difficult or failed video laryngoscopy include:

- Obesity

- Clinician inexperience with video laryngoscopy

- Blood, secretions, or vomit in the oropharynx

- Higher Cormack-Lehane grades with direct laryngoscopy

- Limited mouth opening

Predictors of difficult or failed supraglottic airway placement include:

- Obesity

- A small mouth opening

- Upper airway pathology

- Limited neck extension

- Cricoid pressure

Predictors of difficult or failed emergency front-of-neck airway access (eFONA) include:

- Obesity

- Indurated skin changes due to surgery and/or radiation

- Flexed neck deformity

- Displaced trachea

- Female sex

Obesity and especially morbid obesity may make airway management more difficult and contribute to an unsuccessful rescue.  This may mandate that the best approach might be awake intubation in some cases.

Management strategies for the physiologically difficult airway include:

- Providing supplemental oxygen (low or high flow) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)

- Treating hypotension with intravenous fluids or pressors

- Delaying intubation until the severe metabolic acidosis is improved

- Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to assess the severity of right ventricular dysfunction/failure

- Choice of drugs based on the patient's hemodynamics

- Possibly securing the airway with the patient awake and breathing spontaneously

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Human factors play a role in decisions and especially in situations of failed airway management. Avoiding loss of situational awareness, avoiding perseveration on the same task, or delaying performing a surgical cricothyrotomy is essential.

Attending difficult airway workshops to practice techniques, networking with experts, and looking for opportunities to practice them in elective procedures are excellent ways to build skillsets.
