Due to the relative scarcity of NMOSD cases, consensus guidelines are challenging to establish. Most case series recommend a short course of immunosuppressive therapy (usually a corticosteroid), followed by some form of chronic immunosuppressive therapy.

Chronic immunosuppressive therapy can be accomplished with azathioprine or rituximab as first-line agents. Second-line agents may include mycophenolate or methotrexate.
