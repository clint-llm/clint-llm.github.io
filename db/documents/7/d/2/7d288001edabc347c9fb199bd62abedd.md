Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is a rare skin disorder that can be difficult to diagnose. If a patient first presents to the primary care physician, pediatrician, or mid-level provider with a lesion suggestive of angiokeratoma circumscriptum, referral to a dermatologist is appropriate for further evaluation and treatment. Dermatology specialty-trained nurses can provide a great deal of assistance during any management strategy; diathermy, curettage and electrocautery, cryosurgery, and surgical excision. They can assist in the procedure, coordinate care between various clinicians, and counsel patients, and answer questions. This type of interprofessional team approach is crucial to achieving optimal patient outcomes. [Level V]
