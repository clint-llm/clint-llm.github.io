The initial management of a patient with Waddell triad begins with the usual primary assessment or survey for trauma. The primary survey addresses airway, breathing, circulation, neurologic deficit, and exposure of the patient and control of the environment (ABCDE).

**Key Points**

**Airway/Cervical Spine**

Remember to check for cervical spine injury while optimizing oxygenation and ventilation. The current standard is to immobilize the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine in a neutral position with a stiff collar, head blocks, tape, or cloth positioned across the forehead, torso, and thighs, and a rigid backboard. This restrains the child. Airway obstruction usually manifests as snoring, gurgling, hoarseness, stridor, and/or diminished breath sounds. Airway obstruction can also result from fractures of the facial bones, secretions such as blood or vomitus, crush injuries of the larynx, or foreign body aspiration. If the healthcare preofessionals need to open the airway, a jaw thrust without head tilt is recommended. This procedure minimizes cervical spine motion.

**Breathing**

Breathing can be assessed by counting the respiratory rate, visualizing chest wall motion for symmetry, expansion, accessory muscle use, and auscultating breath sounds. In addition to observing for cyanosis, pulse oximetry monitoring is the standard. If ventilation is inadequate, bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen must be initiated immediately, followed by endotracheal intubation.

**Circulation**

Circulation deals with the perfusion of the various body organs and identifying signs of poor perfusion or shock. The most common shock in trauma is hypovolemic shock caused by hemorrhage. Signs include tachycardia, weak pulse, delayed capillary refill, cool, mottled, pale skin, and altered mental status. Loss of more than 40% of blood volume causes severe hypotension that may become irreversible; therefore, direct pressure should be applied to control external hemorrhage. Two large bore IVs should be inserted to maintain adequate hydration. Aggressive, intravenous fluid resuscitation is crucial in early stages of shock to prevent further deterioration. An isotonic crystalloid solution, such as lactated Ringer injection or normal saline (20 mL/kg) should be infused rapidly. Serial hematocrits should be measured to ensure that there is no acute bleeding but if the patient remains in shock despite fluid boluses, then 10 to 15 mL/kg of cross-matched, packed red blood cells should be transfused. Intra-thoracic bleeding, if present, is usually managed by placing a chest tube for drainage. Blood loss from a femur fracture can be massive and may require multiple blood transfusions.

**Neurologic Deficit**

Neurologic deficit can be assessed by determining the level of consciousness which is classified using the AVPU scoring system:

- 
Alert

- Responsive to Verbal commands only,

- Responsive to Painful stimuli only

- 
Unresponsive

In addition, a Glasgow coma ccale (GCS) score should be assigned to every child with significant head trauma. This scale assesses eye opening and motor and verbal responses. The GCS helps categorize neurologic disability, and serial measurements can help identify improvement or deterioration over time. A child with severe neurologic impairment (a GCS score of 8 or less) should be intubated. Head injuries account for at least 75% of pediatric blunt trauma deaths and are usually managed with supportive care, but one should always monitor the child for the development of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to an epidural or subdural hematoma. Signs of increased ICP, including progressive neurologic deterioration and transtentorial brain herniation, must be treated immediately with brief hyperventilation and Neurosurgical consultation in case emergency surgery is necessary.

**Exposure and Environmental Control**

Upon arrival at the emergency room, all clothing should be removed to reveal any injuries. Cutting is the quickest method and minimizes unnecessary patient movement. Health care professionals should also remember that children often can arrive hypothermic because of their higher body surface area to mass ratios. Warming techniques include the use of radiant heat, heated blankets, and intravenous fluids.

Overall, there is no systematic treatment for the femur fractures in children. However, other factors should be considered, for example, the age of the child, the soft tissue injuries, the type and location of the fracture, the concomitant head, thoracic and abdominal trauma, and the surgeon’s expertise and the family’s psychosocial situation. Trauma scores provide an objective description of a patient’s condition and help clinicians recognize the individuals who have sustained the most severe injuries and need the most immediate medical care. The pediatric trauma score (PTS), for example, can easily be applied for the triage (patient classification according to the severity) of these particular patients at the scene of injury and in the hospital. It also has multiple applications which include predicting the chance of survival and degree of central nervous system impairment.
