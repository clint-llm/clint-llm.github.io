Pediatric fractures most frequently involve physeal plates in 12% of long bone fractures. These physes are cartilaginous and represent the weakest parts of a bone. Tillaux fracture represents 2.9 % of juvenile epiphyseal growth plate injuries

**Clinical anatomy:**at the lateral distal end of the tibia, there is a triangular concavity for the distal fibular shaft. Distal to this concavity, there are anterior and posterior tibial tubercles. The interosseous ligament attaches the tibia to the fibula at the level of the triangular concavity and forms part of the ankle syndesmosis. Other parts of the syndesmosis are; the anteroinferior tibiofibular ligament, which attaches to the anterior tibial tubercle (Chaput Tubercle), and the anterior aspect of the lateral malleolus (Wagstaffe tubercle), and the posteroinferior tibiofibular ligament, which attaches to the posterior tibial tubercle to the posterior aspect of the lateral malleolus
