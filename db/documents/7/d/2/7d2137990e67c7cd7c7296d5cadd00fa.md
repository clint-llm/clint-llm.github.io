Cranial nerve II (CN II or optic nerve) runs along the midline of the ventral surface of the brain and conveys visual information from the retina of each eye to the corresponding region of the primary visual cortex. The right half of the visual field of both eyes is processed by the left half of the retina, while the right half of the retina processes the left half of the visual field. These retinal ganglion cells project myelinated axons, carrying CN II sensory afferent fibers, through the optic chiasm, where optic nerve fibers from the nasal half of each retina decussate to the contralateral side of the brain for processing. This decussation allows for greater organization of visual processing by directing all optic nerve fibers relaying information from the left visual field of both eyes to the right hemisphere of the brain and conversely, all fibers carrying the right visual field information to the left hemisphere. The optic chiasm positioning is along the midline of the ventral subarachnoid space of the brain, inferior to the hypothalamus and anterior communicating artery, and superior to the pituitary gland situated within the sella turcica. After passing through the optic chiasm, the optic nerve becomes the optic tract that synapses to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and subsequently projects optic radiations to the primary visual cortex (V1) of the occipital lobe. The optic tract also projects to the superior colliculus, pretectal nuclei, and suprachiasmatic nuclei.
