Depending on the type of surgery, either general surgeons or other specialized surgeons may perform lymph node dissection. Breast surgeons usually perform axillary lymphadenectomy. Gynecologic oncologists are specialists for pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection when patients undergo total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for gynecological malignancies. Urologists perform retroperitoneal lymph node dissections for testicular cancers and pelvic lymph node dissections for penile cancers. Also, otorhinolaryngologists are surgical specialists who perform cervical lymph nodes dissection in patients with thyroid and head and neck cancer.
