The goal of ossiculoplasty is to reestablish ossicular chain continuity and improve the air conduction thresholds in patients suffering from conductive hearing loss. Chronic otitis media and its sequelae such as cholesteatoma and ossicular erosion are responsible for over 80% of ossicular chain disruption cases.

The remaining cases are due to blunt and penetrating trauma causing disarticulation, congenital ossicular fixation, acquired ossicular fixation from tympanosclerosis, congenital malformations, congenital absence of ossicles, otosclerosis, and middle ear neoplasms.

The incus is involved in the majority of these cases, particularly the long process, followed by the stapes.

The restoration of ossicular chain continuity is vital as prolonged conductive hearing loss can lead to poor language development, cognition, and learning.
