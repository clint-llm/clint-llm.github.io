Functional cells of the male reproductive system primarily consist of Leydig and Sertoli cells found in the testes. Leydig cells are found in the interstitium of the testes adjacent to the seminiferous tubules. On histology, they have pink cytoplasm and can be identified by pink crystals of Reinke. They produce testosterone, a steroid hormone that exerts its effects by binding intracellular receptors of different tissues and regulating protein expression.
