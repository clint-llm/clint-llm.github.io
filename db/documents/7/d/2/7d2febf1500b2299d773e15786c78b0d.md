In terms of surgical significance, the flexor hallucis longus has a role in Achilles (calcaneal) tendon rupture. A torn Achilles tendon usually presents as a patient reporting a "popping" feeling during strenuous exercise. Achilles tendon ruptures are especially common in patients with intermittent physical activity and are the most common tendon rupture in the lower extremity.

With the flexor hallucis longus tendon having proximity to the Achilles tendon, the flexor hallucis longus is the most commonly used tendon for tendon transfer when the Achilles tendon is irreparable. The Achilles tendon usually is irreparableÂ with a chronic retracted tear. The combination of its line of pull and proximity makes it the ideal candidate for Achilles tendon replacement. The surgical procedure for the flexor hallucis longus tendon replacing the Achilles tendon is called transfer for Achilles reconstruction.
