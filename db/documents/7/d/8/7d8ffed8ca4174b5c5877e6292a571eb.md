Enterohemorrhagic E. coli colitis has a good prognosis for recovery when patients do not have systemic manifestations of diarrheal illness. HUS complicates up to 10% of E. coli 0157:H7 cases, with higher risk reported for younger children, especially those under 5 years old. When patients develop HUS complications, the risk of mortality approaches 5%.
