Surgical reconstruction of a damaged or resected mandible is performed to restore functional mastication, the oral phase of swallowing, dental occlusion, and cosmesis of the lower face. Trans-oral and trans-cutaneous approaches are the two ways to access the defect for surgical repair with either vascularized or non-vascularized autologous bone grafts. Commonly, mandibular reconstruction is necessary after a traumatic injury or surgical resection due to benign tumors of the jaw or malignant oral cavity neoplasms. Chronic infections and pathologic fractures resulting from osteonecrosis can also necessitate the reconstruction of the mandible. This activity reviews the evaluation and repair of the mandible and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating mandibular defects.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different anatomical regions of the mandible and surgical options for their reconstruction.
- Review the surgical equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique required for free tissue transfer in mandible reconstruction. 
- Outline the potential complications and clinical significance of mandible reconstruction.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care and communication to advance mandible reconstruction and improve outcomes.
