Intravenous midazolam is used for the induction of anesthesia and also in the management of acute seizures. Because of its water-soluble nature, midazolam has a rapid onset of action and can be used to manage status epilepticus when intravenous administration of other medications is not feasible. Midazolam can be used for anxiolysis and hypnosis during the maintenance phase of general anesthesia. Midazolam is an adjunct medication to regional and local anesthesia for a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and has greater patient and clinician acceptance. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of midazolam, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients where it is of clinical value.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of midazolam.
- Describe the various indications where midazolam can be effective.
- Review the adverse event profile of midazolam.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use midazolam to improve patient outcomes in the varied scenarios where it can be effective.
