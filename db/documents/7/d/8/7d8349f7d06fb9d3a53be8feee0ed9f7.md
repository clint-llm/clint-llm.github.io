The pancreas has an essential role in the digestion, absorption, and metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Damage to the cells producing pancreatic enzymes leads to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which is a serious problem leading to malnutrition, complications, and poor quality of life. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of the exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and highlights interprofessional team members' role in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
- Review the treatment options available for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and improve outcomes.
