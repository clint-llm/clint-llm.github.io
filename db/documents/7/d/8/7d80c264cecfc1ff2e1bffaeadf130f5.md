Treatment of the nutritional or toxic optic neuropathy is based on the cause. Nutritional supplements will need to be given in cases of nutritional optic neuropathy. If the supplement cannot be absorbed in an oral form, then it may have to be administered parentally.Â Medications causing optic nerve toxicity should be discontinued unless the benefits of continuing the medication outway the risk of further optic nerve damage. The specialist prescribing the medication should be consulted to provide recommendations for alternate therapies. Patients should be encouraged to limit or discontinue the use of alcohol and tobacco products to reduce the risk of worsening optic neuropathy.
