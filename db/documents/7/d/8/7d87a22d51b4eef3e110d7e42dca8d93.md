Patients with left heart failure may present with complaints of shortness of breath (often on exertion, a sensitivity of 89%), orthopnea (a specificity of 89%), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and/or symptoms of volume overload (e.g., leg swelling, weight gain, increased abdominal girth, or right upper quadrant pain due to liver congestion).

On physical exam, the most common signs encountered are:

- Rales on lung auscultation indicative of pulmonary edema

- Decreased breath sounds on lung auscultation suggestive of pleural effusion

- S3 gallop on heart auscultation indicative of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure

- Point of maximal impulse displaced laterally on palpation characteristic of increased heart size

- Jugular venous distention (jugular venous pressure over 8 cm of water) indicative of elevated right atrial pressure

- Positive hepatojugular reflux (exerting manual pressure on the congested liver causing increased jugular venous pressures)

- Increased abdominal girth due to ascites

- Swelling of the scrotum

- Low blood pressure and rapid heart rate can occur in severely decompensated failure due to decreased cardiac output
