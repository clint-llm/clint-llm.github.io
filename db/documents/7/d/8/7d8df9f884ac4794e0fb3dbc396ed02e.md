Afatinib is a relatively new drug for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Although this drug can easily be administered by patients orally as once-daily dosing, close follow-up with the oncologist and/or primary care clinician (MD, DO, NP, or PA), specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists are necessary during the treatment. Pharmacists could be the best primary source for any questions or concerns by patients. They can also perform medication reconciliation, verify dosing, and should report any issues to the prescribing physician or nurse. Nurses will encounter patients at follow-up visits and document medication adherence and signs of adverse events, which they should communicate with the rest of the interprofessional healthcare team. All interprofessional team members are responsible for meticulously documenting all interactions, observations, test results, and interventions in the patient's medical record; this allows all team members to operate from the same up-to-date information.

Better communications between health care providers, patients, and pharmacists are recommended to improve patient care and build a better side effect profile for such a new drug, eventually leading to better patient care. This collaboration demonstrates the clinical benefit of an interprofessional healthcare team. [Level 5]
