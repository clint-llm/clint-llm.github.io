Proposals posit various mechanisms to explain the development of abnormal muscle bundles in a double-chambered right ventricle. They include the following:

- Increased blood flow among patients with VSD causes hypertrophy of the supraventricular crest resulting in an acquired obstruction.

- Superior displacement of the septomarginal trabecula or moderator band causes it to undergo progressive hypertrophy over time.

- Extension of a muscular shelf from the septoparietal trabeculations to the trabecular component of the right ventricular apex in conjunction with other acquired factors results in the formation of obstructive muscle bundles.
