No discreet peripheral nerves directly stimulate the prefrontal cortex. Instead, the PFC receives and sends connections to many cortical, subcortical, and brainstem regions via fasciculi (bundles of axons which serve a similar function). Large association bundles, e.g., the superior and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi, as well as the cingulum and uncinate fasciculi, form reciprocal connections between the PFC and primary sensory and motor cortices and their association areas.
