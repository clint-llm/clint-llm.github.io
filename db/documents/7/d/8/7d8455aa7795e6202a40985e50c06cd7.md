Sometimes, it is difficult to differentiate between pituitary dysfunction and hypothalamic dysfunction. Depending on the patient's condition, certain diseases can mimic the signs and symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction:

- In hormonal deficiencies, the differential diagnosis includes pituitary gland lesions as well as the target organ involved (central hypothyroidism due to hypothalamic or anterior pituitary dysfunction vs. thyroid gland dysfunction).

- In electrolyte imbalances, such as hypernatremia due to diabetes insipidus, causes include central diabetes insipidus (due to lack of ADH production and secretion by the hypothalamus) vs. nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (due to ADH resistance or ADH receptor malfunction in the collecting duct of the kidneys).

- Increased appetite can result from genetic abnormalities causing hypothalamic dysfunction, as seen in Prader-Willi syndrome, or can be due to other conditions such as hyperthyroidism.

- Sleep disorders may be caused by a deficiency in hypothalamic hormones such as orexin/hypocretin or melanin-concentrating hormone.
