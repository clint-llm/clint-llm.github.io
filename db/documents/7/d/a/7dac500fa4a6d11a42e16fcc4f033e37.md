The acquired aortic stenosis manifests with exertional dyspnea, syncope, angina, and, ultimately, heart failure. pulsus parvus et tardus, is an expected finding in severe aortic stenosis and, when present, is specific to aortic stenosis. On auscultation, the second heart sound may lack a split and can be heard as a single sound during inspiration. It can also become paradoxical when the closure of the aortic valve gets delayed than the pulmonic valve. A mid-systolic ejection murmur, heard best over the right second intercostal space, with radiation into the right neck. However, high-frequency components may radiate to the apex in calcified aortic valves, and this phenomenon is called the Gallavardin phenomenon. The murmur becomes softer in LV failure and when there is a fall of stroke volume.
