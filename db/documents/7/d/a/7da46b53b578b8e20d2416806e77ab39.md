No specific tests diagnose this condition. History and physical are key to making the diagnosis. Some studies that may help rule in or out this condition include:

- Chemistry Panel - Assess electrolytes which can cause peripheral neuropathies.

- Diabetes Testing - Diabetic neuropathy can have a similar presentation.

- Thiamine, Folate, and Vitamin-B12 Testing - Key nutrients in neuronal formation in both peripheral and central nervous systems.

- Heavy Metal Toxicities - Can commonly cause neuropathy in the extremities.

- HIV and Syphilis - Both diseases can have neuropathy in advanced presentations.

- Nerve Conduction Tests - Nerve conduction velocities are generally normal or mildly slow in early presentations and slowed in demyelinating conditions.

- Needle Electromyography (EMG) - Commonly seen with alcohol neuropathy and include positive sharp waves and/or fibrillation potentials and complex repetitive discharges.
