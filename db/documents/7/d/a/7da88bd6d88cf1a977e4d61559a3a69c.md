The immunological investigation of a patient with neutropenia includes the assessment of immunoglobulins, complement system, and phagocytes.

**Quantitative Serum Immunoglobulins**

- IgG

- IgM

- IgA

- IgE

**Blood Lymphocyte Subpopulations**

- B lymphocytes (CD19 and CD20)

**Phagocytic Function**

Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test (before and after stimulation with endotoxin)

- Unstimulated

- Stimulated

Neutrophil mobility

- In medium alone

- In presence of chemoattractant

**Complement System Evaluation**

Measurement of individuals components by immunoprecipitation tests, ELISA, or Western blotting

- C3 serum levels

- C4 serum levels

Hemolytic assays

- CH50

Complement system functional studies

- Classical pathway assay (using IgM on a microtiter plate)

- Alternative pathway assay (using LPS on a microtiter plate)

- Mannose pathway assay (using mannose on a microtiter plate)

**Microbiological studies**

- Blood culture

- Urine culture

- Stool culture

- Sputum culture

- Cerebrospinal fluid (culture, chemistry, and histopathology)

**Other investigations of immunodeficiency disorders**

- Complete blood cell count

- Bone marrow biopsy

- Histopathological studies

- Blood chemistry

- Tumoral markers

- Levels of cytokines (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor)

- Chest x-ray

- DiagnosticÂ ultrasound

- CT scan

- Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

- DNA testing (for most congenital disorders)
