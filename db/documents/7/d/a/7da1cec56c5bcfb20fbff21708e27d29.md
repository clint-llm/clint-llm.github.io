Depending upon the severity and type, errors of refraction are often characterized by intermittent or sustained periods of 'blur' resulting from a defocus of visual targets.

With repetitive exertion, fatigue of the ciliary muscles usually develops.

This group of individuals at risk excludes presbyopes and those with organic causes, like autonomic degenerative diseases. These are related to other comorbid factors (such as age-related crystalline nuclear sclerosis and neurological involvement).

Individuals with visual tasks that require prolonged and repetitive stimulation at the near point of accommodation can often develop symptoms of chronic fatigue consistent with AI.

AI may also occur as a side effect of exposure to therapeutic doses of pharmacological agents, which include parasympatholytics (such as hyoscine and atropine) and sympathomimetic agents.
