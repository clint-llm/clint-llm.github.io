Diaphragmatic injuries are rare but morbid complications of traumas, occurring in 0.8% to 15% of all thoracoabdominal traumas. Up to 10% to 15% of penetrating traumas may involve the diaphragm, whereas only around 1.6% of thoracoabdominal blunt traumas will lead to diaphragmatic injuries. Gunshot wounds, when compared with stab wounds, have a higher incidence of diaphragmatic injury and eventual herniation. Despite its rarity, traumas with sufficient energy to damage or rupture the diaphragm will frequently cause injuries to adjacent organs, contributing to up to 20% mortality unrelated to the diaphragm injury itself. As a result, higher mortality is commonly seen inÂ blunt diaphragm injuries when compared to penetrating injuries. In those cases where immediate diaphragmatic injuries are not recognized, significant morbidity may be realized several years after onset.
