Ritonavir contraindications include patients with a known allergic reaction to either ritonavir or any of its components. Hypersensitivity reactions include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

There is a boxed warning for drug-drug interactions of ritonavir leading to potentially serious and/or life-threatening reactions when co-administered with drugs such as antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine), sedative-hypnotics (triazolam, orally administered midazolam), HMG-COA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin) or an ergot alkaloid (dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovine). Healthcare providers should review medications taken by patients before prescribing ritonavir or when prescribing other drugs to patients already taking ritonavir. It also has significant drug interaction when taken with alfuzosin, ranolazine, voriconazole, colchicine, lurasidone, pimozide, cisapride, lomitapide, or sildenafil (for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension).

Ritonavir is contraindicated with potent CYP3A inducers (e.g., apalutamide, St. John's wort), which can significantly reduce ritonavir plasma concentrations and may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response, possible resistance, and cross-resistance.
