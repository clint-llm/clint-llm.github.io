PAM should be suspected in patients with meningoencephalitis or meningitis when a recent history of freshwater exposure is present. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can be similar to that in bacterial meningitis with glucose being low to normal, elevated proteins, and polymorphonuclear cells (predominant leukocytosis). CSF pressures are elevated, and pressures of up to 600 mm H20 have been reported in patients with PAM.

Identification of N. fowleri can be missed on gram stains and cultures as the fixation procedure destroys them. Visualization can be achieved on wet mounts, hematoxylin,Â and eosin (H and E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Giemsa-Wright staining, or modified trichrome stains.Naegleria fowleri. Antigen detection by immunohistochemical staining techniques can be performed on CSF or tissue sample, along with PCR and cultures.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can range from being unremarkable earlier in the process to findings of diffuse hemorrhages or infarctions with contrast enhancement in the gray matter.
