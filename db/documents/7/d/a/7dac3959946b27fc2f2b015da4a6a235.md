Pseudoappendicitis can describe any condition mimicking appendicitis, a disease which classically presents with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain with anorexia and tenderness at McBurney's point. The more specific definition of pseudoappendicitis is associated with Yersinia enterocolitica infections such as the inflammatory intestinal condition known as yersiniosis. Most cases of Y. enterocolitica, however, are asymptomatic and self-limiting. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of pseudoappendicitis and summarizes the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe patient history clues that might lead to consideration of pseudoappendicitis.
- Explain how pseudoappendicitis is diagnosed. 
- Explain how to properly manage a patient affected by pseudoappendicitis.
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of pseudoappendicitis and subsequently improve the evaluation, enhancing detection of pathology and allowing for treatment when indicated.
