After TPK, the patient should be managed initially with hourly topical 0.2% linezolid and 1% azithromycin 6 to 8 times per day and then slowly tapered based on the clinical response. The additional postoperative adjuvant topical drugs include 1% homatropine two times per day to reduce pain due to ciliary spasm, 0.5% timolol eye drops two times per day to prevent secondary glaucoma, and low dose topical antibiotics like 0.5% moxifloxacin or 0.5% gatifloxacin 4 times per day to prevent secondary bacterial infection for at least 2 weeks. If the patient is culture positive for Pythium and postoperatively button culture is also positive for Pythium, steroids can be started after 3 weeks of keratoplasty, making sure there are no residual Pythium hyphae.

Moreover, if the patient is culture-positive and button culture is negative, steroids can be started after 2 weeks of anti-Pythium drugs. The steroids in the form of 0.1% prednisolone or 0.1 % dexamethasone should be started 4 times per day for 2 months and then 3, 2, and 1 time for 3 months each. The steroid dose can be altered based on the clinical response. The vital part of rehabilitation is good postoperative counseling and regular follow-up. The patient should be told about the need for optical penetrating keratoplasty in the future once the eye is free of infection.
