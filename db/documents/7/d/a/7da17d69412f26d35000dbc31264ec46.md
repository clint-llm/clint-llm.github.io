**Patient Safety**

I-123 is relatively safe as a gamma emitter except in pregnant patients and nursing mothers. The effective dose equivalent for a 3.7 MBq (100 ÂµCi) I-123 RAIU is estimated at 0.74 mSv (74 mrem).

**Patient Education**

I-123 is a radioisotope of iodine used for a thyroid uptake scan. By measuring the amount of radiotracer uptake, the RAIU study is able to identify the activity of the overall thyroid gland. In conjunction with clinical symptoms, blood work, and other imaging findings (such as ultrasound), and I-123 RAIU, or RAIU and thyroid scan, can create a better picture of the thyroid pathology and help provide a diagnosis.
