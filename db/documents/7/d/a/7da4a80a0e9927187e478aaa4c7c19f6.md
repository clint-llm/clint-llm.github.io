The evidence for treatment of LMDF is limited to case series and retrospective reviews and should be considered even though the disease course is usually self-limited. This disease tends to be poorly responsive to topical or systemic therapies that are first-line for granulomatous rosacea. The efficacy of oral tetracyclines is poor, whereas the response to isotretinoin is mixed.
