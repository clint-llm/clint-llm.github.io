The consultations vary depending on the systems and organs affected. There should be proper follow-ups with a dermatologist for the skin lesions and a pediatric orthopedic surgeon to provide adequate help and treatment for any musculoskeletal abnormalities. Any organ abnormalities such as the heart or the central nervous system should have regular and appropriate follow-ups with a cardiologist and neurologist.
