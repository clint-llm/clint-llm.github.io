In most parts of the United States, the highest incidence of tick bites occurs during spring and summer. Patients may present to the primary care clinic, urgent care, or emergency department with an attached tick. All clinicians should know how to manage ticks. In some geographical regions, prophylactic antibiotics may be considered due to a high incidence of tick-related disease. The interprofessional team may consider an infectious disease consultation to determine what if any, type of treatment is needed after tick removal. Patients with tick bites require education regarding the potential complications and disease transmission. The pharmacist should ensure medication compliance if a systemic infection is being treated. If noncompliance is a concern, the clinical team should be contacted.
