Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis, and neuronal loss. The course may be relapsing-remitting or progressive in nature. Lesions in the CNS occur at different times and in different CNS locations. Because of this, multiple sclerosis lesions are sometimes said to be "disseminated in time and space." The clinical course of the disease is quite variable, ranging from stable chronic disease to a rapidly evolving and debilitating illness. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of MS and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis.
- Describe the typical presentations of multiple sclerosis.
- Summarize the workup of a patient suspected of having multiple sclerosis.
- Review the need for enhanced coordination of care among interprofessional teams to improve outcomes for patients affected by multiple sclerosis.
