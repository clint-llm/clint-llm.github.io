Histological examination of a Zenker diverticulum is rarely done. Microscopic evaluation of the pouch usually shows a sac containing stratified squamous epithelium, and the submucosa lining often shows fibrous tissue. Rarely, ulcerations or evidence of cancer, squamous cell or carcinoma in situ, may be present.
