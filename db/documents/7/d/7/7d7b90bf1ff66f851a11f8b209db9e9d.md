Testing procedures for POCT vary based on the specific manufacturer, test, and sample type. For accurate results in most POCT units, setting up and calibratingÂ the specific test before use properly is essential. Following the manufacturer's instructions for use (MIFU) or package insert for each POCT apparatus is crucial in achieving accurate testing.

**General POCT Testing Procedures**

- A sample is obtained for analysis. This could be a drop of blood for blood glucose concentration via a glucometer or urine for beta-hCG. Various requirements regarding the patient's state, the specimen's state, and the preparation needed for accurate testing exist. This is discussed in further detail in both the "Specimen Requirements and Procedures" and "Quality Control and Lab Safety" sections.

- The sample is applied to the POCT device. Immediately before this step, a reagent may facilitate accurate testing. For example, some POCT units for COVID-19 require samples obtained via nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs to be placed in a reagent solution to facilitate the transfer of antigen into the solution.

- Once the test is performed, the result is obtained and can be directly transferred to the patient's electronic medical records (EMR) if the POCT device is integrated or interfaced with the EMR system.
