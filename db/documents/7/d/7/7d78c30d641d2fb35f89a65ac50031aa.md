There are 3 pathological stages of Loeffler endocarditis.

- Stage 1: Acute endo-myocardial inflammation/necrosis (first 1 to 2 months) that results in eosinophilic infiltration with degranulation and release of toxic proteins.

- Stage 2: Thrombotic stage (after about 10 months) that results in endothelial damage and thrombus formation. May cause valve motion restriction

- Stage 3: Fibrotic stage (after 1 to 2 years) where the thrombi areÂ replaced by fibrosis. The endomyocardium, valves, and chordae tendineae may be involved. This stage may be associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy and valve incompetence.
