Patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis secondary to chronic alcohol use should be encouraged to avoid alcohol (and to stop smoking, if applicable). Follow up should take place within 1 to 2 months.

A low-fat diet with high protein and carbohydrates is recommended for patients with steatorrhea. The fat intake should be less than 20g/day or less. However, this can lead to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins and thus, oral supplements are necessary.
