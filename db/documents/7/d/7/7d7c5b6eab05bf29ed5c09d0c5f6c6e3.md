RTT is an X-linked dominant condition with lethal consequences in hemizygous males. Mutations in MECP2 are found in the majority of classic RTT cases; recent studies found 2 additional genes, cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) and forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) involved in the pathogenesis of RTT. The spectrum of mutation types includes missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. MECP2 or early truncating mutations are responsible for a more severe phenotype in comparison to missense mutations, whereas C-terminal deletions are associated with milder phenotypes. The R133C mutation is generally associated with a milder variant of RTT often with preserved speech. The MECP2 protein is responsible for 2 main functioning roles: the methyl-binding domain, which specifically binds to the methylated CpG dinucleotides, and the transcription repression domain, which recruits repressor proteins that inhibit gene transcription. Mutations in an X-linked gene CDKL5 have been reported in patients with a seizure variant of RTT. It is important to note that there isÂ a wide spectrum of mutations associated with disease severity and close to 30 different types mutations can cause RTT.
