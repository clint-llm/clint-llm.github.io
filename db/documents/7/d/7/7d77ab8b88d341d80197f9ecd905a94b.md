Generally speaking, surgery for breast cancer is a low-risk procedure.  However, a multitude of complications can occur for both lumpectomy and/or mastectomy. In a lumpectomy, positive margins requiring re-excision or mastectomy may occur. Additionally, both procedures may lead to a seroma, hematoma, infection, or skin necrosis.  Injury to surrounding blood vessels, including the axillary vein, may occur. Nerve injury or transection may also occur, leading to sensory or motor defects. An additional complication includes lymphedema, which may occur particularly in the setting of complete axillary node dissection.
