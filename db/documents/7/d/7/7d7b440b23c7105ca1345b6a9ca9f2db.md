The performance of the technique begins with the positioning of the patient. The patient should be placed in a position of comfort with the patient lying down on one side. Depending on practitioner comfort, the posterior spinous process may be positioned close to or far from the table (the patient either laying on the side with the spinous process posterior or anterior given the diagnosed rotation).

The goal will be to rotate the patient against the pathologic rotation of the diagnosis (also known as the restrictive barrier), and so the practitioner can push or pull on the patientâ€™s pelvis and thorax for the desired rotation (practitioner preference as above). For example, a patient is evaluated and found to have L3 Flexed Rotated and Sidebent (L3 FRS right) right (the L3 vertebra has rotated to the right relative to L4). The goal is to manually rotate the L3 vertebra to the left to correct the dysfunction as HVLA is a direct technique (acts in a direction to counteract the dysfunction).
