Once a clinical diagnosis has been established after a thorough history and physical exam, the initial investigation is for the identification of the causative organism. The most sensitive and specificÂ test is the nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for the most common organisms, chlamydia, and Neisseria. NAAT can be performed on endocervical, vaginal fluid, or urine samples.

In the case of concurrent vaginal infection, testing for trichomonas, and bacterial vaginosis (BV) should be done. Saline microscopy, amine whiff test, and vaginal pH are performed for BV, whereas NAAT is the preferred test for trichomonas.
