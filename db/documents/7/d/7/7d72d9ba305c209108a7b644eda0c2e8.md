The pattern electroretinogram (PERG) response can be either transient or steady-state, depending on the stimulus. The standard, transient PERG, is recorded in response to low contrast-reversal frequency stimuli (1-2 Hz), whereas the steady-state PERG is seen with a higher reversal frequency (8 Hz). Since the steady-state PERG does not allow for direct measurements of individual waveform components, it can be harder to interpret and requires appropriate knowledge and software to evaluate the recordings.  High frequency steady-state recordings negate some of the effects of poor fixation on the recording, increasing intertest reproducibility and steady-state PERG has been optimized for the early detection of glaucoma.

The standard, transient response separates the PERG into wave components, including a negative wave at about 35 msec (N35) followed by a positive wave at approximately 50 msec (P50) and a large, negative wave at around 95 msec (N95).

**Waveform Components**

P50

The P50-wave is the initial positive deflection originating from RGCs as well as from outer retinal photoreceptor cells, namely the macular cones. This wave-component is largely a measure of outer retinal function.

N95

The N95-wave is the negative deflection following the P50-wave that originates from the inner retina. This wave-component reflects the RGC function.

**Waveform Analysis (Figure 1)**

Amplitude

The amplitude is the maximal light-induced electrical response (voltage) generated by the various retinal cells. PERGs can be analyzed according to the amplitudes and implicit times of the wave components. The P50 amplitude is calculated from the trough of N35 to the peak of P50. The N95 amplitude is calculated from the peak of P50 to the trough of N95. In turn, N95 amplitude includes the P50 amplitude, and P50 includes that of N35. If the N35 is poorly defined, the P50 amplitude is calculated from the average baseline, which is between time zero and the onset of P50 to its peak.

Implicit Time

Implicit time (time-to-peak) refers to the time needed for the electrical response to reach maximum amplitude. Implicit time is calculated from stimulus onset to the peak of the corresponding wave-component and reflects the rate of signal conduction.

Latency

Latency is the period from stimulus onset to response onset, as opposed to the peak of the response (i.e., implicit time).

The N95 to P50-Wave Ratio

The ratio of the N95- to P50-wave amplitudes provides an index of inner to outer retinal function.

**Protocols**

The PERG response has a small amplitude and differs depending on the technique used. The ISCEV standards for generating the PERG response and for minimizing variability between procedures, thus enabling data to be compared among laboratories. ISCEV defines the following clinical protocols for PERG stimulus parameters and recording:

**Field and Check Size**

The standard PERG stimulus is a black and white reversing checkerboard. The check size for the standard PERG is a width of 0.8 degrees (± 0.2) for each individual square check (± 5% error). While a square stimulus field is not required, the aspect ratio between the width and the height of the stimulus field should be from 4:3 to 1:1. The mean width and height of the stimulus field should be 15 degrees (± 3).

**Luminance**

The PERG response is complicated to elicit given a low stimulus luminance. A photopic luminance higher than 80 cd/m is required for the white areas of the stimulus. Mean stimulus luminance must be constant with no transient changes in luminance during checkerboard reversals.

**Contrast**

The contrast between black and white square checks should be close to 100% and no less than 80%.

**Background Illumination**

Background illumination beyond the checkerboard stimulus and typically involves using dim or ordinary room lighting. For all recordings, ambient lighting should be the same bright lights should be kept out of a subject’s direct view.

**Data Display System**

Traditionally the stimulus for PERG has been displayed on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor. Liquid crystal display (LCD) and light-emitting diode (LED) displays can have a flash artifact when the pattern reverses, which complicates the recorded response and no longer generates a PERG but rather a hybrid flash electroretinogram coupled with a PERG. This is hard to interpret as the waveform components no longer correspond to the anatomical areas listed above and thus should be avoided. It should be ensured that if LCD or LED displays are used, it is devoid of a flash artifact.

**Reversal Rate**

The reversal rate of 4.0 ± 0.8 reversals per second (rps) should be used when recording the standard PERG response.

**Recording**

At least 100 artifact-free sweeps should be acquired and averaged. However, more sweeps will be needed under circumstances when the PERG response is small, undetectable, or collected with significant background noise. Two trials for each stimulus condition must be acquired to confirm standard PERG reproducibility. Superimposing PERG responses can help to evaluate the quality and reproducibility of recordings.

**Averaging and Signal Analysis**

Given the small amplitude of the PERG response, signal averaging is required. The analysis period or sweep time should be at least 150 ms with a stimulation rate of 4 rps and 250 ms intervals between reversals.

**Artifact Rejection**

The limit for computerized rejection should be no higher than ± 100 microvolts.

**Sampling Rate**

A sampling rate minimum of 1,000 Hz (i.e., 1 ms per point) is recommended.
