Electron microscopy is not routine for the examination of peripheral blood smears. However, a study from 1965 comparing supravital staining (light microscopy) and electron microscopy of peripheral blood from rodents with induced lead/phenylhydrazine toxicity or post-phlebotomy anemia noted that the structure and general appearance of stippled material in reticulocytes was consistent with ribosomes.
