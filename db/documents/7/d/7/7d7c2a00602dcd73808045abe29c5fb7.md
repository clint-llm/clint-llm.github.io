Common forms of soft tissue radionecrosis are central nervous system (CNS) radionecrosis (cerebral and myelitis of spinal cord), radiation cystitis with hemorrhage, radiation proctitis, vaginal radionecrosis and laryngeal radionecrosis. The morbidity for these patients is substantial with 50% of the patients having complications if future surgery is needed in the radiated field. Annually there are 6000 to 30,000 patients annually developing this condition in the United States. Radiation cystitis with hemorrhage can be improved in about 80% of the patients with resolution or significant reduction of the hematuria. Of the patients with resolution, the recurrence rate is about 0.12 patients per year.
