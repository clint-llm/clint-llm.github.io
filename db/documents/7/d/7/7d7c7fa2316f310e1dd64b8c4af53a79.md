Ectodermal dysplasias (EDs) are a group of cutaneous genetic disorders that are extremely rare. Provider education at the primary level is of utmost importance to diagnose this condition as early as possible. Interpersonal communication between the pediatrician, dermatologist, dentist, and other providers may be required as various body organs are affected. Parents must be well informed about the condition and day-to-day routine management to prevent any complications from developing in such patients.
