Vocal cord paralysis refers to the immobility of a vocal cord, which can be due to pathology of the vocal ford (also known as the vocal fold) itself, or of the verve that supplies the muscles creating vocal cord motion. While the term "paralysis" describes true immobility, this term is erroneously frequently used interchangeably with "paresis," which is a weakened motion of the vocal cord. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of vocal cord paralysis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various etiologies of bilateral vocal cord paralysis.
- Describe the evaluation of bilateral vocal cord paralysis.
