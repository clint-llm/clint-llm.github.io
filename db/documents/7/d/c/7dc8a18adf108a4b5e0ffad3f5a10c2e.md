High doses of cimetidine (over 5 g/day) can cause reversible impotence or gynecomastia.

Patients receiving treatment with drugs metabolized through the cytochrome P450 enzymatic pathway may experience enhanced drug effects resulting from pharmacokinetic interaction when treated concomitantly with cimetidine, as it is a well-known enzyme inhibitor of several CYP isoforms, including 1A2, 2C9, 2D6, 3A4 P450 isoforms. Clinically relevant is the inhibition of cytochrome 3A4 and 1A2.

The interaction involving beta-blockers (metoprolol or propranolol) results in significant sinus bradycardia and hypotension.

Drug interactions are notÂ observed clinically with other H2-blockers, including ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine. Cimetidine raises the pH of the gastric contents. This increased pH may lead to decreased absorption of drugs that require a lower pH to dissolve or increased absorption of drugs with absorption reduced by acid inactivation in the stomach.

Impairment of vitamin B12 absorption raises the possibility that long-term, full-dose therapy with cimetidine may produce B12 deficiency similar to that observed in other hypochlorhydric states.

There is a low incidence of cimetidine-induced hepatitis, suggesting a hypersensitivity-type reaction.
