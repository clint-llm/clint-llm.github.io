Thymic aplasia and congenital hypoparathyroidism can be seen in:

- CHARGE syndrome

- Chromosome anomalies on 4q21.3, 10p13-14, 11q23-ter

- Maternal diabetes or retinoic acid exposure

Other syndromes that may be considered include Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Kabuki syndrome, and Goldenhar syndrome.

Due to the subtle and varied phenotype of velocardial facial syndrome, it is important to keep it on the differentialÂ diagnosis in any patient with congenital anomalies, learning difficulties, and immune deficiencies.
