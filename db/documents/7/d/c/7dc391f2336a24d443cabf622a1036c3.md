Flumazenil has some associations with the precipitation of seizures in patients with benzodiazepine dependency with a history of seizures. However, Flumazenil overdose is extremely rare.

**Clinical Features**

- Anxiety

- Agitation

- Increased muscle tone

- Hyperesthesia

- Seizures

**Management**

- There is no precise antidote for flumazenil toxicity

- In mild to severe toxicity, symptomatic and supportive treatment should be a consideration.

- An overdose of flumazenil in a patient who is not a chronic benzodiazepine user would not be expected. Chronic benzodiazepines users experience withdrawal with abrupt discontinuation of the drug.

Consult criteria:

- Contact a medical toxicologist or local poison center for any patient with suspected severe adverse effects after receiving flumazenil, such as seizures, dysrhythmias, and hypotension.

- It is important to note that seizures after flumazenil administration are significantly associated with exposure to a pro-convulsant drug.
