Certain precautions are to be taken for breast screening considering the age of a woman. New guidelines by the American College of Physicians suggest that it is cautioned that beginning at the age of 40, average-risk women with no symptoms should discuss with their physician regarding benefits, personal preferences, and potential harms of breast cancer screening with mammography before the age of 50.

Clinical breast examinations screening is not recommended no matter what age for average-risk women. The screening for those aged 75 years or older or with a life expectancy of 10 years or less should stop.
