B2 agonists are mostly given in inhaled forms-whether as a spray or nebulized to limit the systemic adverse effects and reduce the delivered dose to target only the respiratory system. They can also be given intravenously or intramuscularly in severe acute exacerbations of asthma, orally in cases of using LABAs or ULABAs in the long-term management of asthma or COPD, and subcutaneously.
