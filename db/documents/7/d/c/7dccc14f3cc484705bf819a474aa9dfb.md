Thallium is a tasteless, odorless, and water-soluble chemical element for which both accidental intoxication and criminal poisoning have been reported. The occupational exposure limit for thallium is 0.1 milligrams (mg) per cubic meter of skin for no longer than eight hours a day. Levels of 15 mg per cubic meter and above are considered acutely dangerous. Thallium is readily absorbed both via inhalation and via skin. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients with thallium toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of thallium toxicity.
- Describe the typical history and physical exam findings in patients with thallium toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment of thallium toxicity.
- Explain modalities to enhance care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by thallium toxicity.
