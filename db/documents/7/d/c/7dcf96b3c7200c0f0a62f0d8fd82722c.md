# Continuing Education Activity

Hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure is a condition characterized by inappropriate secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), secondary to a phosphocalcic metabolic disorder. Surgical management represents the only radical treatment of the disease and its indications are well established. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of surgery in case of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- Review the management options available for secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

# Introduction

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by parathyroid glands and plays a role in calcium and skeletal metabolism.

Prolonged SHPT is often associated with disturbances of bone turnover, as well as visceral and vascular calcifications, which are responsible for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Despite improvements in medical treatment, surgical treatment of SHPT is often necessary, especially in refractory cases.

# Etiology

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is commonly associated with vitamin D deficiency and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

# Epidemiology

The most common causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism are vitamin D deficiency and chronic kidney disease.

# Pathophysiology

Hypocalcemia is the most important stimulus for increased secretion of PTH from parathyroid glands in SHPT. The increased stimulation also results in parathyroid hyperplasia. Increased PTH level results in increased calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut. PTH acts as a stimulus for increased osteoclast activity, which results in calcium and phosphorus resorption from the bone.

Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is secreted by osteocytes and plays an important role in phosphorus homeostasis by increasing phosphorus clearance in the renal tubules.

In chronic kidney disease, decreasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) leads to increased secretion of PTH. Decreasing GFR leads to decreased phosphate clearance and hyperphosphatemia, which then stimulates the parathyroid glands to secrete PTH.

# Histopathology

In chronic renal failure, there is an increase in the ability of parathyroid cells to synthesize and secrete hormone, which is responsible for an increase in serum PTH concentration at first. This results in hyperplasia of the gland linked to both cell hypertrophy and increased cell proliferation, which is still potentially inhibited by therapeutic measures. As renal function deteriorates, the expression of calcium, vitamin D, and FGF23 receptors gradually decreases in the parathyroid gland, which leads to parathyroid gland hyperplasia.

Parathyroid hyperplasia is classified into four categories: diffuse hyperplasia, diffuse and multinodular hyperplasia, multinodular hyperplasia, and the simple nodular hyperplasia.

Renal osteodystrophy comprises a group of bone mineral disorders. There are five types based on histological classification.

Mild disease is a state of slightly increased bone remodeling and usually seen in early or treated SHPT.

Osteitis fibrosa cystica is a state of high bone turnover from increased osteoclast activity and bone destruction and resorption caused by the high PTH levels.

Osteomalacia is the softening of the bone due to inadequate osteoid or insufficient mineralization of the osteoid, depending upon the rate of bone remodeling. The problems with mineralization arise due to abnormal calcium and phosphorus metabolism.

Mixed disease has features of both osteomalacia and osteitis fibrosa and is associated with aluminum deposition

Administration and overuse of vitamin D analogs, calcimimetics, and phosphate binders decrease PTH levels, which, in turn, leads to a state of low bone turnover with normal mineralization known as adynamic bone disease.

# History and Physical

In SHPT, the disorder of phosphocalcic metabolism will affect the different systems of the body and manifests by specific clinical signs. Primarily bone, and then soft tissues are affected. Skin can also be affected.

In SHPT, bone remodeling and mineralization are affected.

Extraosseous manifestations are also seen. Calcifications affect the arterial walls, viscera, periarticular tissue, cutaneous tissue, and the eye (cornea and conjunctiva). They are thus responsible for muscle weakness, red-eye syndrome, and intense pruritus.

Calciphylaxis can be seen as ulceration of the skin, resulting from arterial obstruction, with cutaneous necrosis of the extremities.

Other manifestations in SHPT include psychological and neurological problems, as well as malnutrition.

# Evaluation

Evaluation in SHPT consists of monitoring the lab values of PTH, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D levels, and renal function.

Since it can present as bone mineral disorder and affect the musculoskeletal system, Kidney Disease for Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2017 recommends systematically performing bone mineral density in dialysis patients with bone mineralization disorders to assess the risk of pathological fracture.

There are certain striking radiological features in renal osteodystrophy. Osteosclerosis is increased bone density, especially in the axial skeleton, but bone is structurally weak and prone to stress fractures.

The brown tumor in SHPT is a lytic bone lesion caused by increased osteoclastic activity and proliferation of fibroblasts.

Osteitis fibrosa cystica is revealed on standard radiographs by subperiosteal resorption, especially at the distal phalanges, clavicles, distal ulna, and skull.

Periarticular, vascular, and more rarely, visceral metastatic calcifications can also be found.

# Treatment / Management

**Medical Treatment**

Management of SHPT targets abnormal phosphocalcic metabolism. Maintaining the serum calcium and phosphorus levels within the normal range along with control of PTH and vitamin D levels is the key in management of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The U.S. National Kidney Foundation (NKF) proposed the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines and established targets for biomarkers (calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels) to lower SHPT related mortality.

Phosphate binders, vitamin D, and calcimimetics have been reported in the management of calcium and phosphate levels in patients with CKD. In addition, patients are advised to restrict dietary intake of phosphorus by limiting phosphate-rich foods such as soda beverages, meat, cheese, and dietary products.

Phosphate binders include aluminum hydroxide, sevelamer hydrochloride, sevelamer carbonate, and lanthanum carbonate.

Vitamin D metabolites include cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol, which is vitamin D2. Vitamin D analogs such as calcitriol, paricalcitol, alfacalcidol, and doxercalciferol are grouped under vitamin D receptor activators (VDRA) based on their site of action. Vitamin D could have a possible survival benefit in CKD patients.

Calcimimetics are agents that increase the sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR) in the parathyroid gland and lead to decreased PTH production. Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic drug that is commercially available and extensively used in dialysis patients. Etelcalcitide is another calcimimetic. Important side effects of calcimimetics include nausea, hypocalcemia, QT prolongation, arrhythmias, worsening heart failure, and convulsions.

**Surgical Treatment**

Parathyroidectomy is a surgical modality available if medical therapy is unsuccessful or refractory. Other indications include calciphylaxis, refractory pruritus, severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium greater than 10.2 mg/dL) or hyperphosphatemia (serum phosphorus greater than 5.5 mg/dL), anemia hyporesponsive to erythropoietin, PTH levels more than 800 pg/mL (for more than 6 months despite medical therapy) and extraskeletal calcification.

Surgical techniques include subtotal parathyroidectomy and total parathyroidectomy with or without autotransplantation.

An interesting postoperative complication of surgery is the hungry bone syndrome where the lack of osteoclastic activity causes decreased PTH, leading to hypocalcemia.

# Differential Diagnosis

Primary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism are always in the differential of secondary hyperparathyroidism. In primary hyperparathyroidism, there is increased secretion of PTH, which leads to increased calcium and phosphate levels.

# Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials

In patients on hemodialysis, Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) has shown increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with calcium level greater than 10 mg/dL, phosphorus level greater than 7 mg/dL, and PTH level greater than 600 pg/ml.

Evaluation of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Outcomes (EVOLVE) study is the largest, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in dialysis patients with SHPT. This study showed that cinacalcet therapy did not offer survival benefit or improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients on hemodialysis.

In the ADVANCE study, cinacalcet with low dose vitamin D analogs as compared to flexible vitamin D dosing showed a positive trend in decreasing vascular calcification, although the study was inconclusive.

OPTIMA study is a multicenter, open-label study that looked into cinacalcet based treatment algorithms being compared with conventional therapy in dialysis patients showed an increase in the achievement of KDOQI targets.

Observational studies have shown that parathyroidectomy is beneficial in dialysis patients as it can lead to normalization of calcium and phosphorus, reduced fracture rate, improved health-related quality of life, and decreased all-cause mortality.

# Prognosis

Secondary hyperparathyroidism can have a significant impact on life due to complications such as bone and mineral disorders, cardiovascular complications, and calciphylaxis. Quality of life can be affected by symptoms such as muscle pain, bone pain, and fractures in extreme cases. Although medical therapy has been aimed to achieve target levels per Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, there is not much clinical evidence from prospective studies suggesting an improvement in survival due to vitamin D analogs or calcimimetics.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is common among patients with vitamin D deficiency and chronic kidney disease. Since about half of the world population is vitamin D deficient, and about 1/7 have CKD, it is important to understand the condition in depth. Calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D metabolism are affected in secondary hyperparathyroidism. This leads to several bone-mineralization disorders, renal osteodystrophy, and calcifications in extraosseous sites, including coronary calcifications that can lead to devastating cardiovascular outcomes and increased mortality. Thus, it is important to detect this disorder early and start therapy. Medical treatments include vitamin D analogs, calcimimetics, and phosphate binders to restore calcium, phosphorus, and the PTH levels within normal range. Early consultation with nephrologists is important to manage the outcomes. Surgery is the last option if patients do not respond to appropriate medical treatments.
