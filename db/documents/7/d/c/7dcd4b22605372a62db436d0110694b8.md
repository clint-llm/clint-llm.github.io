Serious adverse events may result from unrecognized clinical deterioration; thus, an interprofessional team approach is necessary for diagnosis and management.

The patient's primary caregivers (which can include nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians) must utilize the early warning scoring system, the patient’s heart rate and trends, and any historical and physical exam features to help identify and recognize any life-threatening causes early.

Interprofessional teamwork, communication, and collaboration are key to identify the presence of tachycardia and ensure patient safety.  [Level 5]
