Differential diagnoses include the following

- Post-stroke depression: This is a mood disorder. Patients have a persistent sad mood and negative thought content. Such patients may have a history of depression.

- Aphasia: This is a language disorder. Patients appear to be well with normal mood and behavior. They attempt to communicate but with difficulty. They socialize appropriately.

- Parkinson's disease: This is a movement disorder. Patients exhibit rigidity, tremors, slowness of movement, and difficulty in walking. Cognitive and behavioral problems occur at a later stage of the disease.

- The condition may be confused with the psychomotor retardation of depression and is sometimes labeled "pseudo-depression." It is important to differentiate abulia from depression as antidepressants are not effective in abulia.

- Catatonia: In mild cases, it can be difficult to differentiate this condition from abulia.
