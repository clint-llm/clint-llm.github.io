Methods to evaluate procedural skills will be different than those used in clinical clerkships where simulation is most commonly used as a teaching modality.

A training checklist can determine if the learner appropriately prepares for and executes a task by checking off whether they independently and correctly perform the specified exercise. Given that procedures are likely to have sequential steps, checklists are appropriate for assessing technical skills. Checklists allow for a thorough, structured, and objective assessment of the modular skills for a procedure.

Alternatively, the global rating scale allows a rater to evaluate the degree (on a 1 to 5 scale) to which a learner performs all steps in a given assessment exercise. Paired together, the checklist and the global rating scale is an influential assessment tool for procedural skills assessment.
