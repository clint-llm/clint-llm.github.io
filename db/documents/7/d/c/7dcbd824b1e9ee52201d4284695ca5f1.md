Per DSM-5 criteria, a diagnosis of a histrionic personality disorder requires a pervasive and ubiquitous pattern of consistent attention-seeking behaviors and emotional dysregulation as outlined by specific manifestations. Diagnosis requires meeting **five****(or more)**of the following criteria:

- Uncomfortable when not the center of attention

- Seductive or provocative behavior

- Shifting and shallow emotions

- Uses appearance to draw attention

- Impressionistic and vague speech

- Dramatic or exaggerated emotions

- Suggestible (easily influenced by others)

- Considers relationships more intimate than they are

These patients take repression and dissociation as a significant form of defense mechanism.
