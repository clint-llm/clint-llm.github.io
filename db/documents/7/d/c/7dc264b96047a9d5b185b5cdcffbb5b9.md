Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors involving the central nervous system (CNS). Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are the hallmark feature of NF2 and present in approximately 90 to 95 percent of patients. Meningiomas are seen in approximately 50 percent of patients with NF2. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of NF2 and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neurofibromatosis type 2.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with neurofibromatosis type 2.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for neurofibromatosis type 2.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 2 and improve patient outcomes.
