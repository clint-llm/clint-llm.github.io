The branchial arches are embryologic structures that develop into anatomic structures in the adult human. The term “branchial” derives from the Latin “branchia,” meaning gills, and is used to describe the development of many species of fish and amphibia. Therefore, the term “branchial arches” is alternatively named “pharyngeal arches” to more accurately describe human anatomy. The branchial arches give rise to the lower face, neck, and part of the upper thorax, while the frontonasal prominence gives rise to the forehead and nose. The adult structures formed by the branchial arches are the result of contributions from the primary germ layers, including endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm, and neural crest cell derivatives. Failure of the branchial arches to correctly develop results in anatomical, developmental defects manifesting in many ways that will be detailed further below.
