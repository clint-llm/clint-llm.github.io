When evaluating for somatostatinoma, a blood level of somatostatin-like-immunoreactivity (SLI) is necessary to make the diagnosis. While an elevated plasma SLI can increase your suspicion, it is essential to rule out other illness that also elevates SLI, such as medullary thyroid cancer, lung cancer, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma.

When considering the many NETs that are treatable with synthetic somatostatin analogs, increased plasma levels of the hormone associated with the particular tumor (i.e., insulin for insulinoma, VIP for VIPoma, etc.), along with the clinical picture, will confirm the diagnosis. It is then up to the physician to determine whether the patient is a surgical candidate or requires treatment with somatostatin analog.
