The knowledge and identification of these risk factors are important not only in the early recognition and treatment of DVTs but also in the prevention of initial and subsequent DVTs. The presence or absence of these risk factors can guide the use of prophylactic measures such as prophylactic anticoagulation therapy in hospitalized patients. Further, identifying inherited risk factors can be crucial to using appropriate long-term anticoagulation therapy when indicated to prevent future DVTs and complications of DVTs such as PEs.
