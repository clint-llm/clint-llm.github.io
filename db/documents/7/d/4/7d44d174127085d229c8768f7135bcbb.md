Preparation for blood transfusion involves running pretransfusion testing for compatibility between recipient antibodies and donor red blood cells. This involves obtaining a sample of the recipient’s blood to send for a type and screen. The type and screen test verifies the recipient’s blood type and also determines if the recipient has any “unexpected” (non-ABO) antibodies that might cause a reaction. There are multiple methods for running this screen. If the screen is negative, it is very unlikely there will be a reaction. Obtaining blood for the patient should be done rapidly if required. If the screen is positive, many blood banks will crossmatch and hold two units of blood for the patient in case they need a transfusion. Another prerequisite to blood transfusion is to take consent from the patient if possible.

The following is the list of important steps to follow before proceeding with blood transfusion:

**Find Current Type and Crossmatch**

- Take a blood sample, which lasts up to 72 hours

- Send the sample to the blood bank

- Ensure that the blood sample has the correct labeling with the date and timing

- Wait for the blood bank to crossmatch and prepare the needed units

**Obtain Informed Consent and Health History**

- Discuss the procedure with the patient

- Confirm the past medical history and any allergies

- The supervising provider should have obtained signed consent from the patient

**Obtain Large-bore Intravenous Access**

- This is 18 gauge or larger IV access

- Each unit should be transfused within 2-4 hours

- A second IV access should be secured in case the patient needs additional IV medications

- Normal saline is the only fluid that can be administered with blood products

**Assemble Supplies**

- Y tubing with an in-line filter

- 0.9% NaCl solution

- Blood warmer

**Obtain Baseline Vital Signs**

- These include heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, pulse oximeter, and respiratory rate

- Respiratory sounds and urine output should also be documented

- Notify the provider if the temperature is more than 100 F

**Obtain Blood from the Blood Bank**

- Once the blood bank notifies that the blood is ready, its delivery from the blood bank should be ensured

- Packed red blood cells can only be given one unit at a time

- Once the blood has been released for the patient, there are 20-30 minutes to begin the transfusion and up to four hours to complete it.
