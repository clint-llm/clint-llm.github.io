**Contraindications**

Patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to phenazopyridine should not receive the drug. In addition, it is contraindicated in severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate less than 50 mL/min). It is now also contraindicated in patients with severe hepatitis.

**Precautions**

Patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are at greater risk of hemolysis and should not receive phenazopyridine.

**Carcinogenicity**

Rats fed phenazopyridine developed liver and colorectal tumors, both malignant and benign. There has been no association between phenazopyridine use in humans and carcinogenicity.

**Interactions**

Phenazopyridine has no known drug-drug or drug-food interactions. The drug is also a dye, so it is expected to interfere with urinalysis tests that use a color reaction or spectrometry.Â  Theoretically, there is an increased risk of methemoglobinemia occurring when phenazopyridine is combined with a local anesthetic (benzocaine and others). Such a risk is not substantiated in the medical literature, and the drug has been used successfully with lidocaine gel.
