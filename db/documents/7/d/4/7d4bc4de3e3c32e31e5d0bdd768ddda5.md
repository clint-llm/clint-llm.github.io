FXS is indirectly the result of the expansion of the cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) triplet repeat within the Fragile X mental retardation one gene (FMR1) located on the X chromosome.FMR1 expression resulting in an abolished or greatly diminished expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).FMRP is a "master regulator"FMRP is the direct cause of FXS. Without FMRP, there is increased excitation of the neurons and diminished activity of GABA, which helps explain many symptoms of FXS, including seizures.

Testing for PM carriers (by an FMR1 DNA test) allows for genetic counseling. Prenatal testing for FXS is an option often provided to women with a premutation or a full mutation. The expanded CGG triplets in the 5’-untranslated region of FMR1 are hypermethylated, resulting in a decreased expression of FMRP. Therefore, the methylation status of CGG triplets is a key factor for categorizing FXS; in other words, the greater the degree of methylation, the greater the deficit of FMRP. FMRP protein is expressed throughout the body, with specifically increased concentrations in the brain and the testes.
