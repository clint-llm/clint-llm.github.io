The most commonly reported side effect associated with repaglinide monotherapy is hypoglycemia (7% in a study of 76 patients), followed by weight gain (1.8 kg / 16 weeks). Whipple triad for hypoglycemia is defined as the presence of symptoms of hypoglycemia, presence of factual hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dl), and correction of the symptoms after administration of glucose.

Repaglinide has reports showing it to be of greater risk of cardiovascular events than metformin but lesser than sulfonylureas.

Other adverse reactions of note included upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis when trialed versus placebo. There are reports of weight gain, diarrhea, and joint pain.

Reports of hypoglycemia are more frequent when repaglinide is used in combination with metformin, while studies suggest an increased risk of peripheral edema if used in combination with a thiazolidinedione.
