Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are often managed in the emergency room without a neurological consultation. However, a neurology consult is warranted for patients with status epilepticus, diagnosis of epilepsy, and a prolonged postictal state. A pharmacist consultation is appropriate for patients who prescribed antiepileptics in the setting of polypharmacy. A close followup with the primary care physician is needed to monitor for recurrence if the initial workup is negative. Mental health professions should also be involved in the care of patients for counseling and managing psychiatric disorders. Specialty trained nurses in emergency and neuroscience are monitor patients, administer medications, and communicate with the physicians. Pharmacists work with patients and their families to improve compliance and review potential side effects, as well as checking for drug interactions, and alerting the prescriber to any red flags. With interprofessional teamwork, patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures can experience better outcomes. [Level 5]
