The incidence of subglottic stenosis is reported as less than 4% in the 1980s studies and 0.6% in studies published after the 1990s. The decrease in the incidence is because of the improved handling of neonates who require ventilator support.Â The current incidence of subglottic stenosis is between 0% to 2%.
