A thyroglossal duct cyst is an embryologic remnant that forms due to the failure of closure of the thyroglossal duct extending from the foramen cecum in the tongue to the thyroid’s location in the neck. The thyroid begins to develop in the third week of gestation as a median outgrowth from the primitive pharynx. The thyroid primordium originates at the foramen cecum at the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior one-third of the tongue. From there, the thyroid descends to the neck, passing anterior and in close relation to the developing hyoid bone. It reaches its final position in the inferior pre-tracheal neck by the seventh week of gestation.

The thyroglossal duct is the narrow tubular structure left from the thyroid’s descent and connects the thyroid gland to the foramen cecum. The distal part of the duct differentiates into the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland in about 50% of people. The thyroglossal duct normally involutes by the tenth week of gestation. If any portion of the duct persists, secretion from the epithelial lining can result in inflammation and thyroglossal duct cyst formation.
