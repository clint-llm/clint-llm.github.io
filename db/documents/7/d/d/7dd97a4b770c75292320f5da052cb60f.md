Anophthalmic socket is rarely congenital, with a prevalence of 0.2 to 0.3 per 10,000 live births. Acquired anophthalmos due to surgical interventions is much more common, and the prevalence of acquired anophthalmia following enucleation is 2.6 -5 per 100,000 population. There is no direct relationship between age and sex and the amount of contraction of the socket. The involvement of the left eye was more than the right eye for reasons unknown.
