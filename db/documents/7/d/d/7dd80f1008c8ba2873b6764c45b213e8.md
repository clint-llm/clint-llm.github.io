Leptospirosis, also called Weil disease, is the most common zoonotic infection in the world. Leptospirosis is caused by an infection with the spirochete bacterium Leptospira. It is most often spread through exposure to the urine of infected animals either from direct contact or from contact with soil or water contaminated by the urine. Common animals that transmit Leptospirosis include farm animals such as cattle, pigs, and horses but can range from wild animals such as raccoons and porcupines to domesticated dogs. This activity describes the evaluation and management of leptospirosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of leptospirosis.
- Explain the typical presentations of icteric versus anicteric leptospirosis.
- Describe the management of leptospirosis.
- Identify the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team members to optimize outcomes for patients affected by leptospirosis.
