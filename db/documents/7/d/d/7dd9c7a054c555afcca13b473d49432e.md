Specimens for CK analysis include serum and plasma heparin. Anticoagulants, other than heparin, should not be used in collection tubes because they inhibit CK activity. The collection of specimens in gel separator tubes does not appear to affect CK activity compared to tubes not containing gel.

Fresh serum, free from hemolysis, is the specimen of choice for analysis of the CK isoenzyme pattern.
