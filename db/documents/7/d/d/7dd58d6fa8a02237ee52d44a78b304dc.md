Peripheral magnetic stimulation (PMS) or so-called transcutaneous magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive method of delivering a rapidly pulsed, high-intensity magnetic field to the periphery other than the brain. Interest in the research and clinical applications has increased over the last three decades as it is considered a novel, painless, and easy approach for many neurological and musculoskeletal conditions. This activity reviews peripheral magnetic stimulation and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients on when this therapy might be considered.

**Objectives:**
- Describe peripheral magnetic stimulation as a therapeutic intervention.
- Identify the conditions in which peripheral magnetic stimulation may be considered as a treatment.
- Explain the use of peripheral magnetic stimulation in the stimulation of peripheral nerves.
- Outline peripheral magnetic stimulation and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients on when this therapy might be considered.
