There are a few normal osseous and non-osseous variants within the elbow joint, as well as some abnormal osseous variants that can cause deficits in function.

Pseudodefect of the capitellum is one of the normal osseous variants that exist.  In this variant, a groove exists in between the capitellum and the lateral epicondyle.  This groove can be seen on MRI and can sometimes be mistaken for an osteochondral defect.

The supracondylar process is a bony spur that can show up in up to 3% of individuals.  These can sometimes be mistaken for osteochondromas of the humerus.  In some cases of prominent supracondylar processes, median nerve and more rarely, brachial artery compression can occur due to a fibrous band called the ligament of Struthers which runs from the supracondylar process to the medial epicondyle.

Ligamentous variations also exist.  In several studies, four different variants of ulnar collateral ligament were identified, while 23% of the specimens studied contained an accessory ligament.

Congenital radioulnar synostosis is a rare anomaly in which the failure of segmentation results in the fusion of the radius and the ulna.  Flexion and extension are unaffected by the condition; however, supination and pronation are.  This condition may lead to consequences in the form of excessive strain on the shoulder and wrist.
