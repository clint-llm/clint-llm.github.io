One may consider a fungal culture swab, biopsy, or scraping from the scalp in patients with tinea capitis. A fungal culture may confirm the causative fungus. The scraping can be done and placed on a glass slide. A few drops of KOH 20% solution is added, and the slide is examined under a microscope to look for hyphae and spores.

Woods light is a modality to check for fluorescence of the infected areas. With the light of a wood, infected hairs by M. canis, M. audouinii, M. rivalieri, and M. ferrugineum will give a green to a yellow-green color. Infection with T. schoenleinii may show a blue color. It should be noted that tinea capitis caused by T tonsurans usually does not show fluorescence.
