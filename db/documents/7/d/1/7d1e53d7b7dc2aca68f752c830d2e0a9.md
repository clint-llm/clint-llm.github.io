The majority of patients will not present symptomatically and subsequently, have a colonoscopy that identifies colorectal polyps. Rather, polyps are found on screening or surveillance colonoscopy. If patients doÂ present with symptoms, commonly they will endorse a history of blood per rectum.

Polyps that are greater than 1 cm are more likely to cause symptoms like abdominal cramps, change in bowel habits, and rectal bleeding. Rarely a villous adenoma may induce secretory diarrhea resulting in dehydration and electrolyte deficiency.
