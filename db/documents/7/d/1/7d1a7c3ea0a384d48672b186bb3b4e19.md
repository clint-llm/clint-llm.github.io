The therapeutic benefits of radiotherapy for myxopapillary ependymomas are still debated owing to the benign and slow-growing nature of the tumor. In one study, the authors reported no difference in irradiated versus nonirradiated patients after total or subtotal resection.

According toÂ other recent studies, postoperative radiotherapy is beneficial for patients who had subtotal resection of myxopapillary ependymoma and was considered as the best treatment option for these patients because of the high risk of long-term recurrence in case of subtotal resection of the tumor.

Other studies demonstrated that radiotherapy is significantly more beneficial in the case of subtotally resected myxopapillary ependymomas smaller than 6 cm compared to larger tumors (58% versus 92% 5- and 10-year progression-free survival).
