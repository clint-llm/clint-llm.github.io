As previously mentioned, there are multiple genetically directed mechanisms for the progress of retinitis pigmentosa. Apoptosis is essentially physiologic programming for cell death, which can be triggered by a genetic mutation. Apoptosis can also be induced through cell-to-cell communication between the photoreceptors themselves.

Three clinical findings typical of retinitis pigmentosa are the presence of bone spicule pigmentation, vascular narrowing, and optic nerve pallor. The melanin pigment deposits, named for their characteristic bone spicule star shape, are due to retinal pigment epithelial cells, which detach and migrate to perivascular locations in the retina. The exact cause of this migration is not fully understood, nor is the narrowing of retinal vessels, although one suggestion is that this results from a decreased metabolic demand due to the death of large numbers of photoreceptors. Change in the appearance of the optic disc is probably due to the formation of glial cells, which cover the disc and increase reflectivity, producing a"waxy pallor."
