Turf toe is most commonly sustained as a result of forceful hyperextension of the first MTP joint. Turf toe can occur during many sports such as basketball, soccer, and gymnastics, but it is most commonly described in football, and the prevalence is far greater in athletes who play on an artificial field since it is more rigid than a natural grass field. This injury was prevalent on the astroturf (short-pile) fields of the past because it was a much less compliant surface and placed more strain on the players' feet.Â Modern (high-pile) turf behaves in a way more similar to natural turf, and the prevalence of the injury has decreased.
