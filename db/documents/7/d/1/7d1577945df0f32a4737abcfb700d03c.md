The precentral gyrus is the anatomical location of the primary motor cortex, which is responsible for controlling voluntary motor movement on the body's contralateral side. The primary motor cortex is topographically organized and creates a somatotropic map. Texts often refer to this map as the motor homunculus, or “little man.” The organization of the homunculus is in such a way that that the medial part of the paracentral lobule contains the motor control of the foot, leg, and thigh, and the precentral gyrus contains the motor control for the gluteal area, trunk, upper extremity, hand, digits, and head. The motor homunculus within the precentral gyrus is organized in such a way that trunk is more medial, the upper limb and hand are more laterally, and the far lateral regions, just superior to the lateral fissure, contain the motor control for the face and head. Regions of the motor homunculus that require more fine-tuned motor control are larger than the others. Specifically, the areas for the hand and face are disproportionally larger than others. In addition to the primary motor cortex, the precentral gyrus also contains a portion of the supplementary motor cortex, which is involved in the planning of voluntary limb movement.

The precentral gyrus is a part of the cerebral cortex and contains the neocortex. Neocortex contains six different cell layers (I-VI), which are numbered starting from the cortical surface and move inward. Layer I mainly consists of the dendrites from neurons and axons of the deeper layers. Layers II and III contain neurons that extend to other layers of the cortex, layer IV receives inputs from the thalamus, layer V consists of projections to other subcortical areas, such as the basal ganglia, brainstem, and spinal cord, and layer VI contains projections to the thalamus. Different areas of the cerebral cortex consist of varying layer thickness depending on the function of that region. The primary motor cortex consists of larger layers III and IV due to the numerous projections to the brainstem, spinal cord, and other cortical areas to control voluntary movement. The primary motor cortex does not receive a lot of sensory information from the thalamus, so there is a thinner layer IV. Giant pyramidal cells of Betz are also found within the primary motor cortex and project down to the lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord. The primary motor cortex receives afferent inputs from the premotor cortex, sensory cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. The neurons within the primary motor cortex contribute to the establishment of the corticobulbar, corticospinal, and cortico-rubrospinal tracts.
