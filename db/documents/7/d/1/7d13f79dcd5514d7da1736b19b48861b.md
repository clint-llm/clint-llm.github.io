The etiology of thoracic duct leaks can be traumatic and non-traumatic. However, trauma-related etiologiesÂ are more common.

A. Traumatic causes include surgical and non-surgical

- Surgical causes: Iatrogenic injury while performing procedures on the esophagus, aorta, pleura, lung, vagotomy, spine surgery, and others. One of the leading reasons for the damage of the thoracic duct during surgical interventions is its anatomical variation.

- Non-surgical causes: Penetrating or non-penetrating trauma to the neck, thorax, upper abdomen, and occasionally due to straining or forceful vomiting and subclavian vein canalization are among the non-surgical causes.

B. Non-traumatic can be further categorized into malignant and non-malignant etiologies.

- Malignant causes: Lymphomas and non-lymphomatous causes include primary lung cancers, mediastinal tumors, sarcomas, and leukemia.

- Non-malignant causes: It can be due to benign tumors, cirrhosis of the liver, thoracic aortic aneurysm, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, protein-losing enteropathy, tuberous sclerosis, and in developing countries, tuberculosis.

Among the above, surgical and tumors are the most frequent causes of chylothorax.
