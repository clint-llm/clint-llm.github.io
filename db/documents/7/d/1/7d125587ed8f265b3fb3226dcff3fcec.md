Angiography is performed to image the anatomical and structural details of the vascular system, including the cardiac chambers. Initially used for structural diagnosis of intravascular pathologies, angiography has been expanded to offer functional assessment and therapeutic options. This activity reviews the fundamental principles, indications, procedure technique, and complications of angiography, and also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in performing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for angiography.
- Describe the technique of angiography.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications of angiography.

- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interdisciplinary team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing angiography.
