Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum is a complex congenital disorder of craniofacial morphogenesis. It can affect multiple organ systems and requires interprofessional team management. Clinical presentation can vary from mild to severe form with complex phenotypic presentations. Ocular and facial anomalies should be addressed early to maximize the outcomes and reduce the social and educational impact. The treating specialist should utilize early consultation with all specialties. Speech therapy and training for the management of autistic disorders should be initiated early. Family screening and referral to a geneticist may be beneficial.
