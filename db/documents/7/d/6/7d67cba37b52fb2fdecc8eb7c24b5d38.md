This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation and treatment of a nucleus pulposus herniation, which is a condition characterized by a rupture of the annulus fibrosus with a displacement of the nucleus pulposus outside the intervertebral disc space causing symptoms derived from inflammation and compression of nerve roots (radiculopathy) or spinal cord (myelopathy). This condition must be promptly diagnosed to guide treatment, avoid complications, and improve outcomes. This activity helps to enhance the knowledge of evaluation and treatment of nucleus pulposus herniation, highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of nucleus pulposus herniation.
- Describe the typical presentation of patients with nucleus pulposus herniation.
- Outline the treatment of nucleus pulposus herniation.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care for patients with nucleus pulposus herniation.
