Femoral pseudoaneurysm after vascular access is a common problem and are addressable with via less invasive means than open surgery.  Pseudoaneurysms that occur at vascular anastomosis mandate open repair and revision.  Visceral pseudoaneurysms are uncommon, and diagnosis of these is often during an investigation for vague symptoms of abdominal pain, or with CTA imaging with signs of bleeding.  Aortic pseudoaneurysms are rarely spontaneous and result either from infection or trauma.
