The clinical diagnosis of adenomyosis is difficult as a variety of common gynecologic conditions share the signs and symptoms. The most common symptoms include heavy menstrual bleeding or painful menses. Clinical diagnostic accuracy is neither sensitive nor specific.

The physical exam classically demonstrates a “boggy” enlarged uterus due to the combined effects of increased vascularization from ectopic endometrial tissue and smooth muscle proliferation. As compared to the enlarged leiomyomatous uterus, a tender uterus is more common.
