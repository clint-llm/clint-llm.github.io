This drug is poorly absorbed and is low in toxicity. No serious toxicity has been reported, and a specific toxic dose has not been established. There is insufficient research verifying the efficacy or safety of using cromolyn sodium in pediatric patients less than 2-years-old.

Acute life-threatening reactions have been reported. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, patients should receive treatment with antihistamines with or without beta-agonists, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. In the case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, oxygen, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, as well as ECG monitoring, and IV fluids should be administered. No specific labs or testing are necessary unless indicated.

Management of mild to moderate toxicity is symptomatic and supportive. The clinician should correct any significant fluid and or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea. Severe toxicity is not expected following an overdose but is managed with symptomatic and supportive treatment.
