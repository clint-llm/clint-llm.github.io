Serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)) is a neurotransmitter and hormone that has been well-studied for its activity in mood regulation and other peripheral physiologic functions.

Positive regulation of libido occurs by the presence of dopamine in the synapse as well as other microcircuits at sites where the action of estrogen, norepinephrine, and testosterone take place. Negative regulation of libido occurs by microcircuits at sites where the action of serotonin and prolactin take place. This suggests that an imbalance of these microcircuits can lead to the development of HSDD, highlighting decreased amounts of DA and NE and increased amounts of 5HT.

FlibanserinÂ acts by targeting specific central serotonin postsynaptic receptors with agonistic and antagonistic effects on 5HT1A and 5HT2A, respectively.

The activity of flibanserin on 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors results in an increase of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) and a decrease of serotonin in the prefrontal cortex extracellularly.
