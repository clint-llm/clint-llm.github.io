- An MRI of the chest can differentiate between thymoma and a thymic cyst.

- The most common syndrome associated with thymomas is myasthenia gravis.

- The most accurate method of determining if a patient with myasthenia gravis can tolerate a thymectomy from a respiratory status is a negative inspiratory force (NIF). If it is -20 or less, this patient is the right candidate for surgical resection.

- Patients with myasthenia gravis should receive intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis before scheduled thymectomy. They should also be weaned off any immunosuppressants and have their corticosteroid dosages reduced to have the least amount of negative effect on wound healing.
