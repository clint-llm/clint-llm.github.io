There are only two classes of RPR interpretation: reactive or nonreactive. Occasionally, it is necessary to repeat testing or report an “indeterminate” result, which requires further evaluation.

Syphilis is a reportable STI in the United States. The demographics, sex, ethnicity, and age of each patient are recorded. The CDC receives data on reportable STIs through the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance. Certain cases may be further investigated by the local health department, and additional risk factors such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and HIV infection may be reported. In the United States, the rate of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis has significantly increased within the past 15 years. In 2001, there was a historic decline in reported cases with 2 cases per 100,000; however, the reported rate tripled in 2016 with 8.7 cases per 100,000.
