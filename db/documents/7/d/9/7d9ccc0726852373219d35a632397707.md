Testicular seminoma is a germ cell neoplasm originating from the seminiferous tubules, due to malignant transformation of primordial germ cells. The exact molecular derangements underlying this transformation are not clearly understood, but the most common genetic finding is the gain of genetic material from chromosome 12p. Some of the mutations noticed in germ cell tumors include BRAF, KIT, KRAS, NRAS, and TP53, although single-gene mutations are relatively uncommon.

Seminomas can be subdivided into one of three categories based on histology: classic, anaplastic, and spermatocytic. In testicular seminoma, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is in the normal range. If AFP is elevated and the presence of noseminomatous elements in histopathological specimens makes the diagnosis of nonseminotaous germ cell tumor. Germ cell carcinoma in situ (CIS) is a premalignant condition with the propensity of progression to seminoma or embryonal cancer. Patients with cryptorchidism, infertility, prior contralateral germ cell tumors, intersex disorders, or atrophic testes more commonly have CIS. Testicular microcalcifications observed on scrotal ultrasound were implicated in the testicular carcinoma development.
