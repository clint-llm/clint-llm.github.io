The chorda tympani nerve (branch of the facial nerve) joins the lingual nerve below the skull near the lower border of the lateral pterygoid muscle within the pterygomandibular space

Other sensory branches of the mandibular nerve are the auriculotemporal nerve, the buccal nerve, and the inferior alveolar nerve; however, the inferior alveolar nerve also gives off a small motor branch, the mylohyoid nerve.
