CTPA is the current standard of care; V/Q scan is preferred in patients where CTPA is not possible or is contraindicated. These include pregnant females, patients with renal failure, allergy to iodinated radiocontrast material, patients who cannot fit into a CT scanner, or in patients with low probability. It has 50-fold lower radiation dose exposure to breasts. A systemic review performed on 23 prospective studies concluded that among 7000 patients in whom D-dimer assessment combined with clinical probability was inconclusive, a normal perfusion scan safely excluded PE. The V/Q scan's specificity and sensitivity are 93% and 85%, respectively, using PIOPED II criteria and 97% and 80%, respectively, using PISAPED criteria, comparable to CTPA, that has specificity and sensitivity of 98% and 86%, respectively.
