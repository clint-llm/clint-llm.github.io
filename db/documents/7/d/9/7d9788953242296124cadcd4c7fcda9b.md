With a wide preliminary differential diagnosis list, evaluation should always begin with a thorough history and physical exam to focus on diagnostic considerations. In all cases, arterial blood gas is crucial to diagnose any pH imbalances. Serum electrolytes should be measured particularly sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and calcium levels as aberrations in these may lead to further complications.

Bicarbonate concentration level declines by 2 mEq/L for each decrease of 10 mmHg in the PaCO2 level in the acute setting. However, in chronic cases, the bicarbonate level decreases by 5 mEq/L for each decline of 10 mmHg in the PaCO2 level. Nevertheless, bicarbonate levels usually never decline below 12 mmHg in compensated primary respiratory alkalosis.

In hypoxic patients, it is important to calculate the A-a gradient to determine the etiology and further diagnosis. If the A-a gradient is wide, be suspicious of pulmonary embolism and appropriately investigate the patient.

A chest x-ray is important in all patients as it helps discern an anatomical or infectious cause and may rule in/out pulmonary edema. If there is a clinical reason for it, chest computed tomography (CT) can play a vital role in achieving a diagnosis

If there is appropriate clinical suspicion for neurological insult, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head may be appropriate along with lumbar puncture for white blood cell (WBC), glucose, and protein analysis.
