Mandible distraction osteogenesis is the preferred method of treatment for HFM patients but can present with challenges and complications. A systemic review by Verlinden et al.Â found a complication rate of 43.9%, with 13.9% requiring revision surgery, hospitalization, or resulting in permanent sequelae.

Mucosal and soft tissue dehiscence were seen in 1.6% to 3.1% due to the thin soft tissue overlying the hypoplastic bone.
