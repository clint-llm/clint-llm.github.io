Complications of mediastinal seminomas involve invasion and compression of nearby structures such as the heart and lungs. It can also include local metastasis to these main organs or even distant metastasis to the liver and bones. Complications of the surgical intervention on mediastinal seminoma include the risk of causing damage to the phrenic nerve, bleeding, or development of a pyothorax. The larger the seminoma, the more dangerous these complications can be. It becomes very difficult to differentiate seminoma tissue from lung parenchyma when the tumor becomes large enough to invade nearby organs. Extreme caution must be taken by the surgeon when surgical intervention is the chosen treatment modality.
