Medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common type of epilepsy that often becomes drug-resistant, requiring the need for referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center. Management of patients with pharmacoresistant MTLE is considered to be appropriate when carried out at a comprehensive level 3/4 epilepsy centers as recommended by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Epilepsy Quality Measurement Set.

Epilepsy centers are still underutilized, resulting in suboptimal management of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, including MTLE. Any patient with epilepsy who have failed a trial of two antiepileptic medication (appropriately chosen for the seizure type/epilepsy syndrome) is considered to have drug-resistant epilepsy and should receive a referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center.

Neuroscience nurses are often involved in the care of these patients, providing monitoring, family and patient education, and facilitating evaluation and communication. Pharmacists counsel patients and families about the importance of compliance and potential side effects, verify dosing/titration and consult with the prescriber regarding agent selection. These examples of interprofessional interaction can lead to improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
