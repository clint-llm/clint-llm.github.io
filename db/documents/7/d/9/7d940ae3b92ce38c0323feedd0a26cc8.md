**Diversity Education**

This section is intended primarily for health professions educators.  However, all HCPs can use it for peer and self-education.

**Diversity Education Preface**

The Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation require medical schools to promote diversity and prohibit discrimination.

However, researchers have yet to confirm whether such actions affect health outcomes. A search in PubMed for studies of health professions diversity education did not yield studies large enough to have generalizable results about the effectiveness of one educational strategy over another on health outcomes.   An intermediate step before modifying healthcare outcomes is raising HCP’s awareness of bias to modify their perceptions and behaviors; research in this area is abundant and is described below.

Valuing cultures other than one’s own involves a willingness to learn and self-reflect in an ongoing manner.  For this reason, when discussing the ability of diversity education to change persons’ perceptions and behaviors, the terms “cultural humility,” “cultural awareness,” and “cultural sensitivity” are more appropriate than “cultural competency,” as “competency” implies having attained a finite body of knowledge.

**Diversity Education Technique**

Culturally sensitive diversity education emphasizes that HCPs should consider patients in their unique individual contexts and remember that a situation may be experienced differently by different patients.  “It is (an individual’s) health views, needs, and experiences that matter when making an informed decision, not a patient's ethnicity, race, or social status.”

Recent review articles contain general guidance and practical examples for educators:

- In 2007, Smith et al. developed recommendations for curricula on health disparities and suggested that the broad goal of such curricula should be to eliminate health disparities.

- In 2016, Dogra et al. published a curriculum guide and reviewed examples of diversity education. They recommended integrating diversity education throughout the curriculum and highlighted the importance of self-reflection in learning and teaching diversity-related concepts.

- In 2020, Brottman et al. reviewed models of diversity education for trainees and/or practitioners in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, physical and occupational therapy, public health, audiology, and social work. The interventions studied ranged from 20 minutes to hundreds of hours and included immersion experiences, simulation, discussion, lecture, reflection, educational technology, case-based learning, essays, presentations, readings, and videos.  This extensive review determined insufficient evidence to recommend any particular format as a best practice for diversity education.

Despite the lack of large-scale evidence for best practices, many smaller studies focused on particular target populations or particular interventions.  There is some evidence for gains in learners’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes with multimodal, active learning formats, for example, a combination of faculty role modeling, interprofessional rounds, and Objective Structured Clinical Examinations.

When diversity education is integrated longitudinally throughout a curriculum, appointing someone to oversee all curricular modules can maximize cohesion and minimize redundancy.

Diversity education is a unique curricular topic. All healthcare team members (e.g., nurse, physician, pharmacist, social worker) at all expertise levels (from trainee to experienced practitioner) require the same skill set.  This may lend itself well to its use in interprofessional settings in which learners of different disciplines learn with and/or from each other.

**Diversity Education Pitfalls**

HCPs have made many false assumptions about the relationship between cultural variables and medical outcomes, unnecessarily reinforcing negative stereotypes.  Teaching “typical” characteristics of minority groups frequently promote stigmatization without promoting healthcare outcome improvements.  This approach makes culture a “proxy” that prevents HCPs “from noting the person behind the patient.”

Faculty preparation is essential for diversity education; well-intentioned but unprepared educators can inadvertently promote students' and patients' stereotyping.

Finally, educators should realize that they are continually teaching a curriculum, either implicitly or explicitly.   Whereas the “planned curriculum” describes what educators perceive, the “experienced curriculum” describes what students perceive.

**Diversity Education Summary**

Diversity education is not a time-bound goal; it is an ongoing journey. It should provide learners with “the opportunity to become actively engaged in fostering a level of critical awareness of the health care provider's position of power and privilege in society.”
