The most notable structure located on the medial aspect of the elbow is the cubital tunnel, through which the ulnar nerve passes. The walls creating the tunnel include the olecranon and the medial epicondyle, while the joint capsule of the elbow and the transverse and posterior bands of the medial ulnar collateral ligament form the floor, and finally the roof is comprised of the fascia of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and Osborne’s band, and referred to as Osborne's fascia. Due to its location and function, Osborne’s fascia is of significance predominantly due to its potential to compress the ulnar nerve in the elbow.
