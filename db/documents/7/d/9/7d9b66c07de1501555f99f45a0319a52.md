Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD)Â  has a diverse presentation and has many causes. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes pharmacists. Consultations for a patient suspected of a vesiculobullous disease should be directed toward a dermatologist. In a patient with a known diagnosis of linear IgA bullous disease with the suspected associated gastrointestinal disease, autoimmune disease, or malignancy, the patient should be referred to the respective specialists. In most cases, discontinuation of the offending agent will help reverse the condition, but it may take time.
