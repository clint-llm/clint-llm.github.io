While the demand for varicella-zoster immune globulin has reduced significantly, it is essential to remember that exposure to varicella and herpes zoster might still occur. Early recognition of exposure is especially important in pregnant females as there is a high risk of maternal complications due to varicella infection. The use of varicella-zoster immune globulin helps to modify disease and reduces maternal morbidity.

Similar principles also apply to immunocompromised patients and premature neonates.

An interprofessional team approach is the optimal means for administering therapy with varicella-zoster immune globulin. This interprofessional team will include all clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs)

**Outcomes**

Varicella-zoster immune globulin has minimal adverse reactions and toxicity. Studies have shown that early administration, especially in pregnant women, decreases maternal morbidity; and that exposed patients have good clinical outcomes. Additionally, varicella-zoster immune globulin prophylaxis reduced the incidence and the morbidity of varicella-zoster in preterm and in-utero exposed infants.
