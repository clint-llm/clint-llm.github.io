Peripheral nerve blocks inhibit the propagation of impulses in nerve terminals to inhibit the perception of pain by the cerebral cortex. Local anesthetics will temporarily block the transmission of pain. The onset, duration, density, and spread of the nerve block may be influenced by the type of local anesthetic given, concentration, and volume. The femoral nerve block anesthetizes the femoral nerve distribution and is utilized for anterior thigh and knee procedures. It can provide effective analgesia with less opioid intake, which consequently reduces the adverse effects from opioid consumption, and promote earlier hospital discharge. This activity describes the technique of a femoral nerve block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of a femoral nerve block.
- Review the complications of a femoral nerve block.
- Summarize the indications of a femoral nerve block.
- Outline factors affecting the performance and improvement for outcomes of peripheral nerve blocks that require collaboration from all members of the medical team.
