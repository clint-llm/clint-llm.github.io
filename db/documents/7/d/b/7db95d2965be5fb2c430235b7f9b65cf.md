Bacopa monnieri may inhibit the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which may result in increased acetylcholine levels. As a result, Bacopa could counteract the effects of anticholinergic drugs and may worsen bradycardia and exacerbate conditions such as gastrointestinal obstruction, peptic ulcer disease, pulmonary conditions such as asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or urogenital tract obstruction.

Bacopa has been shown to inhibit human cytochrome P450 enzymes which could contribute to herb-drug interactions when co-administered orally with medications metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19.Bacopa may increase thyroxine levels (T4) in mice by about 40%. It should be used cautiously (or avoided) in those with a thyroid condition or who take thyroid hormone medications.
