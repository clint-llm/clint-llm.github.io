Psoriatic arthritis shares some clinical features with other inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), reactive arthritis (ReA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). In some cases, it is difficult to make a precise diagnosis. Unlike psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis tends to be symmetrical and generally spares the DIP joints. Ankylosing spondylitis has an earlier age of onset compared to psoriatic arthritis, and sacroiliac involvement is usually symmetric rather than asymmetric. The salient features of psoriatic arthritis compared to other arthritides are shown in Table 2.
