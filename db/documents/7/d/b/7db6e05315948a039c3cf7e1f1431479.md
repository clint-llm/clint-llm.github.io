The pathophysiology of HES is not well understood. Some experts suggest that if the eosinophil count remains elevated (greater than 1500 eosinophils 10/L of peripheral blood) over 5 months, the incidence of end-organ damage increases, which may involve the heart, lungs, central nervous system, lungs, spleen, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
