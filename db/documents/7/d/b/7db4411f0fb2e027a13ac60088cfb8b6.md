One study found that clinicians initially misdiagnosed nearly half of all acanthamoeba keratitis cases as herpes simplex keratitis (HSK).

Acanthamoeba keratitis may occasionally be confused with bacterial or mycotic keratitis. Although classically associated with acanthamoeba keratitis, ring infiltrates may also present in both bacterial and mycotic keratitis.

Lastly, the multifocal stromal infiltrates of acanthamoeba keratitis may resemble the satellite infiltrates of fungal keratitis. However, AK may be distinguished from fungal keratitis on slit-lamp examination by translucent epithelial defects, perineural stromal infiltrates, and ring infiltrates. Fungal keratitis is more likely to extend beyond the cornea.

In contrast to patients infected with uncomplicated bacterial or fungal keratitis, patients with acanthamoeba keratitis are more likely to be younger and present with a longer duration of symptoms at the initial presentation.

The differential diagnosis includes:

- Contact lens associated keratitis

- Conjunctivitis

- Dry eye

- Herpes simplex virus keratitis

- Recurrent corneal erosion

- Staph marginal keratitis
