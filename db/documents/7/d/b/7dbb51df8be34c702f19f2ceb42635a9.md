Avoidance of UV damage throughout a patient's life is of the utmost importance in preventing squamous cell carcinoma. Daily application of sunscreen above 30 SPF has been shown to decrease the risk of actinic keratoses and can help to prevent squamous cell carcinoma in patients. If a clinician is concerned about a possible squamous cell carcinoma in a patient they should immediately obtain a biopsy for tissue diagnosis and structure a treatment plan based on the pathology report they receive.
