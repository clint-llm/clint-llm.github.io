Clinical suspicion of a repeat disorder is paramount for a successful diagnosis and should not be determined solely based on positive family history. This implies that any patient showing features suggestive of trinucleotide disorders could still be a 'sporadic case' and should be further evaluated with a genetic test to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.

For genetically isolating the repeat expansion, initially, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used. However, multiple shadows observed while sizing these repeats prompted the advent of small pool PCRs, which allowed for precise quantification of the frequency of repeat changes. However, disorders with CGG repeats, even today, are measured using a southern blot. The polymerases have difficulty traversing through long CG rich tracts, making southern blotting a better diagnostic test. Together these account for 99% of the clinical accuracy.
