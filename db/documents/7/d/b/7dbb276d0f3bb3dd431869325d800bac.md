Weight is among the most essential components of science and non-science daily life routines. Weight can be defined as the force exerted on a body due to gravity. The weight W of a body equals the magnitude F of the gravitational force on the body. In particular, weight and conversion are paramount for managing patient care among healthcare providers.

Two systems calculating weight are used in all healthcare settings for health management, such as medication dosing per patient body weight. Another example is weight tracking in congestive heart failure patients. First, the metric system is commonly used in US health care. It is also the only system used in many countries on all continents. It has the advantage of a decimal system in increments or the power of tenths. Hence it is widely used for ease of calculations. US medical and pharmaceutical practices adopted the metric system in the late 1800s.
