The therapy for acute pericarditis should be targeted as much as possible to the underlying etiology. It is not necessary to hospitalize patients with acute pericarditis unless they have high-risk features such as leukocytosis, fever, acute trauma, large pericardial effusion, tamponade physiology, or an immunocompromised state.

Glucocorticoids should be used for the initial treatment of acute pericarditis only in patients with contraindications to NSAIDs or for specific indications such as systemic inflammatory diseases. Systemic glucocorticoids should be slowly tapered to reduce the risk of recurrence.

Pericardiocentesis is the management of choice for cardiac tamponade. If it re-occurs, a pericardial window can be performed. In constrictive pericarditis, the treatment of choice is pericardiectomy.

Treatment of recurrent pericarditis is similar to acute pericarditis. First-line treatment is concomitant use of NSAIDs and colchicine. Systemic glucocorticoids and colchicine can be used in patients who are unable to tolerate NSAIDs. Alternative treatment options including Azathioprine, Biological agents, and Intravenous immunoglobulins should be considered in cases of refractory pericarditis.
