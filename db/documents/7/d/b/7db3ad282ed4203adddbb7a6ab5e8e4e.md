Patients with central cord syndrome are at risk for a multitude of complications, like other spinal cord injuries.

**Pulmonary**

Respiratory complications are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with spinal cord injuries.

**Cardiovascular**

Cardiovascular complications arise largely due to impaired autonomic function.

Low baseline blood pressures in acute injury are managed with fluid resuscitation. Orthostatic hypotension can be managed both with and without medications. Non-pharmacologic strategies include reducing rapid changes in posture, avoiding hot environments, and eating smaller meals to reduce postprandial cardiovascular shunting to gastrointestinal organs.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant problem in spinal cord injury patients. Due to the nature of central cord syndrome, patients are less likely to develop VTE. The incidence of VTE in spinal cord patients ranges from 12 to 100%. While most commonly occurring in the lower limbs, upper limb VTE can also occur.

Patients with central cord syndrome are usually prone to autonomic dysreflexia, a potentially life-threatening emergency that is more common in patients with spinal cord injury above the T6 level. It is an uncoordinated response of the autonomic system to heart rate and the vascular walls. This phenomenon usually occurs in the first month of the injury. Common clinical presentations include headaches, flushing, piloerection, increased blood pressure, anxiety, and nausea.

Blood pressure monitoring may be required in selective cases for the long term, even if the patient is not diagnosed as hypertensive. For blood pressure control, nitrates, hydralazine, and labetalol are used, but prescribers should avoid giving nitrates to patients taking sildenafil.

Lastly, Readdy et al. showed that cardiogenic complications appeared in 68% of patients with no relation to conservative management, surgical management, or surgical timing. Furthermore, they noted that in patients 55 years or older, there was a significant increase in complications with dopamine compared to phenylephrine (83% versus 50%, respectively).

**Neuropathic Pain**

Patients with central cord syndrome can develop neuropathic pain at the level of the injury and below the level of injury. Neuropathic pain can be caused by damage to either the spinal cord or nerve roots. It is typically described as “hot,” burning,” tingling,” “pins and needles,” “sharp,” “shooting,” or “electric.”

**Spasticity**

Spasticity can be defined as “disordered sensory-motor control resulting from an upper motor neuron lesion, presenting as intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles” and is a significant problem in spinal cord injury patients.

Common oral pharmacologic options include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists baclofen, gabapentinoids and benzodiazepines, alpha-2-adrenergic agonists tizanidine and clonidine, and peripherally acting dantrolene.

In patients with minimal response to oral medications or have contraindications to oral medications, chemodenervation with botulinum toxin or chemolysis with alcohol are alternative interventions.

Chronic Pain, Spasticity, and Autonomic Dysreflexia have been postulated to result from the loss of descending serotonergic fibers. Therefore bolstering 5-HT function and ionic plasticity may provide therapeutic benefits.

**Genitourinary**

Neurogenic bladder is another prevalent condition among patients with central cord syndrome. In central cord syndrome, the sensation of bladder fullness, sphincter function of the bladder, and motor control of the bladder are impaired. Patients experience urgency, spasms, and frequency, along with urine incontinence.

**Pressure Injury**

Pressure ulcers are formed due to the tissue damage that typically occurs at bony prominences. Approximately one-third of the patients with central cord syndrome have multiple pressure ulcers. It is usually managed by avoiding immobility, regularly examining the prone parts, applying an emollient on the part exposed to friction, using cushions, and maintaining adequate weight and nutrition.

**Additional Complications**

Traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) patients are at an increased risk of sustaining a concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI). A meta-analysis by Budisin et al. found that approximately 40 to 50% of tSCI patients were also diagnosed with a TBI. Motor vehicle collisions were more likely to cause comorbid TBI compared to falls (57.6% versus 31.6%).
