Diagnosis begins with a compatible history, known drugs, and excluding underlying liver disease. Subsequently, a high index of suspicion is required, as there are no specific tests available to diagnose DILI.

Several clinical prediction scores have also been developed to develop an objective diagnostic tool for DILI. Among them is the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment (RUCAM), which includes risk factors, course of liver enzymes, suspected offending agents, and alternative causes into the scoring system. Using the calculated “R” score, the type of liver injury can be classified, and subsequently, the likelihood of DILI can be determined.
