Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic agent in the fluoroquinolone class used to treat bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections and pneumonia. Ciprofloxacin has FDA approval to treat urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea and chancroid), skin, bone, joint infections, prostatitis, typhoid fever, gastrointestinal infections, lower respiratory tract infections, anthrax, plague, and salmonellosis. In addition, ciprofloxacin is an appropriate treatment option in patients with mixed infections or patients with predisposing factors for Gram-negative infections. This activity covers ciprofloxacin, a broad-spectrum quinolone antibiotic that members of the interprofessional team need to review its indications, coverage, contraindications, and adverse event profile to optimally manage patients' infectious diseases.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin.
- Summarize the types of infections and bacterial coverage of ciprofloxacin and where it would be effective in a target population.
- Recognize the potential adverse events associated with ciprofloxacin therapy.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with an infectious disease that would respond to ciprofloxacin therapy.
