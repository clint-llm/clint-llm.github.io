Pit and fissure sealants can be utilized as aÂ primary prevention tool when the tooth or the patient is at an increased risk of experiencing caries or as a secondary prevention method interrupting the progression of incipient caries.

The indications for placing a pit and fissure sealant are as follow:

- Pits and fissures of deciduous teeth in children when the tooth, or the patient, is at an increased risk of experiencing caries

- Pits and fissures of permanent teeth in children and adolescents when the tooth, or the patient, is at risk of experiencing caries

- Pits and fissures of permanent teeth in adults when the tooth, or the patient, is at risk of experiencing caries

- Incipient carious lesions (non-cavitated) of pits and fissures in children, adolescents, and adults

- Pit and fissures of primary and permanent teeth should be considered in children and young people with medical, physical, or intellectual disabilities, mostly when systemic health could be jeopardized by dental disease or the need for dental treatment
