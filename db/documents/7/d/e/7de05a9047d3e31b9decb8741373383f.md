Uncontrolled hypertension consumes significant healthcare resources worldwide. Knowledge about the clinical presentation, possible etiologies, evaluation, and management of renovascular hypertension is important for all healthcare professionals to improve clinical outcomes. The management of this condition necessitates an interprofessional approach to ensure timely diagnosis and management of this condition. The primary provider needs to have a high index of suspicion to pursue this diagnosis early in the course of the disease. The clinical nurse needs to ensure the patient is compliant with medical therapy for hypertension before he or she is labeled as having resistant hypertension. Patient education by a specialized nurse is equally important in incorporating lifestyle changes to treat hypertension. Pharmacists play a crucial role in ensuring proper dosing and compliance with therapy. Educating the patient on potential complications of medical therapy is equally important and requires a specialized pharmacist to pursue this task. A team of specialized providers, including aÂ primary care provider, cardiologist, nephrologist, radiologist, and vascular surgeon, may eventually be needed to properly diagnose and treat a patient with renovascular hypertension. Since medical management is as effective as surgical interventions in most cases of renovascular hypertension, it is important to focus on pharmacological therapies as first-line to treat this disorder. When all healthcare providers function as a cohesive interprofessional team, outcomes will show improvement. [Level 5]
