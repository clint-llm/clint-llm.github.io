Erythema migrans histologic findings are nonspecific, usually showing a perivascular cellular infiltrate which consists of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Rarely mast cells and neutrophils are identified. A biopsy may show eosinophilic infiltrates, which consist of a local reaction to the bite. Spirochetes may be identified using antibody-labeled or silver stains. Usually, a paucity of spirochetes is found in the tissues of those infected with Lyme disease.

**Acrodermatitis Chronica Atrophicans**

In acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, an early biopsy may show a lymphocytic dermal infiltrate, often perivascular in location, with some vascular lymphedema and telangiectasia. Plasma cells may be seen in the cellular infiltrate. Late lesions may demonstrate epidermal thinning with loss of skin appendages. In the later stages, plasma cells may be the only feature to distinguish morphea from acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.

Fibrotic nodules may show fibrosis of the deeper dermis and hyalinization of collagen bundles. B. burgdorferi can sometimes be cultivated from the lesions.

**Borrelial Lymphocytoma**

Histologic examination is performed in patients with suspected borrelial lymphocytoma when the history is not clear enough to support a diagnosis. Borrelial lymphocytoma biopsy shows a dense dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles and pseudoterminal centers. Lymphocytes with both B- and T-cell markers, occasional macrophages, plasma cells, and eosinophils are seen.
