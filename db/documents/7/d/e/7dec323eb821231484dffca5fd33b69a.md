The human brain has a highly complex structure. It contains billions of neurons wired together through trillions of connections. Each portion of the brain has a distinct set of functions. Damage to a part of the brain results in characteristic clinical manifestations. Knowledge of neuroanatomy, functions of different parts of the brain, and clinical manifestations resulting from damage to a part of the brain are of paramount importance in the localization of a neurological lesion. Health professionals are often challenged with the complexity of this knowledge. This activity highlights the role of the physical examination in the localization of a neurological lesion and is aimed at delivering a succinct and easy to review overview of the subject.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the functions of the different parts of the brain.
- Describe the technique of performing a thorough neurological exam.
- Summarize the clinical significance of a neurological exam.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication among health professionals dealing with challenging neurologic conditions.
