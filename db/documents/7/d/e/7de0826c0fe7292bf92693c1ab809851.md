If the pancreatic adenocarcinoma is considered locally advanced then by definition it is unresectable. Neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation is typically perferred in this situation. Treatment with chemotherapy takes approximately

If the adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is located in the head of the pancreas, then the Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is the procedure of choice. If the tumor is in the body or tail of the pancreas, the distal resection is needed. Postoperatively, patients may receive chemotherapy with 5-FU, gemcitabine, and radiotherapy. If the hepatic artery is involved in the tumor, then the tumor is considered to be unresectable. However, if the superior mesenteric vein is involved in the tumor, then resection and vascular reconstruction. The same is true for portal vein involvement. It can be resected and reconstructed with graft.

If the adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is located in the body or tail of the pancreas, then the surgical procedure of choice is distal pancreatectomy with splenecotmy. If there is extensive involvement of the celiac artery and splenic artery, then a modified Appleby procedure can be performed if meets criteria

Minimally invasive approaches to Whipple and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy have been investigated with similar outcomes in survival and morbidity and mortality
