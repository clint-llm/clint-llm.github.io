The management of HaNDL syndrome requires an interprofessional team approach. Acute and severe presentation with headache and focal neurologic deficit generally require the patient to go through a series of investigations to reach this diagnosis. Patients usually present in the emergency department because of the abrupt onset of throbbing headache, along with some neurologic deficits where they usually initiate care under emergency room physicians. Later depending on the severity of the presentation, patients may get admitted to an intensive care setting under the supervision of an intensivist.

The intensivists are particularly necessary if the presentation associated with severe complications(an acute confusional state with an inability to protect airways, raised intracranial pressure) for life-saving support. Complications such as psychosis and papilledema may require the involvement of psychiatrists and regular checkups from an ophthalmologist. Continuous nursing care is requisite during an acute episode with neurologic deficits, which may take a few days to resolve. Neurology consultation is necessary due to acute onset headaches and focal neurologic deficits,  and expert guidance by a neurologist is always helpful to rule out other differentials.
