Cauliflower ear is a deformation of the ear typically caused by direct blunt trauma to the auricle and surrounding tissue. Classically experienced by wrestlers or boxers, the condition can be seen in any activity where significant shearing or impact forces are experienced by the pinna, leading to an auricular hematoma. The hematoma then elevates the auricular perichondrium from the underlying cartilage, devascularizing the cartilage. The blood accumulates in the subperichondrial space and if left untreated can lead to necrosis, infection, and loss of cartilage. Cauliflower ear is the product of the fibrocartilage and fibrosis that occurs upon the destruction of the auricular cartilage once it loses its blood supply.
