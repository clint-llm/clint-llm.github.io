Peripheral venous drainage consists of a deep system below the investing muscular fascia and a superficial system above the fascia. Communicating or perforator veins bridge the two systems, directing blood to the deep venous systems.

The lower extremity superficial venous system's main veins include the great and lesser saphenous veins. The great saphenous vein (GSV) arises from the dorsal venous pedal arch, courses anterior to the medial malleolus and medially in the lower leg, anteromedially in the thigh, and joins the common femoral vein (a deep vein) at the femoral triangle.

The lower extremity deep venous system consists of the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins in the calf.

There are approximately 150 perforator veins with one-way valves that direct blood from the superficial to the deep venous systems.

The upper limb veins have variable anatomy in regards to both number and position. The brachial vein is the predominant deep venous drainage structure. The brachial vein can be single or duplicated.

The upper extremity superficial system's main veins include the cephalic and basilic veins. The cephalic vein has an anterolateral course in the forearm before giving off the medial cubital vein, draining into theÂ axillary vein.
