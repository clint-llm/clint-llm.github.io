**G-Protein Coupled Receptors****Structure**

The largest family of human cell surface receptors are the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). They are also called seven-pass transmembrane proteins because they cross the membrane seven times. The parts of the receptor that pass through the membrane are alpha helices. As would be expected, this transmembrane protein contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids. The N-terminus is located on the extracellular side and the C-terminus of the protein is located on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Another feature that is common to most GPCRs is palmitoylation, which is the modification of cysteine residues with an acyl group. This modification targets GPCRs for cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich domains of the plasma membrane. These regions are known as lipid rafts.
