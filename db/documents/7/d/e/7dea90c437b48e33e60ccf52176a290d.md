Low back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints encounteredÂ in clinical practice. It is the leading cause of disability in the developed world and accounts for billions of dollars in healthcare costs annually. Although epidemiological studies vary, the incidence of low back pain is estimated to be anywhere between 5% to more than 30%, with a lifetime prevalence of 60% to 90%. Most occurrences of low back pain are self-limited and resolve without intervention. Approximately 50% of cases will resolve within one to two weeks. 90% of cases will resolve in six to 12 weeks. The differential for low back pain is broad and, among other diagnoses, should include lumbosacral radiculopathy. Lumbosacral radiculopathy is a term used to describe a pain syndrome caused by compression or irritation of nerve roots in the lower back. It can be caused by lumbar disc herniation, degeneration of the spinal vertebra, and narrowing of the foramen from which the nerves exit the spinal canal. Symptoms include low back pain that radiates into the lower extremities in a dermatomal pattern. Other accompanying symptoms can include numbness, weakness, and loss of reflexes, although the absence of these symptoms does not exclude a diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy.
