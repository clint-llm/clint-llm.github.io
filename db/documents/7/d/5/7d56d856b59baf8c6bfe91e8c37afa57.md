Uterine inversion is a true obstetric emergency that requires immediate treatment if the patient's life is to be saved. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team, including ICU nurses. The patient needs immediate resuscitation, patent airway, blood transfusion, and either manual or surgical management.

The outcomes for most patients are guarded.
