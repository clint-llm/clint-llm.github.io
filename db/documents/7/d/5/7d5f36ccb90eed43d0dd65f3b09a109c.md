Polygraphic electroencephalography (EEG) is a key component in the evaluation of the diagnosis. The following EEG findings are observed in MEI.

- EEG Background activity is normal

- Interictal EEG is normal most of the time.

- Ictal EEG reveals brief bursts of generalized spike-and-wave, polyspike, or polyspike-and-wave pattern, with a frequency of 3 Hz.

- EMG showing discharges corresponding to the myoclonus.

- Activation: Sleep deprivation may activate the EEG. 20% of reflex MEI have photosensitivity, and photic stimulation can activate discharges.

Neuroimaging such as MRI brain (if performed) will be normal in MEI, unlike Dravet syndrome or Lennox Gastaut syndrome.

Genetic testing may be considered to rule out specific mutations.
