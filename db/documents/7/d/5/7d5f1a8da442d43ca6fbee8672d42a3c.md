Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture represents a catastrophic emergency and if not recognized and appropriately treated, carries significant morbidity and mortality, with untreated mortality approaching 100%. Most of them rupture into the retroperitoneal cavity, causing symptoms like pain, lightheadedness and a pulsating mass in the abdomen. This activity describes the etiology, clinical features, evaluation and management of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Optimal outcomes rely on the coordinated effort of an interprofessional team that provides critical care, medical and surgical management along with swift resuscitation of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors, pathophysiology and clinical features of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- Outline the comprehensive evaluation of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- Explain the treatment options available for patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination, minimize delay to the operating room, and improve outcomes for patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.
