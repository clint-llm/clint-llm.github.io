Preoperative CT imaging is required to delineate the length and location of the tracheal lesion. A CT tracheal protocol, including inspiratory and expiratory phase, can be obtained to assess the dynamic obstruction for tracheomalacia. For neoplastic disease, CT neck and chest with contrast is needed to evaluate for locally advanced or metastatic disease.

Before surgery, patients are counseled on the risks, including hemorrhage, infection, restenosis, wound breakdown, and possible additional and future procedures – including tracheostomy. Patients should know they may be intubated and sedated for a few days, per surgeon preference, in the ICU to allow the tracheal anastomoses to heal appropriately, and their chin may be sutured to their chest to encourage continual neck flexion.

The procedure may comprise a “clean-contaminated” portion (bronchoscopy) and a sterile, open neck procedure. The mucosal surfaces and the soft tissues of the neck are ultimately connected during the procedure. Sterile preparation and draping are at the surgeon’s preference, as are the administration and choice of antibiotics.
