Diagnosis of patients with ALL/LBL is generally based on clinical, morphologic, immunophenotyping, molecular features. Molecular studies are essential for diagnosis, prognosis, classification, and treatment. The main challenge in the diagnosis of ALL is that the disease is difficult to distinguish from common, self-limited diseases of childhood. B-ALL usually presents as symptoms of bone marrow (BM) suppression by lymphoblasts. Patients can present with anemia, leucopenia or thrombocytopenia, or a combination of these. Symptoms include bruising or bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, pallor and/or fatigue due to anemia, and recurrent infections caused by neutropenia/leucopenia and/or bone pains. Patients may also frequently present with lymphadenopathy (greater than 10 mm in a single dimension of the lymph node), hepatomegaly,Â and/or splenomegaly. Patients with relapse usually present with persistent peripheral blood cytopenias. While patients with B-ALL present with symptoms that usually render an investigation work-up, B-LBL patients are usually asymptotic. B-LBL most commonly involves the skin, bone-soft tissue, and lymph nodes. Mediastinal involvement is uncommon.

The presentation of B- and T-cell LBL is different. T-LBL commonly involves the mediastinum (thymus); other possible sites include skin, tonsils, and spleen. Since T-LBL is more common than T-ALL, presentation with mediastinal masses with rapid growth is common.
