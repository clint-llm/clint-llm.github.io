Symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion has an incidence of six per 100,000, though the rate of asymptomatic chronic occlusion is unknown and may be higher. Internal carotid artery occlusion is a known risk factor for stroke in the United States. One-third of all strokes are related to carotid occlusive disease. Stroke ranks third among all causes of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer. Annually about 55,000 more women are affected, and approximately 60% of all stroke deaths occur in females. African Americans and Mexican Americans have a higher risk of stroke compared with Caucasians. Thus diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of carotid artery stenosis play a pivotal role in stroke prevention.
