Surgical replantation requires a multi-professional approach. In terms of surgery, specialist surgeon(s) would be required to perform the procedure efficiently and effectively.  During the recovery period, skilled nursing care experienced in follow-up care of patients with amputations is vital to ensure good monitoring of the replant, and allow early detection of pending complications. Early involvement of occupational hand therapists is also vital (some say the most important part) to patient recovery and the return of normal function.

Evidence generally shows good outcomes in distal amputations, especially if venous repair is possible. However, the evidence is limited in patients who do not proceed to replant.

Even after the replantation, patients often require an extensive interprofessional rehabilitation effort of nurses, occupational therapists, and physical rehabilitation physicians to regain the function of the digit.
