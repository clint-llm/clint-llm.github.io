The differential diagnoses of filum terminale and small conus myxopapillary ependymomas include:

- Fibrous meningioma:****The fibrillary variant of myxopapillary ependymomas may be confused with fibrous meningioma

- Paraganglioma: However, myxopapillary ependymomas are chromogranin-A negative and GFAP positive

- Schwannoma: The fibrillary variant of myxopapillary ependymomas may be confused with schwannoma

The epithelial and papillary variants of myxopapillary meningioma may mimic carcinoma or meningioma.

The differential diagnosis of a large myxopapillary ependymoma that is responsible for sacral destruction includes:

- Aneurysmal bone cyst

- Chondrosarcoma

- Chordoma

- Giant cell tumor

- Metastatic carcinoma:****However, myxopapillary ependymomas are devoid of cytological atypia, have a lower Ki-67 LI, and are focally fibrillar
