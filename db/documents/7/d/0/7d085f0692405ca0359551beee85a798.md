Although the pathophysiology is unclear, various theories have been postulated to describe the adrenal hemorrhage seen in WFS. From an anatomical standpoint, the adrenal gland is a vulnerable organ. There are 50-60 small adrenal branches from 3 main adrenal arteries that form a subcapsular plexus. This plexus drains into the medullary sinusoids through only a few venules. So any cause leading to an increase in the adrenal venous pressure would lead to intraglandular hemorrhage.

There is an increased synthesis of cortisol, including adrenaline, by the adrenal gland in any stressful situation. The increased serum adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) raises adrenal blood flow, which increases pressure within the vessels. This situation is further accentuated by platelet aggregation in the adrenal veins induced by adrenaline.

Other theories described to explain the hemorrhage include toxin-mediated vasculitis and coagulopathy in association with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In an experiment done by Levin and Cluff, endotoxin could induce adrenal hemorrhage only when there was an increased activity of the adrenal gland, which suggested that the increased metabolic activity associated with an increase in the production of corticosteroids was needed for the endotoxin to induce hemorrhage in the gland.
