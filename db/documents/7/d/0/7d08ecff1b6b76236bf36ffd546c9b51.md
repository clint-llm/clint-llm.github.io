There are wo different forms of brachial plexitis. One is an idiopathic form, and the other, a hereditary form. The etiology of the idiopathic form is unknown. The idiopathic form is associated with recent viral infection, specifically upper respiratory tract infection, as well as recent vaccination. Recent infection has been associated to precede the development of the disease in 25% to 55% of patients, while recent vaccination has been associated with 15% of patients. Infectious causes include smallpox, influenza, coxsackievirus, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, HIV, typhoid fever, and Borrelia burgdorferi. Other causes include strenuous exercise, pregnancy, and post-surgical plexopathy. The hereditary form is an autosomal dominant recurrent brachial plexitis. Researchers think it is due to a mutation causing a deficiency in proteins from the septin family.
