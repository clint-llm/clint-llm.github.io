If a neonate suffered from IUGR as a consequence of placental insufficiency and survives the perinatal period, they are at higher risk compared to a non-growth restricted neonate for developing cognitive deficits in childhood, including cerebral palsy and seizure disorders. Patients who suffer from placental insufficiency often have abnormal umbilical artery doppler flow velocity waveforms (DFVWs), and when one study compared DFVWs of infants who experienced placental insufficiency in-utero versus those infants who did not, they found that the infants who had had abnormal DFVWs also had lower IQs when they were 5-years-old. There is also evidence that suffering from IUGR as an infant predisposes to chronic illness as an adult, including increased risk for developing coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes.

In order to lead to a better prognosis for the neonate, the priority should be to focus on interventions that allow for maximizing gestational age at birth. It is estimated that for each week pregnancy is prolonged for fetuses between 24- and 28-weeks gestation, survival without associated sequelae is increased by approximately 10% to 15%.
