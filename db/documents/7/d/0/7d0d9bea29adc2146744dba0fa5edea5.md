**Indomethacin**

A complete response to indomethacin is one of the pathognomonic features of hemicrania continua. Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reversibly inhibits prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, similar to ibuprofen and naproxen. It is proposed that indomethacin is more effective than other NSAIDs, probably due to the highest central nervous system penetration, central serotonergic effects, and inhibition of nitrous oxide-dependent vasodilation.

Indomethacin is started at a low dose of 25 mg three times a day with meals and titrated slowly depending upon the response. Patients usually respond within 24 hours, but some may take up to a week.

**Other Non-invasive Treatments**

If a patient cannot tolerate indomethacin due to side effects, other non-invasive treatment options should be tried. These include melatonin, topiramate, COX-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib and celecoxib), gabapentin, corticosteroids, lamotrigine, lithium, amitriptyline, valproate, and naproxen. These drugs are not as effective as indomethacin in HC treatment, but they should be tried before interventional options are considered. Melatonin has a structure similar to indomethacin and can also be used in combination with indomethacin to lower the former’s dose to prevent side effects.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique utilized for the treatment of HC. Although available data is limited, a positive response has been reported in some studies.

**Invasive Treatments**

Botulinum toxin-A is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment for chronic migraines. Many clinicians also consider it for HC treatment when non-invasive treatment fails or cannot be tolerated.

Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS), like botulinum toxin, is primarily used for resistant cases of chronic migraine. It is currently being investigated for the treatment of HC with varying results.

Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) blockade is another invasive treatment for the management of HC. SPG cuts the parasympathetic outflow of the trigeminal nerve, an important pathophysiologic response in patients with HC.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is another invasive method that may be used to treat medically refractory TAC, including HC. The posterior hypothalamus is the target in these patients.
