Ensure that all equipment is at the bedside and that the US machine is equipped with an appropriate probe for the joint evaluation. Typically, arthrocentesis will be performed with a high-frequency linear probe, but there are circumstances where a curvilinear probe (low frequency) may be preferable. The advantage of a high-frequency linear transducer is that the high frequency provides greater resolution and detail of the surrounding soft tissue. However, when deeper tissue penetration is required, or a wide-needle approach is needed, a low-frequency curvilinear probe is acceptable.

Patient positioning is variable based on the joint being aspirated and is often technique-dependent. Therefore, it may be helpful to administer analgesics and/or anxiolytics before beginning the arthrocentesis procedure.  After all, the equipment has been gathered for the procedure, and the clinician should sterilize the joint of interest with betadine or chlorhexidine.  Once the site of arthrocentesis has been sterilized and draped, a sterile probe cover with sterile gel should be used to maintain the sterility of the procedure.
