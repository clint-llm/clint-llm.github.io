Even though rare, renal artery thrombosis is life-threatening,Â and it is frequently misdiagnosed.

Secondarily, as stated, thrombolysis may be indicated should the thrombotic burden be determined through imaging to be significant. Kidney function testing, underlying comorbidities, and imaging results should guide therapeutic management. The main concern is to prevent renal infarction and potential sequela. Surgical intervention should be pursued in the setting of significant blunt abdominal trauma, and hemodynamic instability should the context be appropriate.

Chronic anticoagulation post-diagnosis in patients with atrial fibrillation, a history of coagulopathy, and the presence of mechanical heart valves is important to consider for the prevention of future events.
