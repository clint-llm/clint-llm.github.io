Patients with minor bleeding are managed conservatively, and a single dose of anticoagulation is skipped or delayed.

Activated oral charcoal could also be considered if the ingestion occurred within 1 to 2 hours of presentation.

**Andexanet alfa**is an antidote for rivaroxaban. Andexanet alfa is a modified human factor Xa decoy protein. It binds and sequesters factor Xa inhibitors and has a half-life of approximately 1 hour.

**Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)**is a mixture of 3 or 4 coagulation factors and can be used off-label to reverse NOACs.

Both PCC and andexanet alfa have the potential to cause thrombosis, which provides the rationale for only using it in cases of severe or life-threatening bleeding. Although some PCC products may also contain coagulation inhibitors such as heparin, antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and protein Z to mitigate thrombotic risk.

**Resumption of the drug after bleeding**:Â In patients experiencing major bleeding, a careful reassessment of the risks and benefits of reinitiating anticoagulation is necessary.
