Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) generally have a narrow therapeutic index and, therefore, are prone to induce toxicity if intentional overdose occurs. They have demonstrated higher rates of death per one million prescriptions when compared to other antidepressants due to higher rates of suicide by deliberate overdose.

Overdose symptoms include ECG abnormalities such as QTc prolongation and widened QRS complex, hypotension, seizures, tremors, coma, xerostomia, urinary retention, and respiratory depression.

TCAs should not be used concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to the risk of developing serotonin syndrome.
