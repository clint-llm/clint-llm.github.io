Ommaya reservoir consists of an indwelling ventricular catheter with a dome-shaped collapsible silicone reservoir port positioned under the scalp. The distal end of the catheter is surgically positioned into the ipsilateral anterior horn with the proximal end connected to the reservoir.

The prerequisite knowledge and skill required for this procedure is an extension of a frontal ventriculostomy procedure. A frontal ventriculostomy is one of the most common neurosurgical procedures. The target of an ideal ventriculostomy is at the center of the anterior horn. Kocher described the entry point for the ventriculostomy as "2.5 cm to 3 cm from the median line and 3 cm anterior to the precentral fissure."
