Pemphigus foliaceus is best managed by an interprofessional team including pharmacists. Patients respond to corticosteroids but some may require more potent immunosuppressives. The pharmacist should educate the patient about compliance and potential adverse effects. For those who remain compliant, the outlook is good. Without treatment, the condition can lead to poor quality of life.
