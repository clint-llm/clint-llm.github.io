At 9 weeks of intrauterine life, fetal finger buds can be seen through transvaginal sonography. Once polydactyly is detected, the clinician should be alert to evaluate for further anomaly screening. A thorough ultrasound evaluation should be done to image the heart, kidneys, nervous system, and limbs for identification of syndromes such as trisomy 13, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Fanconi anemia, etc. For the diagnosis of isolated polydactyly, a follow-up ultrasound between 17 and 34 weeks should be done with a biometric profile.

After birth, radiographic investigations should be carried out once the infant is confirmed to have polydactyly to evaluate for bony elements in the extra digit. Before surgery, radiologic findings are needed to see the accurate anatomy of the extra digits and what type of surgery is required. Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs should provide adequate information for treatment purposes.
