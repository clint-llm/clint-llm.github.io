By understanding the biochemical pathways of the urea cycle, healthcare professionals can progress their knowledge and clinical approach in recognizing the source of elevated ammonia and decreased urea in patients with a possible urea cycle enzyme deficiency. With early detection of a urea cycle deficiency, patients, which are often newborns and infants, can be diverted from possible neurologic sequelae. In patients with a presumed urea cycle deficiency, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency should be at the top of the differential diagnoses.
