Differential diagnosis of amniotic bands divides into two main groups.

- Uterus and placental anomalies:

- Synechiae and septa - Uterine synechiae are intrauterine adhesions typically resulting at previous intrauterine surgical site or infection. Uterine septa are congenital malformations. Synechiae and septa do not restrict fetal movement and are not associated with fetal anomalies like ABS.

- Residual gestational sac - A residual gestational sac left after the death of the fetus in case of twin pregnancy.

- Circumvallate placenta - Circumvallate placenta refers to a placenta with an unusually small chorionic plate, but with the growth of extrachorial placental tissue, which also does not restrict fetal movement and not cause ABS.

2. Limb Amputations - there are other causes of congenital absence of limbs:

- Syndromes and teratogens - There are numerous syndromes with associated congenital limb anomalies. An example is absent thumb and radius syndrome. Some of the limb anomalies could also be due to teratogenic substances.
