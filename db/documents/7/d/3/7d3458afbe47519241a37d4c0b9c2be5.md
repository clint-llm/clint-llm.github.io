Since the advent of advanced cardiac imaging, such as coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance angiography, the incidence of coronary artery anomalies in the population has increased dramatically. It is suggested that important coronary artery anomalies are present in 1,300,000 of the U.S. population and are one of the main causes of sudden cardiac death. In the past, the incidence has generally been reported as 1%, but in a recent prospective angiographic study of 1950 cases, it is determined that the true incidence is around 5.6%.
