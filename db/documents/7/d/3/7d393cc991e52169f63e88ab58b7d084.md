Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the most common infections worldwide, and it is the leading global cause of gastritis. Nonetheless, recent studies have shown its prevalence is declining in the developed world.H. pylori infection correlates with acute gastritis, which may present as epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, or minimal dyspeptic symptoms.

Autoimmune gastritis symptoms vary throughout the disease, and patients with this disease do not have a higher risk of developing gastric or duodenal ulcers in comparison with acute gastritis.

Pernicious anemia can arise as a late complication of autoimmune gastritis, which normally precedes the former by at least 10 to 20 years.
