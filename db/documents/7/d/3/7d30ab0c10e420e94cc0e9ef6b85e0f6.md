A D&C is an invasive procedure with obvious risks and benefits for pregnant and nonpregnant patients. These must be made transparent in an informed consent process that allows the patient to ask questions about all alternative options and associated issues.Â Understanding these risks does not diminish the rate of complications but allows the patient and physician to engage in shared decision-making.

Elective abortion is controversial; providers and staff must be aware of potential legal implications and discuss any ethical dilemmas they may face. These discussions should be held well in advance of any patient care, and no one should be asked to participate in any patient encounter if they are uncomfortable with the care being provided. This is where clear and effective interprofessional communication and collaboration in D&C cases are essential to improve patient outcomes and benefit the healthcare team members. [Level 5]
