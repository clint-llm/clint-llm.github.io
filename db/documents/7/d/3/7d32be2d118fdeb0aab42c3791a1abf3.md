DCS is bubble formation, growth, and elimination caused by a reduction in ambient pressure that results in inert gasses, usually nitrogen, that are dissolved in solution within tissues of the body. Individuals that breathe air in a pressurized environment reach a state of equilibrium/saturation of gas. This dissolved gas will be driven out of solution when leaving a higher-pressure environment to a lower pressure environment, such as ascending from depth during self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving, leaving a caisson worksite, or ascending to altitude in an unpressured aircraft. There are individual factors identified as possibly contributing to an increased risk of DCS. These include dehydration, patent foramen ovale,
