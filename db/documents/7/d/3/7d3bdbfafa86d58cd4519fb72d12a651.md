The hook of hamate injuries are mainly due to repeated impact, usually, a sporting activity (racket, club, bat) exerting a direct force against the hamate.

The body of the hamate fracture is a consequence of a direct blow over the hypothenar eminence or a considerably strongÂ dorsopalmar compression.
