Cough is a natural defense mechanism that allows clearance of bronchial tree secretions and the elimination of inhaled foreign particles. It is a common respiratory symptom for diseases that are either apparent or covert and can produce significant suffering for patients and a diagnostic dilemma for physicians. An acute cough that is caused by a known cause is dealt with by managing the underlying cause. Here, the discussion will focus only on cough as the only symptom without a clear presence of an etiology. This could be either a subacute (4-8 weeks) or a chronic cough (> 8 weeks). For a sub-acute cough, if it is an extension of a known cause, then it needs to be dealt with accordingly. If the cause is not apparent, then it is managed as a chronic cough.
