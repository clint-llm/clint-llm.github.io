Healthcare workers who prescribe calcium channel blockers should be familiar with their adverse effects. Both hypotension and bradycardia can occur in patients on calcium channel blockers and require immediate attention. Thus, patients on these agents require monitoring as long as they remain on the drugs. If side effects do occur, the patient's treatment depends on symptoms. All symptomatic patients with hypotension or bradycardia should go to the emergency department. In asymptomatic patients, the drug should be withheld, and dosage changes or an alternative medication may be required. In an ICU setting, nurses should know how to manage hypotension and bradycardia.
