When the thumb is placed in extreme abduction or extreme hyperextension, there is a risk of injury to the ulnar collateral ligament, which stabilizes the base of the thumb at the first metacarpophalangeal joint. In one specific group, skiers, this injury is more frequently observed since individuals can fall and strike their thumb on a fixed ski pole.  Hence the synonymous term of skiers' thumb.

Laxity at the first metacarpophalangeal joint (thumb base) on abduction stress testing is suggestive of ulnar collateral ligament injury. Providers should compare to the contralateral unaffected thumb for a baseline reference point.

As with most other musculoskeletal injuries, fractures should be ruled out with standard plain films, but typically imaging modalities are of limited utility acutely in this injury.
