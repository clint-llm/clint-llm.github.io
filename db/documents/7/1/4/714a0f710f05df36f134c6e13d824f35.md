Birth asphyxia is not an uncommon event, and because of its high morbidity and mortality, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team. However, the long-term prognosis of these infants has been difficult to assess. In the short term, the condition is reported to have a mortality in excess of 30%, with the majority of deaths occurring within the first few days after birth. Those infants who survive are often left with mild to severe neurological deficits, and they also end up dying from aspiration or systemic infections. Long-term survivors have been found to have disabling cerebral palsy, inadequate mental development or low psychomotor scores, seizures, blindness, and severe hearing impairment. The management of these infants, in the long run, is complex and prohibitively expensive.
