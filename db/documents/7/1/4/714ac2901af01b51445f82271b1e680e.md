The most common patient population with tears of the peroneal tendons are active young patients. Tears are more likely to be longitudinal due to subluxation over the fibula, but can also be transverse. The peroneus brevis is more often torn isolated peroneus longus tears occur less frequently. A retrospective review of peroneal tendon tears showed brevis tears in 88% of patients, longus tears in 13% of patients and combined peroneus longus and brevis tears in 37%.
