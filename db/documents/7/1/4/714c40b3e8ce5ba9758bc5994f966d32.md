Being diagnosed with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and undergoing treatment can have significant psychosocial impacts on patients and their families, as these can bring dramatic changes in their physical, spiritual, emotional, and interpersonal dimensions. Every clinic visit should include screening and assessment of emotional and social concerns of patients and their families. They should also be well-informed of the types of treatment, such as CRT and combination chemotherapy regimens, pros and cons of each treatment, side effects, supportive measures, and long-term management plan. Regular follow-up with primary care physicians and oncologists is also important to monitor treatment response and treatment-related toxicities.
