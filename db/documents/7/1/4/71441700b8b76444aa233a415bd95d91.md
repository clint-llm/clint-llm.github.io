Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disease emerging from mutations of genes for enzymes that lead to the production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and sex steroids by the adrenal glands. This activity summarizes the evaluation and management of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
- Summarize the role of diagnostic imaging in the evaluation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
- Outline the management of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to enhance care coordination for patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
