Hypovolemic shock is due to a critical loss in the effective circulating blood volume with systemic hypoperfusion. If left untreated, hypovolemic shock can lead to ischemic injury of vital organs, leading to multi-system organ failure and death. The first step in management is to rule out other forms of shock, which will dictate treatment. Hypovolemic shock may be due to loss in total body fluids versus bleeding. When the etiology of hypovolemic shock has been determined, blood or fluid loss replacement should be carried out as soon as possible to minimize tissue ischemia. Factors to consider when replacing fluid or blood volume loss include the type and rate of fluid replacement. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of shock and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hypovolemic shock.
- Outline the presentation of hypovolemic shock.
- List the treatment and management options available for hypovolemic shock.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of hypovolemic shock and improve outcomes.
