Patients with oculocerebrorenal syndrome present with abnormalities in multiple organ systems. These clinical findings will be reviewed in detail by the system.

**The Nervous System**

The burden of illness in patients with oculocerebrorenal syndrome is heavily based on the involvement of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Severe hypotonia and absence of deep tendon reflexes are some early clinical manifestations.

Infants may have impaired feeding as a consequence of weak or ineffective sucking. Hypotonia in infants also delays the achievement of motor milestones, such as ambulating independently. Patients are also prone to developing seizures, which can vary in type and severity. Intellectual disability is typical in most patients with Lowe syndrome and can range from mild to severe.

Patients tend to develop conduct disorders, such as aggression and obsessive-compulsive behavior. This maladaptive behavior interferes with daily functioning and can lead to self-injury.

**The Ocular System**

The visual potential in patients with oculocerebrorenal syndrome is low due to multiple phenotypic findings. The classic ocular manifestation is the presence of bilateral cataracts, which form in-utero and are often managed by cataract surgery in infancy.

Cataract formation in these patients is thought to be secondary to a genetic defect that affects the migration of the crystalline lens epithelial cells.

Intraocular pressures can be challenging to treat, and patients are often on multiple topical medications. Surgical intervention may be required for more aggressive intraocular pressure control. Developing conjunctival or corneal keloids has been reported in Lowe syndrome, sometimes leading to vision-threatening corneal scars. Other ophthalmic findings include nystagmus and strabismus.

Characteristic lenticular opacities, distributed radially in all layers of the cortex, have been linked to carriers of the OCRL gene.

**The Renal System**

In patients with oculocerebrorenal syndrome, the characteristic renal disease is characterized by Fanconi syndrome with proximal tubular dysfunction and progressive renal failure. Renal disease may not be present at birth but may manifest in early infancy. Impaired endocytosis in the proximal tubules results in low-molecular-weight (LMW) proteinuria, often in the nephrotic range.

Patients are also at risk of developing hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

Chronic, progressive renal failure is a hallmark of Lowe syndrome and requires close monitoring of kidney function. By the fourth decade of life, most patients have stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD).

**The Musculoskeletal System**

Osteopenia, tenosynovitis, and debilitating arthropathy are frequent musculoskeletal manifestations of oculocerebrorenal syndrome. Hypophosphatemia and metabolic acidosis can exacerbate osteopenia and lead to pathologic fractures.

**Other Findings**

Certain dermatologic findings reported in patients with Lowe syndrome include benign cystic lesions, thought to originate from hair follicles.

While puberty and testosterone levels are reportedly normal in most patients with Lowe syndrome, about one-third of males have cryptorchidism.
