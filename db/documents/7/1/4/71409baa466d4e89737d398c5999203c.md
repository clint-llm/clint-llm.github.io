A healthy optic nerve is aÂ crucial conduit for impulses generated within the layers of the retina to leave the eye. Electrical signals are initiated by the photoreceptors in response to incident light, modified by retinal bipolar cells, and transmitted through the optic nerves to the lateral geniculate bodies. Damage to the nerve fiber layer or optic nerve may compromise the quality of these signals.

The term optic neuritis (ON) is used to describe a variety of conditions affecting the optimal function of the optic nerve. A wide range of conditions including infections, trauma, vascular insufficiency, metastases, toxins, or nutritional deficiencies may cause optic neuropathies but this article focuses on optic neuritis (ON), an inflammatory condition that demyelinates the optic nerve and degrades vision in one or both eyes.
