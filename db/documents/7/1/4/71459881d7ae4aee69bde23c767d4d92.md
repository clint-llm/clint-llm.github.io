Lichen planus (LP) is thought to be a T-cell mediated auto-immune inflammatory disorder, which destroys basal epithelial cells.

Hepatitis C is well known to be associated with LP, although the link between HCV and erosive LP has not been established. Odds ratios of up to 5.4 for HCV positivity were found among patients with LP. However, this association was not significant statistically among all geographic groups in further analysis.
