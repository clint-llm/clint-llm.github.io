Vaginal discharge and discomfort are common complaints of women through all stages of life. Vaginitis is a frequently encountered problem for providers who take care of female patients. When evaluating a patient for a vaginal complaint, such as discharge or irritation, it is important first to understand what the range of normal findings can be on examination. Once the provider understands what can be normal it is generallyÂ easier to establish when a pathogenic process is present and when such a process recurs.
