Motor innervation of the trapezius is via cranial nerve 11, also known as the spinal accessory nerve, and sensation is via the ventral rami of C3/C4.

Innervation of the latissimus dorsi is by the thoracodorsal nerve (also known as the middle subscapular nerve). This nerve is one of the branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

Motor innervation of the levator scapulae comes from branches of the third and fourth cervical spinal nerves and the dorsal scapular nerve.

Innervation of both rhomboid muscles comes from the dorsal scapular nerve of C4 and C5.

The serratus muscles are innervated by the intercostal nerves of the ribs that they bypass.
