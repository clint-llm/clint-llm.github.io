Patients with new-onset 3Â or more loose or unformed stools in 24 hours with no obvious other etiology should be checked for testing for C. difficile infection. Stool examination for C. difficile toxins or toxigenic C. difficile bacillus is the commonly used diagnostic test used to diagnose C. difficile infection. Several techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme immune assays for C. difficile toxin A, toxin B, and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), cell culture cytotoxic assay, and selective anaerobic culture can be used in making the diagnosis.
