The sensory epithelium of the cochlea is the organ of Corti. It is contained within the scala media of the cochlea and is composed of sensory hair cells and non-sensory supporting cells. The sensory cells are the OHCs, and the IHCs are arranged uniquely. There is a single row of IHCs and three rows of OHCs separated by supporting cells.
