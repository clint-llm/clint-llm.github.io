To date, the exact etiology of the muscle dystonia in Sandifer syndrome remains unidentified. It may be associated with the diaphragm and the head and neck area sharing common innervation. Frankel was able to prove the direct relationship between dystonic movements and low pH, and he measured the pH in a patient with SS. He recorded 83 episodes of posturing, and none of these episodes occurred during a period of pH >5 for â‰¥30 seconds.
