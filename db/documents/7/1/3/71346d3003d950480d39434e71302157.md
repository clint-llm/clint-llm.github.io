A high level of suspicion should be kept in diagnosing lipoid pneumonia, especially in patients with acute severe lung disease without other comorbid conditions. Imaging is an integral part of diagnosis; this includes a chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, which shows common characteristic findings. In 1996 one retrospective multicenter study of exogenous lipoid pneumonia completed in France by Gondouin et al. emphasized, in particular, the diagnostic importance of computed tomography scan.

Arterial blood gas can be used to assess pH, acid-base status, and oxygenation.

Bronchoscopy allows clinicians to obtain respiratory samples via alveolar lavage that can be sent for specific histological and cytological stains.

Blood and sputum cultures can help to rule out underlying infection.
