The introduction of postnatal immunoprophylaxis in 1970 reduced the incidence of maternal RhD alloimmunization from 14% to 1 or 2%. Subsequently, antenatal immunoprophylaxis was also started, which further reduced RhD alloimmunization to 0.1%.

The incidence of Rh incompatibility varies by race and ethnicity. Approximately 15% of whites are Rh-negative, compared with only 5% to 8% of African Americans and 1% to 2% of Asians and Native Americans. Among whites, an Rh-negative woman has an approximate 85% chance of mating with an Rh-positive man, 60% of whom are heterozygous, and 40% of whom are homozygous at the D locus.
