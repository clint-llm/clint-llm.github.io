The patient is situated on the operating room table in a semi-lithotomy position (legs elevated and spread), most commonly with Allen stirrups, to allow prepped and draped access to the abdomen and perineum. Visualization of the pelvis is facilitated with a head-down (Trendelenburg) positioning of the operating room table. Surgical exploration is performed through a midline incision. A thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity, including the liver/spleen, gastrointestinal viscera, omentum, and peritoneal surfaces, is performed to exclude any metastasis beyond the anticipated extent of pelvic resection.

Dissection is initiated by incising the peritoneum overlying the iliac vessels and mobilizing the node bearing tissue medially to include with the specimen. The iliac branches to the specimen are ligated along with the Cardinal ligament in females. The peritoneum of the superior/anterior bladder is incised to mobilize the bladder posterior with the specimen. Each ureter is ligated proximal to the tumor and preserved for establishing urinary outflow. In males, the anterior dissection is carried to the pelvic floor, thus mobilizing the prostate, and the urethra is ligated. In females, the dissection is also carried to the pelvic floor and terminated at the urethra/vagina. Posterior, the inferior mesenteric pedicle is ligated at or above the aortic bifurcation. The sigmoid mesentery is divided, preserving the remaining blood supply, and the sigmoid colon is transected in preparation for a colostomy. The rectum is mobilized from the presacral fascia posterior, to assure a Total Mesorectal Excision, to beyond the tip of the coccyx. The dissection is continued bilaterally along the fascia of the pelvic sidewalls until the rectum and vagina/prostate are fully mobilized to the pelvic floor.

To complete the resection, the remaining perineal attachments are excised. An elliptical incision is made on each side of the anus, beginning just anterior to the coccyx. The anterior extent of the incision is carried across the perineum at the base of the scrotum or incorporating the vaginal introitus up to the clitoris. The soft tissues are divided down to the pelvic floor musculature. The pelvic floor is divided from the coccyx to the ischial tuberosities at the lateral extent and anterior to the urethral hiatus. The specimen, including the rectum, anus, vagina/prostate, and bladder, can be passed from the operative field as an en bloc resection.

Reconstruction is extensive. The pelvic floor defect can be closed with either a polypropylene mesh and covered with local soft tissue mobilization such as omentum, or the defect can be closed with a rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap. In some instances, gracilis myocutaneous flaps can be used for reconstruction of the floor or creation of a neovagina. Vaginal reconstruction is also performed with skin grafts or an isolated segment of the bowel.

For urinary outflow, a segment of vascularized ileum is isolated from the distal small bowel. Bowel continuity is restored with a proximal to distal segment enteroenterostomy. The ureters are implanted into the isolated segment of the ileum. The resulting ileal conduit (Bricker pouch) is matured via a right lower quadrant abdominal wall defect to the skin creating a urostomy. Currently, a continent urostomy has been popularized using the transverse colon and ileocecum. The transverse colon is fashioned as a pouch and the ureters are implanted. Either the residual terminal ileum or appendix is matured to the skin. The patient periodically catheterizes the stoma to evacuate urine. An additional advantage of the continent conduit is that the transverse colon is relatively spared from radiation effects reducing the risk of urinary fistulas.

The reconstruction is completed by maturing the proximal sigmoid colon to the skin via a left lower quadrant abdominal wall defect.

For a partial or posterior PE in a female, the urinary structures are preserved. The uterus and vagina are mobilized from the bladder in the anterior plane. The anterior dissection is carried to the pelvic floor. The perineal excision preserves a cuff of the vagina at the urethral orifice to facilitate urinary outflow. For a partial or anterior PE in a female, the bladder and gynecologic structures are resected en bloc while preserving the rectum and anus. The perineal excision is carried out anterior to the anus with complete excision of the vaginal introitus.

For locally advanced tumors involving the pelvic sidewalls, the internal iliac artery and vein can be ligated and divided to gain access to the extra-fascial plane lateral to these structures.

Additional variations of PE involve the preservation of the pelvic floor. When adequate tumor margins can be obtained without resecting the pelvic floor musculature, the rectum and/or the vagina can be divided and closed above the pelvic floor. When the anal sphincter can be preserved, bowel continuity can be restored with either a low anterior or coloanal anastomosis with temporary diverting loop ileostomy for protection.

The complex multi-visceral and extended resections of PE are associated with prolonged operative times (5-14 hours) and substantial blood loss.
