The aortic valve consists of three cusps that prevent the backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle. Mostly the three cusps have different sizes.

Aortic stenosis can present with shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, etc. Aortic regurgitation leads to a diastolic blowing type murmur in the third intercostal space on the left side along the sternal border. Aortic valve calcification, bicuspid valve, rheumatic heart disease, and root dilatation are common causes of regurgitation. Palpitations and shortness of breath are common symptoms of aortic regurgitation.

In the Ross procedure, the pulmonary valve of the patient is used to replace the defected aortic valve. The pulmonic valve is replaced with a bovine jugular vein conduit in patients less than six years. Decellular pulmonary homograft is preferred for older patients.
