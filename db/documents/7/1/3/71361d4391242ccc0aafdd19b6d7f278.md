Post-cholecystectomy syndrome is generally a temporary diagnosis as further workup establishes an organic or functional diagnosis. Upon determining the diagnosis, treatment should be guided by the specific diagnosis made and may include pharmacologic or procedural approaches.

Pharmacologic approach

The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent complications and reduce morbidity. The following approaches may be pursued in the management of patients with PCS

- Administration of bulking agents, antispasmodics, or sedatives may be beneficial in patients with irritable bowel syndrome

- Cholestyramine may be helpful for patients with diarrhea alone

- For patients with GERD or gastritis symptoms, antacids, histamine-2 blockers, or proton-pump inhibitors may provide relief from symptoms

- One study demonstrated that patients with dyspeptic symptoms correlated with the concentration of gastric bile salt - however, this has not been reproducible; these patients may benefit from bile acid binders such as cholestyramine.

Procedural approach

Procedural therapy should point towards the specific diagnosis, just like pharmacologic therapy

In cases of post-cholecystectomy syndrome resulting from remnant cystic duct lithiasis or Mirizzi syndrome, stone extraction by endoscopic therapy may be sufficient. However, surgical excision of the remnant cystic duct may be necessary in some cases to prevent future development of PCS
