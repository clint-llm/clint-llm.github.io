The distribution of lymphatic vessels of the lower limb is similar to the distribution of the veins of the lower limb and can divide into two major groups: superficial and deep. The superficial vessels are the great saphenous vein (medial) and lesser saphenous vein (lateral). The great saphenous vein drains into the inguinal lymph nodes, while the lesser saphenous vein drains into the popliteal nodes. The deep lymphatic vessels contain the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal vessels, which follow each of their respective arteries and drain into the popliteal nodes.
