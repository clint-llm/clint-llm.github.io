Complications can arise from failure of the KPro to biocolonise (non-epithelization) and biointegrate (corneal melt around the optic). Ongoing inflammation in the anterior chamber and the formation of retroprosthetic membranes are common complications. Corneal tissueÂ melt can lead to leakage and endophthalmitis, repaired with the regrafting cornea and autologous cartilage tissue.

After successful artificial cornea transplantation (all types), glaucoma is the most common complication and can even affect the eyes during late follow-up. High preoperative intraocular pressure, autoimmune diseases such as mucous membrane pemphigoid, and Steven Johnson syndrome lead to a higher risk for glaucoma development and progression. In a recent single-center study of 140 eyes following Boston KPro Type I implantation, 24% of eyes developed de novo glaucoma postoperatively.

Combined KPro-vitrectomy eyes show a decreased incidence of retroprosthetic membrane formation and more stable long-term vision compared with non-vitrectomised eyes.

The OOKP is fully biocompatible (if using the patient's tooth); however, complications persist. These range from oral (buccal mucosa harvesting), oculoplastic, secondary glaucoma, posterior segment, and device extrusion. Vitreoretinal complications include retinal detachment, vitritis, retroprosthetic membrane, vitreous hemorrhage, choroidal detachment, and endophthalmitis.
