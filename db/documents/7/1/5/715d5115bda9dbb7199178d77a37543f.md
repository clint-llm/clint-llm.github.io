Parahiatal hernia is a rare type of diaphragmatic hernia. Its rarity could either be due to one or a combination of the following three factors; confusion about the anatomy, similarity in clinical presentation with paraesophageal hernias, and not frequently reported in the literature. These hernias are associated with increased morbidity and mortality if not identified and managed appropriately. This activity reviews the anatomy of parahiatal hernia, compares it with other diaphragmatic hernias, and highlights the importance of different approaches to its management to improve the care of patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the hiatus.
- Identify the typical imaging findings in parahiatal hernia.
- Explain the reasons for the misdiagnosis of parahiatal hernia.
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with parahiatal hernia.
