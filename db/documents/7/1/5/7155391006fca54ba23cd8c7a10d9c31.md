Addison disease is a serious life-threatening disorder that affects many organs. If the diagnosis is delayed, it carries very high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare workers that includes an endocrinologist, intensivist, infectious disease expert, gastroenterologist, and pharmacist. The education of patients is mandatory. Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists can do this. Nurses administer treatments, monitor patients, and provide updates to the team. Once the diagnosis is made, the outcomes depend on the primary cause. Any delay in starting corticosteroid treatment can lead to mortality rates exceeding 50%. All patients diagnosed with Addison disease must be urged to wear a medical alert bracelet. Patients should be educated on the signs and symptoms and contact their primary care provider at the slightest change in their vital signs. Finally, in times of stress, even a common cold, the patient should be told to double the steroid dose and see their primary care provider.
