Damage or disruption of living tissue's cellular, anatomical, and/or functional continuum defines a wound. Before treatment, the exact cause, location, and type of wound must be assessed to provide appropriate care. Each clinician will have widely differing and distinct opinions on wound therapy depending on prior experiences. Given that non-healing wounds affect millions of people in the United States impacting a significant percentage of persons 65 years and older, minimizing wound complications is essential in the current healthcare environment. This activity addresses protocol for wound assessment for the interprofessional team during initial and subsequent wound assessments to best classify and treat a wound to enhance outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the initial assessment of a wound.
- Explain the potential complications in wound care.
- Identify the two types of wounds.
- Outline optimal wound management based on the assessed type of wound.
