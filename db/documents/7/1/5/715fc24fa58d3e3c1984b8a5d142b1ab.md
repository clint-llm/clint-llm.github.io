Rh-negative mothers that have become sensitized to the D antigen may have been exposed to the D antigen in many ways. Taking a detailed history may reveal potential sensitizing events such as:

Exposure to fetal Rh-positive blood

- Delivery (i.e., vaginal, Cesarean section)

- Threatened miscarriage, miscarriage

- Antepartum hemorrhage (e.g., placenta previa, abruption, vasa previa, uterine rupture)

- Trauma

- External cephalic version

- Invasive procedures (e.g., chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis)

- Ectopic Pregnancy

- Molar pregnancy

Nonfetal exposure to Rh-positive blood

- Transfusion

- Bone marrow transplantation

- Needle-stick injury

While Rh incompatibility does not typically lead to clinical signs and symptoms in the Rh-negative mother, the consequences on the Rh-positive fetus can be substantial. While the topic of HDN is one that will be discussed elsewhere, some clinical features of HDN secondary to Rh incompatibility include lethargy, pallor, jaundice, scleral icterus, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Hydrops fetalis is severe, life-threatening hemolytic anemia (that presents with at least two of the following: edema, pericardial effusions, pleural effusions, ascites) and is associated with a significant mortality rate estimated to be moreÂ than 50%.
