A comprehensive history and physical is necessary to determine the nature of the pain and its impact on life

- the context in which the pain started

- duration of pain

- pain location +/- radiating

- quality of pain- eliciting descriptors such as "aching, dull, sharp or burning",

- pain severity- using a numerical rating scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable

- the timing of pain, whether constant or intermittent

- alleviating and aggravating factors

Past medical history, and reviewing prior diagnostic testing and imaging provides valuable information on identifying the pain generator. Assessing other therapies tried for pain such as prior medications, interventions, therapies both physical and cognitive, alternative modalities, and response to these therapies are relevant to formulating a treatment plan.

A thorough musculoskeletal and neurological physical exam are necessary systems to evaluate for pain.  Checking reflexes, strength, sensation, and gait can reveal deficits and compensatory movements patients adopt due to pain.  Assessing for tender points, trigger points, and hypermobility are relevant features to identify in patients with musculoskeletal pain.
