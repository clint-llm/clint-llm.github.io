The management of primary biliary cholangitis is best done through an interprofessional team approach. The disorder has no cure and carries high morbidity and mortality. The aim of treatment is to slow down the disease progression and improve the quality of life. Besides the physicians, the nurse, mental health counselor, pharmacist, and physical therapist play a critical role in the management of these patients. The nurse should educate the patient on the management of itching and the use of moisturizers. The dietitian should educate the patient on a healthy diet to prevent osteoporosis and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the Sicca syndrome and how to avoid dry eyes and mouth. Because of extreme fatigue, the patient should enroll in a physical therapy program or some type of physical activity. Finally, the patient should see a mental health counselor as the disorder can result in premature death. The patient should be urged to join a support group and closely follow up with the healthcare provider.

**Outcomes**

In patients with low serum albumin, survival can range from 3-6 years. However, if the bilirubin levels are consistently high, the survival is significantly reduced with an average survival of 1.7 years. Almost all patients with PBC develop moderate-to-severe fatigue, which persists even after a liver transplant. Universally, once patients develop symptoms, the outcome is grim.
