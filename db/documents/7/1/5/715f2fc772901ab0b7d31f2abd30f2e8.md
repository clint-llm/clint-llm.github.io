A skin biopsy is the most useful study for the diagnosis of EED. Electron microscopy is not a necessary diagnostic tool but would show changes and features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in patients with EED is often elevated. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies of IgA class may be helpful as a marker of disease, and Immunoelectrophoresis can also be used to identify possible gammopathies.
