Morphine is an extremely beneficial medication when used appropriately. However, in certain situations, this medication may be strongly contraindicated. Extreme cautionÂ is necessary with severe respiratory depression and asthma exacerbation cases since morphine can further decrease the respiratory drive. Additionally, morphine should be avoided in cases of previous hypersensitivity reaction and immediately discontinued in the presence of an active reaction.
