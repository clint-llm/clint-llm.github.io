The diagnosis and management of ARN are complex and only a prompt diagnosis can help save vision. Healthcare workers including the nurse practitioner and primary care physicians who see patients with herpes simplex infection of the eye should immediately refer these patients to an ophthalmologist. Immediate treatment of the patient is required and can be done in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. The goal is to decrease the incidence in the fellow eye.

The visual prognosis of ARN is poor and 64% of affected eyes achieve a final acuity of worse than 20/200 due to multiple complications including retinal detachment, optic neuropathy, macular abnormality, and retinal ischemia.
