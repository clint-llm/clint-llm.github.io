Three essential elements of the history and physical in an individual with suspected brief psychotic disorder are:

- The presence of at least one positive psychotic symptom such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or disorganized or catatonic behavior

- Establishing that the symptoms have not been present for less than one day or more than one month

- Investigating if the disturbance in behavior is otherwise explainable by another mood disorder, medical condition, or substance/medication use

In order to further classify individual cases of brief psychotic disorder, it becomes essential to recognize if the triggering of psychotic symptoms were from a stressful event or if it is postpartum. Common stressors are death, environmental disaster, military activity, recent immigration.
