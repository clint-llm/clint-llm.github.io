History and physical examination findings differ based on the disease category presented. With type II hypersensitivity reactions, during the history taking, the patient might report repeated blood transfusions, blood group or rhesus incompatibility, or a history of recent drug intake. The patient might clinically present with features of autoimmunity, e.g., immune thrombocytopenia (characterized by bleeding disorders), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (characterized by jaundice), and other blood dyscrasias (autoimmune neutropenia).

n myasthenia gravis, the patient could have symptoms suggestive of generalized muscle weakness with difficulty in mobilizing, eating, speech, and carrying out routine activities.
