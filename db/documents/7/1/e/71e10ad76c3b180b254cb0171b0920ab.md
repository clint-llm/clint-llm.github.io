The specific etiology of PPP is unknown. However, the mechanism of pressure from standing or applying pressure to the heel induces herniation of fat into connective tissue in the dermis of the heels is easily replicated. One hypothesis is that elevated pressures may induce small tears in the plantar fascia, thereby creating a defect for herniation of the deep subcutaneous fat. In cases associated with collagen disorder, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a structural abnormality of the connective tissue has been suspected but not proven.
