Most AAA are asymptomatic, but some patients may present with flank or abdominal pain, indigestion, or a bloating sensation-hence. One should be suspicious of this pathology.

The diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysmÂ is usually made with ultrasound (US), but a CT scan is needed to determine the exact location, size, and involvement of other vessels. The US can be used for screening purposes but is less accurate for aneurysms above the renal arteries because of the overlying air-containing lung and viscera. CTA requires the use of ionizing radiation and intravenous contrast. Magnetic resonance angiography can be used as well to delineate the anatomy and does not require ionizing radiation.

Most of these aneurysms are located below the origin of the renal arteries. They may be classified as saccular (localized) or fusiform (circumferential). Some people may develop an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is characterized by intense inflammation, a thickened peel, and adhesions to adjacent structures. Angiography is now rarely done to make the diagnosis because of the superior images obtained with CT scans.
