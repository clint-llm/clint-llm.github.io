There are different therapeutic options available for patients with peritoneal carcinoma, but this topic will be about using HIPEC. This activity describes and explains the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients who undergo HIPEC.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
- Identify the indications for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
- Summarize the risks and benefits associated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies that can be employed to ensure optimal outcomes for patients who need hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy performed.
