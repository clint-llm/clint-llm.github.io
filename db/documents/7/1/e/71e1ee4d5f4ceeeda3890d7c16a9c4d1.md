Ganglion cysts may be encountered by a number of healthcare professionals including the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, hand surgeon, plastic surgeon and orthopedic surgeon. These harmless lesions do not always require treatment. Only symptomatic patients should undergo treatment but if not completely excised, there is a risk of recurrence. Asymptomatic patients can be followed. The prognosis for most patients is excellent.
