In the acute setting, similar to other penetrating trauma, neurovascular injuries and acute fractures are possible.

Inadequate exploration or wound care can lead to a retained foreign body or retained devitalized tissue leading to infection and further tissue loss and morbidity. Even with proper care and appropriate antibiotic selection, patients can still develop serious wound infections leading to tissue necrosis, sepsis, and/or limb amputation.
