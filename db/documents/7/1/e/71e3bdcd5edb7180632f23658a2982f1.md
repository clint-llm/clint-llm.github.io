The history and physical exam findings should be consistent with those seen in peripheral vertigo. The patient may have balance issues with gait. Symptoms may become worse depending on the patient's position, with the vertical position typically the worst. They may have horizontal nystagmus present. The sensation of “spinning” is in the direction of the ear with the higher pressure in the middle ear. Head impulse testing and test of skew should be suggestive of peripheral vertigo. Neurologic examination should otherwise be normal.
