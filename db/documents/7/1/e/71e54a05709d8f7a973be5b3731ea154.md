The anterior compartment of the thigh receives blood from the femoral artery, which comes from the external iliac. The femoral artery travels laterally to the femoral vein down the anterior thigh and then passes to the posterior thigh through the adductor hiatus. The deep artery of the thigh is the largest branch of the femoral artery. It dives deep and passes posteriorly to the adductor longus to supply the adductor magnus, hamstrings, and vastus lateralis. The medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries branch off the deep artery of the thigh and run around the head of the femur to supply the muscles in that area. The obturator artery splits into anterior and posterior branches and helps supply the adductor muscles.

The lymph from the leg travels to the superficial popliteal lymph nodes, and the lymph vessels travel along with the femoral vessels to the deep inguinal lymph nodes. Lymph from the superficial tissues of the thigh drains to the superficial inguinal nodes. These drain into the external and common iliac, and right and left lumbar lymph nodes. These then drain to the cisterna chyli and then the thoracic duct.
