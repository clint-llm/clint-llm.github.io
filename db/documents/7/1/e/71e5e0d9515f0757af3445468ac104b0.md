Appendicitis is an acute inflammatory process involving the appendix. It is the number one surgical emergency and one of the most common causes of abdominal pain, particularly in children. It should be considered in any patient with acute abdominal pain without prior appendectomy. The diagnosis must be made as quickly as possible because with time, the rate of rupture increases. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on a differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when pediatric appendicitis should be suspected.
- Identify the evaluations that should be done when pediatric appendicitis is suspected. 
- Outline the management of pediatric appendicitis. 
- Explain the role of collaboration among interprofessional team members to improve care coordination and minimize oversight, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment and better outcomes for children with appendicitis.
