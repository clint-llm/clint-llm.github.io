There are multiple complications associated with peripheral neuropathy, with the major complication being amputation. Amputations are due to ulcerations in a neuropathic foot associated with infection. In the United States, roughly 80% of nontraumatic amputations have been seen due to diabetes and peripheral neuropathy. With each ulceration and amputation, the morbidity and mortality rate increases, with the probability of contralateral amputation and death increasing with each ulceration and surgical intervention.

One study on predicting the lower extremity amputation rates in patients with diabetic foot ulcers found that roughly 35.4% of patients underwent amputation and that multiple factors such as soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, duration of ulceration, and vascular insufficiency or peripheral arterial disease played a significant role in this prevalence.

Many complications are discussed in the previous sections.
