Perioperative and intraoperative C-arm fluoroscopy is an important tool in orthopedic surgery. It enhances surgical decision-making and decreases the duration of surgery, but it poses a risk of ionizing radiation exposure to the patient and the surgeon. Thorough knowledge of fluoroscopy techniques allows for shaper imaging to reduce radiation exposure to the surgeon and the patient. This activity provides a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of fluoroscopy, application of fluoroscopy in orthopedics, interpretation, techniques, application in special situations, and safety protocols used by the interprofessional team to minimize radiation exposure with emphasis on the need for training in radiation safety and recent advances.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the common indications of fluoroscopy in orthopedics.
- Outline risk factors of imaging and psychosocial considerations for patients undergoing fluoroscopy.
- Identify management considerations for patients with special considerations like pregnancy and pediatric patients.
- Explain the common use by the interprofessional team of fluoroscopy equipment.
