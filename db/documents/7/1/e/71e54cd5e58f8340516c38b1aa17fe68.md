A thorough history is imperative as there are no pathognomonic imaging studies or available testing consistent with vestibular migraine. Despite this, there are nonspecific findings noted with certain studies. One such example comes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI has shown an associated finding consistent with a general migraine. White matter hyperintensities are four times more likely in this group as compared to age and gender-matched controls.

Vestibular testing and neurotologic exams typically yield nondiagnostic abnormalities in those with isolated probable or definite vestibular migraines. It must be recognized, that if an individual has Meniere syndrome or BPPV association, they are more likely to have abnormal testing.

Another study has shown an increased incidence of unilateral canal paresis on caloric testing and vestibular hyporesponsiveness or hyperresponsiveness in vestibular migraine patients.
