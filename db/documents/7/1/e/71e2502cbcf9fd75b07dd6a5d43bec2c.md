Hurler syndrome was first described by German pediatrician, Gertrud Hurler in 1919. It is one of the 11 disorders of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Hurler syndrome is considered as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPH I) and formerly known as gargoylism. In 1962, a milder form of MPS I was identified and named as Scheie syndrome.

It is an inherited lysosomal disorder caused by the absence of alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme which responsible for degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG or mucopolysaccharides). This leads to a buildup of dermatan sulfate and heparin sulfate in multiple tissues, resulting in progressive deterioration and, eventually, death.
