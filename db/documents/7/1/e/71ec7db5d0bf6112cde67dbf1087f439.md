The predominant blood supply to the mandible derives from the inferior alveolar artery. The inferior alveolar artery originates from one of the terminal arteries the external carotid artery forms. This terminal artery is the maxillary artery. The maxillary further branches into arteries that provide the face perfusion, but the inferior alveolar artery descends to perfuse mainly the mandible.

The inferior alveolar artery branches from the first portion of the maxillary artery. The inferior alveolar artery is responsible for the majority of the perfusion to the nerves, gingivae, and teeth of the lower jaw. The perfusion territory of the inferior alveolar artery corresponds to the structures that surround and encompasses the mandible bone.
