Posterior cortical atrophy typically presents early (< 65 years). An international study of 302 patients with posterior cortical atrophy showed a peak onset between 50 and 65 years of age with diminishing incidence with age.

The proportion of patients diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy depends on the clinical context. It varies from 5% in specialty cognitive clinicsÂ to 13 % when looking at early-onset Alzheimer disease data.
