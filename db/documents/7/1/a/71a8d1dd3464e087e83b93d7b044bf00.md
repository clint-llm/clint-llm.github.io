The onset of PACNS is usually insidious, and the course is slowly progressive. Acute presentations have also been reported but are, however, less common. Symptoms of PACNS are non-specific, and multiple symptoms are usually present at the initial presentation. A headache is the most common presenting symptom; other common presenting symptoms include cognitive dysfunction and stroke. Overall, the presenting symptoms and signs from the most common to the least common include:

- A headache

- Cognitive dysfunction

- Stroke

- Transient ischemic attack (TIA)

- Aphasia

- Visual symptoms including visual field deficits, blurred vision, and double vision

- Seizures

- Ataxia

- Papilledema

- Intracranial bleeding

- Amnestic syndrome

A combination of symptoms is usually present in most patients. PACNS should always be considered as a possibility in cases of rapidly progressive cognitive decline and personality changes of unknown etiology.
