The presentation of pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae is similar to that seen in community-acquired pneumonia. Patients may have a cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, and shortness of breath. One stark difference between community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae is the type of sputum produced. The sputum produced by those with S. pneumoniae is described as “blood-tinged” or “rust-colored,” however, the sputum produced by those infected by K. pneumoniae is described as “currant jelly.” The reason for this is that K. pneumoniae results in significant inflammation and necrosis of the surrounding tissue.

Klebsiella pneumonia usually affects the upper lobes but can involve the lower lobes as well. The examination usually reveals unilateral signs of consolidation, such as crepitation, bronchial breathing, and increased vocal resonance, mostly in the upper lobe. In the case of nosocomial infections, the presence of burn sites, wounds, and invasive devices should be searched.

Host factors that predispose to colonization and infection are as follow:

- Admission to an intensive care ward

- Prolonged use of invasive devices

- Poor infection control strategies

- Immunocomproside especially alcoholics and diabetics

- Prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics

Bacteria enter the host either by direct inoculation or by following oropharyngeal aspiration.
