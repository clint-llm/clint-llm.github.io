Several anomalies of the nipple have been recognized, including the following:

- An accessory nipple is reported to occur in 1% to 4% of the population and has an equal incidence in both females and males. The accessory nipple is usually located in the inframammary area and is prone to the same medical disorders as the typical nipple. The accessory nipple can be excised if it causes anxiety, poor cosmesis, discomfort, or limits arm movement.

- Athelia or the congenital absence of the nipple areolar complex does occur in patients with Poland syndrome. The condition is also associated with an underdevelopedÂ breast.

- Amastia is known as the complete absence of all breast tissue except for the nipple areolar complex.

- The inverted nipple is a common anomaly, where the nipple is retracted into the breast instead of pointing outwards. In some cases, the inverted nipple may alternatively protrude and retract. The inverted nipple can occur in men and women. The inverted nipple does make it difficult to breastfeed.
