The goal of postoperative pain control is to reduce the negative consequences associated with acute postsurgical pain and help the patient make a smooth transition back to normal function. Traditionally, opioid analgesic therapy has served as the mainstay of treatment for acute postoperative pain. However, the recent rise in morbidity and mortality associated with opioid misuse has led to increasing demands for more investigative efforts into developing pain treatment strategies that place more emphasis on using a multimodal approach.

Approximately 75 percent of patients who undergo surgery experience acute postoperative pain, which is often medium-high in severity.

Among the issues that make pain control difficult is a lack of pain level surveillance protocols or intervention guidelines that would help provide more efficient means of adjusting therapy for providing better pain relief.
