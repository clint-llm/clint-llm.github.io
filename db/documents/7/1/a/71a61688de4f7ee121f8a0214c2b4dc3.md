Despite well-established underlying pathophysiology in the pathogenesis of other forms of lymphoma, both non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma, the pathophysiology underlying primary hepatic lymphoma is largely underdetermined. An exception to this is the association of primary hepatic lymphoma with some viruses, notably the hepatitis C virus (HCV), where the virus is thought to stimulate B cells which initially leads to polyclonal and then to monoclonal B cell expression. Hepatitis C virus has been proposed to cause translocation and hence overexpression of the anti-apoptotic factors, bcl2, and monoclonal IgH rearrangement. Additionally, HCV alters the transcriptional regulation of genes like p21, p53, and H-ras by the viral core and/ or NS35 proteins.
