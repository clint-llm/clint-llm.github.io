Primarily, the glossopharyngeal nerve innervates the carotid sinus, particularly the branch called theÂ sinus nerve of Hering. The glossopharyngeal nerve will synapse with the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem's medulla, which will send information to the autonomic nervous system to control MAP. The glossopharyngeal nerve is a mixed nerve, and it is the general visceral afferent component that carries the sensory information from the carotid sinus.
