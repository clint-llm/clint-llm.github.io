Adult T cell leukemia is chemoresistant and carries a poor prognosis despite the recent progress in treatment modalities. In general, the prognosis of acute and lymphoma subtypes is poor compared with that of chronic and smoldering types. Lymphoma Study Group from 1984 to 1987 reported that median survival time was 6 months for acute type, 10 months for the lymphoma type, and 24 months for the chronic type.

The OS at 4 years for acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering subtypes were 11%, 16%, 36%, and 52%, respectively. Although outcomes appear to be slightly better when comparing two studies, the long-term prognosis of ATL is still unsatisfactory. Based on 854 patients with newly diagnosed ATL between 1983 and 1987, the Japan Clinical Oncology Group-Lymphoma Study Group (JCOG-LSG) identified five prognostic factors, including advanced performance status (PS), high lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), age ≥40 years, ≥3 involved lesions, and hypercalcemia.

Other poor prognostic factors were identified in several studies for acute and lymphoma subtypes, including bone marrow involvement, skin involvement, and monocytosis.
