Cardiac troponins are specific and sensitive biomarkers of cardiac ischemia, and they are the preferred blood test in the evaluation of patients suspected to have acute MI. There are sensitive and highly sensitive assays to detect cardiac troponin levels in the blood. The highly sensitive troponin assay obtained approval for use in the USA in 2017. Although CK-MB has a high sensitivity for cardiac myocytes, it should not be used as a first-line diagnostic test if cardiac troponin assays are available. In the absence of cardiac troponin assays, CK-MB can be useful in the evaluation of acute MI, but it is far less sensitive and specific than cardiac troponins. Since cardiac troponin levels remain elevated in the blood for multiple days after an acute MI, they are not useful in evaluating for re-infarction of cardiac myocytes (another MI). CK-MB levels normalize 48 to 72 hours after an acute MI, so a rising level in the blood after normalization can confirm that another MI has occurred.

Clinicians need to understand that cardiac markers are not mandatory in patients who present with acute chest pain mimicking angina and ECG evidence of ST-segment elevation. These individuals are candidates for primary coronary intervention or thrombolytic therapy. One should not delay treatment waiting for cardiac markers because their sensitivity is not high in the early hours after an infarct.
