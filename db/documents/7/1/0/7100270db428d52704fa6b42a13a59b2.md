The most common upper extremity fractures presenting to the emergency department are distal radius and ulna injuries. Distal ulnar fractures have historically not had a clear consensus on management compared to their distal radius counterparts. While most distal ulnar fractures are nonoperative, failure to adequately address these varied and often complex injuries can lead to poor outcomes. The aim is to provide the interprofessional team with a better understanding of distal ulna fractures and their management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical demographics and fracture types that present with distal ulna fractures.
- Describe the impact of distal ulna fractures on wrist stability.
- Explain when surgical intervention on distal ulna fractures is indicated.
- Review the complications of distal ulna fractures.
