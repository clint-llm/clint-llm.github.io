The corrugator supercilii muscles consist of two heads. The transverse head arises from the superomedial margin of the orbital rim and inserts into the dermis at the middle third of the brow and interdigitates with the orbicularis oculi and frontalis muscles. The smaller oblique head runs parallel to the depressor supercilii after inserting into the medial brow.

The corrugator supercilii muscles work with other muscles of the glabellar complex, including the procerus, depressor supercilii, and the orbicularis oculi muscles, to maintain a balanced brow position and shape.
