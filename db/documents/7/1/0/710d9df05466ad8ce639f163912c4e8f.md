Mortality rates for HOCM have improved but still, range from 1-6%. Sudden death is the most common cause of death in young people. Studies show that midventricular obstruction is associated with a high risk of apical aneurysm formation, cardiac symptoms, and sudden death compared to patients who did not have the midventricular obstruction.

Death is often sudden and typically associated with a sporting activity. Screening of first degree relatives is now done to identify individuals at high risk for death. Patients with HOCM may develop a variety of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Heart failure is likely in patients with severe diastolic dysfunction. The condition is progressive and eventually, all patients will develop symptoms.
