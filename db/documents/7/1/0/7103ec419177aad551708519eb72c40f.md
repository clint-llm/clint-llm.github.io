Gastric lymphoma is most commonly found in the gastric antrum, and the gold standard for diagnosis is upper endoscopy with biopsies, tissue analysis by trained pathologists, and immunohistochemistry. Endoscopically, gastric lymphoma can present as ulcers, heterogeneous masses, or a combination of ulcers and masses in multiple locations at various stages. Once diagnosed, a CT scan with IV and PO contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are obtained to assist with staging. Endoscopic ultrasound is often used to evaluate the depth of invasion, peri-gastric lymph node involvement, and staging of disease but is not required for diagnosis.  Diagnosing H. pylori is an important component when diagnosing gastric lymphomas as it is present in up to 90% of cases, and eradication is an important part of treatment. Non-invasive and invasive tests exist for H. pylori, and a patient should have two negative tests before considering them uninfected.

PET-CT scans have been used to localize regions for biopsy in certain scenarios but are not required for diagnosis.  Bone marrow biopsies are not required in primary gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Complete blood counts with flow cytometry, renal function, liver function, protein electrophoresis, serum lactate dehydrogenase, Beta-2 microglobulin, hepatitis serologies, and HIV serology are the necessary labs in the initial workup of a patient diagnosed with gastric lymphoma.
