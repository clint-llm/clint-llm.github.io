Projects should be targeted at specific, quantifiable patient care or operational outcomes. Projects should be designed in line with institutional interests, values, and key stakeholders. Failure to understand these interests and institutional political dimensions can result in the failure of the project.

Outcomes should be measured through definable metrics designated as primary and secondary. Primary metrics are measurements of the outcome sought. Secondary metrics ensure that the error or deficiency is not changed to a new problem through the interventions of the project. For example, if the primary metric is to have more patients seen each day in a clinic, a reasonable secondary metric would be the number of patient care errors that occur. This ensures that deficiencies are improved through the changes made and not just transitioned into a new deficiency.

Many CQI initiatives focus on improving one or more areas. Common CQI goals include:

- Cost reduction

- Decreased appointment wait time

- Reduced in-department wait time

- Higher patient volume

- Decreased cycle time

- Reducing defects

- Increased patient and/or staff safety

- Increased patient and/or staff satisfaction
