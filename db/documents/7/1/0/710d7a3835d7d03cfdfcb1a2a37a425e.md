The main arterial supply to the abdominal wall comes from the epigastric arteries. There are three epigastric arteries supply the abdominal wall—superior, inferior, and superficial epigastric arteries. The superficial epigastric artery supplies the superficial tissue of the abdominal wall; the superior and inferior epigastric arteries make an anastomosis with each other and supply the muscles of the abdominal wall.
