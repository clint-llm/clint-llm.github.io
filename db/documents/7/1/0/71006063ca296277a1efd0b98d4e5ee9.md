Lumbosacral spondylolisthesis is the forward translation of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5) over the first sacral vertebra (S1). Bilateral L5 pars defect (spondylolysis) or repetitive stress injury is the primary etiology behind lumbosacral spondylolisthesis. The degree of a slip often correlates with the degree of symptoms.

The prevalence of spondylolysis (pars defect), in the general population, is 6%, and a third of those will subsequently develop a degree of spondylolisthesis.

The most commonly affected populations are children and adolescents participating in sports that require repetitive lower back hyperextension (divers, pace cricket bowlers, baseball, softball, rugby, weightlifting, sailing, table tennis, wrestlers, gymnasts, dancers, and footballers). They usually present with lower back pain exacerbated by activity.

Management of the majority of the cases is non-operative, but patients who fail non-operative treatment and continue having disabling symptoms may require surgical treatment.
