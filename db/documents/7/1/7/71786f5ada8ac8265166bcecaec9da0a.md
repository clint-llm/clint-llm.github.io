As the complexity of patients and their comorbidities nowadays increase, the management of infections poses an increasing clinical dilemma. This chapter highlights the application of different nuclear medicine techniques in the evaluation and workup of infectious foci. Modern nuclear medicine practice uses advanced SPECT-CT and PET-CT hybrid imaging techniques to evaluate infections. This activity will review the various indications, techniques, and radiopharmaceuticals used by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review different radiopharmaceuticals used clinically to evaluate infections.
- Outline the impact of SPECT-CT techniques.
- Explain the use of FDG PET in cardiovascular device infections.
- Describe the use of Fluoride PET scans versus FDG PET scans in the evaluation of bony infections.
