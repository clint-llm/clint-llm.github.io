Interstitial fibrosis is regarded as the principal pathogenic mechanism of asbestosis. It is believed that after deposition and transmigration of asbestos fibers in the lung, there is an accumulation of macrophages followed by fibroblasts that lay the foundation for fibrosis. Reactive oxygen species produced by immune cells and phagocytes in response to asbestos fibers result in oxidative injury. These reactive oxygen species and transepithelial migration of fibers injure the type 1 alveolar cells. Injured epithelial cells also produce fibroblast growth factor-beta, which induces fibrosis. In an attempt to phagocytose the foreign body, macrophages produce inflammatory mediators such as tissue necrosis factors, interleukins, and stimulation of the phospholipase C pathway.

As this is a progressive disease, fibrosis increase over time. Asbestos fibers also activate serum complement C5a, a chemotactic factor for macrophages.

A recent investigation revealed that the length of fibers has a direct relation to pathogenesis. Longer fibers are more potent than shorter fibers in stimulating the NF-kB pathway and gene promoter activity.
