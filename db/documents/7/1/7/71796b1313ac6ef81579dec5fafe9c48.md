Neuroimaging techniques had helped to uncover the pathophysiology of many tremors.

Several other circuits have been associated with the tremor, including the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, dentatorubro-olivary pathways, and the cerebellothalamic system. Physician-scientists propose that a "two-hit" lesion that includes the nigrostriatal and other regions, as mentioned, is necessary to produce the symptoms.

Most injuries are irreversible, but reversible cases of Holmes tremor had been reported after the resolution ofÂ spontaneous intracranial hypotension
