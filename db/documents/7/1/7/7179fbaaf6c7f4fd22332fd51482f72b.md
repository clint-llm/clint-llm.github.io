Death is mainly due to sepsis and multiorgan failure. Contributing causes are:

- Gastrointestinal bleeding

- Pulmonary embolism

- Myocardial infarction and pulmonary edema

People who have survived Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis must avoid the causative drug or structurally related medicines as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis may recur. Cross-reactions can occur between:

- Anticonvulsants carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine and phenobarbital

- Beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin, cephalosporin, and carbapenem

- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

- Sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine

Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis survivors may have scarring. Severe consequences can include:

- Ocular sequelae: dry eye, photophobia, pain, symblepharon, corneal scarring or neovascularization, trichiasis, reduced visual acuity, and blindness

- Cutaneous scarring, depigmentation, development of new melanocytic nevi, and pruritus

- Nail dystrophy, onycholysis, and loss of nails (this may recover over time)

- Diffuse scalp hair thinning

- Oral complications: discomfort, dry mouth, periodontal disease, gingival inflammation, synechiae

- Esophageal strictures

- Vulvovaginal stenosis or occlusion in females and phimosis in males

- Persistent pulmonary disease: bronchitis, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, organizing pneumonia, respiratory tract obstruction
