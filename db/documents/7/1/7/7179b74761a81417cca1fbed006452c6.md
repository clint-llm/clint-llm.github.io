Magnesium toxicity is commonly caused by the overuse of magnesium-containing medication or under-excretion of magnesium by the kidneys. Early recognition, as well as a high index of suspicion, is critical when diagnosing magnesium toxicity before the onset of fatal complications such as hypotension, respiratory paralysis, and cardiac arrest. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of magnesium toxicity and highlights the interprofessional healthcare team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for developing magnesium toxicity.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with magnesium toxicity.
- Review the management options available for magnesium toxicity.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with magnesium toxicity.
