**Stage 1**

A normal patient will show a normal level of cobalamin in urine upon administration of the oral dose. If the urine level is abnormal, it can be from either an absorption defect in the terminal ileum or a lack of intrinsic factor.

Excreting 8% to 40% of the radioactive vitamin B12 in the urine within 24 hours is consideredÂ a normal finding. The values, however, may fluctuate between laboratories.**Stage 2**

If the abnormal result of stage 1 improves with intrinsic factor administration, it means that the patient has intrinsic factor deficiency. If the patient still has a low urine level of cobalamin, then there is an absorption defect in the terminal ileum, and further tests should be done to investigate.
