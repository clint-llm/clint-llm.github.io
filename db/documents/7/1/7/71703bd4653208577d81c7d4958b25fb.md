**History**

Question patient for potential clues regarding:

- Previous episodes of GI bleeding

- Past medical history relevant to potential bleeding sources (e.g., varices, portal hypertension, alcohol abuse, tobacco abuse, ulcers, H.pylori, diverticulitis, hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease)

- Comorbid conditions that could affect management

- Contributory or confounding medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, bismuth, iron)

- Symptoms associated with bleeding (e.g., painless vs. painful, trouble swallowing, unintentional weight loss, preceding emesis or retching, change in bowel habits)

**Physical**

- Look for signs of hemodynamic instability:

- Resting tachycardia — associated with the loss of less than 15% total blood volume
- Orthostatic hypotension — carries an association with the loss of approximately 15% total blood volume
- Supine hypotension — associated with the loss of approximately 40% total blood volume

- Abdominal pain may raise suspicion for perforation or ischemia.

- A rectal exam is important for the evaluation of:

- Anal fissures
- Hemorrhoids
- Anorectal mass
- Stool exam
