Evaluation of a patient with suspected Sjogren syndrome should include an evaluation of oral and ocular dryness and function. In addition to the history, this may include the performance of a Schirmer test, slit-lamp exam with vital dye staining, salivary flow rate, and/or nuclear scintigraphic evaluation of the salivary glandular function. Assessment of autoantibodies (ANA, RF, SS-A, and SS-B) should also be performed. Of these, SS-A is probably the most sensitive and specific antibody for Sjogren's but alone is not diagnostic since it may be present in other autoimmune disorders and may be absent in up to aÂ third of Sjogren cases. The most specific single test is a minor salivary gland (lip) biopsy which will demonstrate FLS in positive specimens.
