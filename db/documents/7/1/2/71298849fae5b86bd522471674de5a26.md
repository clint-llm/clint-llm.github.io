Differential diagnoses of the red, painful eye include intraocular foreign body, ruptured globe, corneal or scleral laceration, corneal abrasion, infectious keratoconjunctivitis, uveitis, and superficial ocular foreign body. A focused history and physical exam will allow the clinician to differentiate chemical ocular injury from these other diagnoses.
