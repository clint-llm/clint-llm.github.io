TRC is a rare disorder and difficult to manage. It is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an ophthalmologist, neurologist, infectious disease expert, internist, and specialty trained ophthalmology nurse. Patients who are immunosuppressed usually need long term treatment and follow up. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on preventive measures such as avoiding areas frequented by cats, especially sand or dirt in gardens or playgrounds, as well as litter boxes. Patients with active disease should routinely clean fruits and vegetables, as well as wash hands after contact with soil and cat litter boxes. The prognosis of patients with TRC is guarded.
