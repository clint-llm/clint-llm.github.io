Argyria is considered a permanent, irreversible skin condition.

Recently, a few studies have documented the temporary improvement of cosmesis after laser treatments. One study highlights the use of Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy and its utility in the removal of very dark pigmented tattoos. It was thought that this could be utilized in an attempt to reduce the gray and blue pigmentation in patients with argyria. However, the study found that the fluence of this particular laser therapy is too high for argyria, and it induced pinpoint bleeding and marked pain.

However, when a low-fluence 1064-nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser using a top-hat mode was utilized, there was documentation of successful resolution of discoloration following seven treatments.
