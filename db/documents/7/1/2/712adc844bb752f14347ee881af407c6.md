Vaginal atrophy can be a common issue for all women. However, it shows much more prevalence among the postmenopausal population. Reports show that 15% of the female population experiences symptoms of vaginal atrophy before menopause, whereas 40% to 57% of postmenopausal women have symptoms. Menopause causes a dramatic 95% reduction in estrogen production.

Approximately 70% of women with signs and symptoms do not discuss the issue with their provider.

Although most typically seen in postmenopausal women, there are additional risk factors that can contribute to decreased estrogen levels and early symptom onset. These are women who have bilateral oophorectomy, primary ovarian insufficiency, ovarian failure due to radiation or arterial embolization, hypothalamic-pituitary disorders, take anti-estrogen medications such as leuprolide or danazol used commonly for endometriosis, and postpartum breastfeeding mothers. Also at risk are breast cancer survivors suffering from consequences from treatment such as chemotherapy or aromatase inhibitors.
