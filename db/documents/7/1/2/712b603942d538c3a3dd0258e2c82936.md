**Considerations**

- Anesthesia risk

- Bone demineralization

- Cardiopulmonary disease

- Disability

**Anesthesia Risk:**Patients with muscular dystrophy tend to do poorly after the administration of general anesthetic and will require intensive postoperative observation.

**Bone Demineralization:**Osteopenia and osteoporosis due to decreased mobilization and immobilization; this can give rise to fractures and scoliosis.

**Cardiopulmonary Disease:**Frequent follow-up to eliminate secondary complications such as cardiopulmonary disease or cardiac failure due to cardiomyopathy.

**Disability: **Disability and dependence on walking aids like wheelchairs due to muscular injuries and contractures.
