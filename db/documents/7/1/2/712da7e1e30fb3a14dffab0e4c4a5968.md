The word "thenar" means fleshy mounds. In human anatomy, the word thenar associates with the two fleshy mounds located in the palmar surface of the hand. These thenar mounds are called the thenar eminence and the hypothenar eminence. The thenar eminence is the fleshy mound at the base of the thumb. The hypothenar eminence is the mound located at the base of the fifth digit (little finger).

The eminences at either side of the hand are made up of muscles. The muscles located in the thenar eminence function primarily to control the thumb. The muscles that reside in the hypothenar eminence will contract and manifest motion through the little finger.

The hypothenar eminence is made up of four muscles, but there are only three primary muscles. The four muscles are the abductor digiti minimi muscle, the flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle, the opponens digiti minimi muscle, and the palmaris brevis muscle. All these muscles contract and create specific movements to the little finger.
