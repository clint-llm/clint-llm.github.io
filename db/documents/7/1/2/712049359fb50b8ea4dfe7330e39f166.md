Obstetric injury; severe trauma caused by falls, direct, blunt blows, or high-speed motor vehicle collisions; penetrating injury; forceful traction injury; and compression injury can all result in damage to the brachial plexus. Upper trunk traction injuries occur when the head and neck are violently pulled caudally from the shoulder and torso. Similarly, lower trunk traction injuries occur when the arm is violently abducted above the head.
