Quantitative platelet disorders (i.e., thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis) is readily diagnosable using light microscopy, while qualitative disorders are more difficult, especially given the small size of typical platelets. Though platelets are too small for detailed assessment via light microscopy, some basic evaluations are possible in terms of size and morphology.

Large platelets are usually the result of megakaryocyte hyperactivity. Younger (larger) reticulated platelets can be produced more quickly, and so might be seen in the conditions where there is increased demand for platelet production. Large platelets are also present in some inherited conditions, where platelets as big as a typical red blood cell may be visible.

In the diagnosis of suspected inherited platelet disorders, diagnostic protocols have undergone development which involves initial assessment via traditional blood film with light microscopy, followed by more specific testing guided by the blood film findings. For example, if a blood film demonstrates large platelets, targeted immunofluorescence testing may be carried out against glycoprotein Ib (absence of which may indicate a diagnosis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome) or filamin 1A (absence of which may indicate filamin A-related thrombocytopenia). Normal-sized platelets can be tested for surface GPIIb/IIIa, which is lacking in Glanzmann thrombasthenia. β1-tubulin can also be visualized via immunofluorescence in small platelets, with abnormal bent forms of the protein indicating Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome or X-linked thrombocytopenia.
