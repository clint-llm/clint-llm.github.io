Oxygen toxicity can cause a variety of complications affecting multiple organ systems.  CNS complications primarily include tonic-clonic convulsions and amnesia.  Pulmonary sequelae range from mild tracheobronchitis and absorptive atelectasis to diffuse alveolar damage that is indistinguishable from ARDS.  Ocular complications consist of reversible myopia, delayed cataract formation, and in children, retrolental fibroplasia.  Serous otitis media and dysbaric osteonecrosis have also been observed.  In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), status asthmaticus, weakness of the respiratory muscles (e.g., from polyneuritis, poliomyelitis, or myasthenia gravis) and in those with central respiratory depression from narcotic poisoning, head injury, or raised intracranial tension, oxygen toxicity can cause carbon dioxide narcosis secondary to a loss in the hypoxemic drive and decrease in ventilation
