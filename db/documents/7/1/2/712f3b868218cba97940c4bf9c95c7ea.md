Early studies focused primarily on anatomic abnormalities identified at the time of exploratory surgery. An improved understanding of disorders/etiologies has grown with improvements in technology and imaging studies affecting the preoperative approach to these patients. Post-cholecystectomy syndrome may result from organic or functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and can be further classified based on the origin of symptoms

- Most commonly, practitioners overlook extrabiliary disordersÂ like reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, IBS, or pancreatitis as causes of post-cholecystectomy syndrome

- Primarily reported extrabiliary causes to include gastrointestinal causes like pancreatitis and its complications, pancreatic tumors, hepatitis, esophageal diseases, mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis, and peptic ulcer disease

- However, biliary etiologies known to cause post-cholecystectomy syndrome include such as bile salt-induced diarrhea, retained calculi, bile leak, biliary strictures, cystic duct remnant, stenosis, and dyskinesia of the sphincter of Oddi

- Extra-intestinal causes like psychiatric and neurologic disorders, intercostal neuritis, wound neuroma, coronary artery disease, and unexplained pain syndromes can also cause symptoms consistent with post-cholecystectomy syndrome
