The first step in managing pulseless electrical activity is to begin chest compressions according to the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol followed by administrating epinephrine every 3 to 5 minutes, while simultaneously looking for any reversible causes. Once a diagnosis is made, begin immediate, specific management, i.e., decompression of pneumothorax, pericardial drain for tamponade, fluids infusion for hypovolemia, correction of body temperature for hypothermia, administration of thrombolytics for myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. An arterial blood gas and serum electrolytes should be obtained during the resuscitation process.

Epinephrine should be administered in 1 mg doses intravenously (IV)/intraosseously (IO) every 3 to 5 minutes during pulseless electrical activity arrest. Each dose should be followed by 20 ml of flush and elevating the arm for 10 to 20 seconds for better perfusion. Higher doses of epinephrine have not been shown to improve survival or neurologic outcomes in most patients. Selected patients, like those with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers overdose, may benefit from higher-dose epinephrine. It can also be given via an endotracheal tube after mixing 2 mg in 10 ml of normal saline.

If the detected rhythm is bradycardia that is associated with hypotension, then atropine (1 mg IV every 3-5 min, up to three doses) should be administered. This is considered the optimal dose, beyond which no further benefit will occur. Note that atropine may cause pupillary dilation; therefore, this sign cannot be used to assess neurologic function.

Sodium bicarbonate may be used only in patients with severe, systemic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or tricarboxylic acid overdose. The dose is 1 mEq/kg. Avoid routine administration of sodium bicarbonate as it worsens intracellular and intracerebral acidosis without affecting mortality.

Pericardial drainage and emergent surgery may be lifesaving in appropriate patients with pulseless electrical activity. In a patient with a refractory case and chest trauma, a thoracotomy may be performed. Near pulseless electrical activity or a very low-output state may also be managed with circulatory assistance (e.g., intra-aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and ventricular assist device).

The chances of a successful outcome depend on a very coordinated resuscitation process. There should be a specific person responsible for specific steps and a good team leader.
