Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome is a rare ocular condition characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).

The precipitating factor that leads to Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome is thought to be caused by a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with a retinal break, most commonly in the periphery near the ora serrata or non-pigmented epithelium of the pars plana or pars plicata.

Symptoms can range from unilateral eye pain and decreased visual acuity to peripheral vision loss secondary to increased IOP and RRD. A triad of aqueous cells in the anterior chamber, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and elevated intraocular pressure is required for the diagnosis of Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome.
