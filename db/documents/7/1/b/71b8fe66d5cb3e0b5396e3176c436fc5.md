Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a sinus tract between the main stem, lobar, or segmental bronchus and the pleural space. It can be a potentially catastrophic complication following pneumonectomy or other pulmonary resection. Morbidity ranges between 25% and 71%, and diagnosis and management is often a challenge for physicians.

Treatment for BPF ranges from medical management to bronchoscopic procedures for critically ill patients and surgical intervention for those deemed at the highest risk. There is a lack of consensus regarding optimal management due to varying therapeutic success. Varoli et al. described the time of onset following surgical intervention to classify fistulas as early (1 to 7 days), intermediate (8 to 30 days), or late (more than 30 days).
