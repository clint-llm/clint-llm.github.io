An epidural blood patch (EBP) is a procedure in which a small volume of autologous blood is injected into a patient's epidural space to stop a leak of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This leak of CSF is thought to decrease CSF pressure, particularly when the patient is upright, allowing for increased cerebral blood flow via vasodilation producing a characteristic post-dural puncture headache (PDPH or "a spinal headache"). This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and complications of an epidural blood patch and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with a post-dural puncture headache.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how an epidural blood patch works.
- Review the indications for an epidural blood patch.
- Summarize the technique of administering the epidural blood patch.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with a post-dural puncture headache.
