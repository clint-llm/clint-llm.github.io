Patients should be educated regarding the signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia, which include lethargy, confusion, gait abnormalities, and vomiting. Education regarding medication compliance is vital. This is especially important for patients of cirrhosis.Â Diet plans should be provided individually to patients, and emphasis should be placed on important dietary restrictions at each visit. Information regarding specific dietary supplements should be provided. Patients should be informed that exercise is not completely restricted, and caloric intake should be increased to avoid protein breakdown in patients who wish to follow an active lifestyle. In children with urea cycle defects, growth and development should be monitored on each visit, and parents should be guided accordingly. Families with an infant diagnosed with urea cycle disorder should be informed of the availability of antenatal tests for diagnosis.
