Amniocentesis is the aspiration of amniotic fluid from the amniotic cavity and is the most common invasive fetal testing procedure. Amniocentesis is an invasive technique. It is usually performed to diagnose or exclude fetal aneuploidy or other fetal genetic, biochemical or infectious risks. Prenatal diagnosis enables the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of chromosomal abnormalities, gene disorders, X-linked conditions, neural tube defects, and infections to be made before the birth of the fetus. The indications grow with progress in these fields. This activity outlines the procedure, reviews its complication rates, describes the complexity of obtaining truly informed consent, and examines the role of the healthcare team in improving care for high-risk patients who undergo this invasive procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common indications and contraindications of performing amniocentesis.
- Describe the equipment required, the technique used, and the patient preparation needed for obtaining valid informed consent and performing an amniocentesis.
- Outline and review the possible complications associated with amniocentesis. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies for obtaining informed consent, care coordination, and communication needed to improve clinical outcomes.
