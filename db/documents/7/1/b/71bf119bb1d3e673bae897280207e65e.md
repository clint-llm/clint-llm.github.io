Patients with afferent loop syndrome may presentÂ with acute or chronic complaints. Most cases of acute afferent loop syndrome occur within the early postoperative period. These patients will report a sudden onset of abdominal pain, often with nausea and vomiting. There may be localized tenderness in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium and involuntary guarding. Palpation may reveal an upper abdominal mass. Jaundice may reflect biliary obstruction. Severe cases will demonstrate signs of peritonitis and septic shock.

Chronic afferent loop syndrome presents months to years after the surgery. Often, the patient will report postprandial midabdominal discomfort. Weight loss is common and multifactorial. Patients may develop an aversion to eating secondary to pain, while bacterial overgrowth may result in malabsorption.
