Imaging studies like CT scan and MRI can be done during diagnosis and follow up. Imaging can determine the extent of the tumor, which organs are infiltrated, and a surgical resectionÂ plan.

- Histological evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis. An incisional biopsy is preferred, but a careful biopsy may be sufficient. Histological features are as previously described in histopathology.

- Immunostaining with vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, muscle actin, and desmin are helpful in distinguishing the tumors.

- The use of NGS is recommended by most guidelines.
