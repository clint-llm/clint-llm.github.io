Myopia is a common refractive disorder where the focal convergence of light that passes through the cornea and the lens falls short of the fovea, resulting in nearsightedness. One cause of myopia is the axial elongation of the globe, which results in the straining of the retina. High myopia, which is approximately an error of refraction between -6.0 to -8.0 diopters, is a risk factor for retinal detachment and is common in Eastern Asia.

Ocular albinism is an X-linked disorder where there is hypopigmentation of the fundus that often presents with congenital nystagmus, iris translucency, severely reduced visual acuity and strabismus.
