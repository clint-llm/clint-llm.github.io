The central nervous system (CNS) derives from a subspecialized ectoderm called the neuroectoderm. Over two to eight weeks of embryological development, notochord causes the evolution of the neural plate. The neural plate eventually differentiates into the neural tube via neurulation, which eventually forms the central nervous system. The brain forms from the cranial two-thirds, and the spinal cord forms from the caudal one-third of the neural tube.
