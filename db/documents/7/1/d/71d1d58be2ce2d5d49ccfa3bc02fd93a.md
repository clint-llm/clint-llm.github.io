Descriptions of pathological features of corneal transplant rejection result from the examination of replaced grafts following irreversible failure.

In penetrating keratoplasty, the rejection starts as a thin line adjacent to the limbal vessels and then migrates across the graft host junction. This line comprises lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. This faint line can slowly progress to endothelial rejection in a few days to weeks.

**Epithelial Rejection**

The epithelial rejection shows the leukocytes and lymphocytes when examined under light and electron microscope. A lot of disorganized cells can be observed on the graft.

**Subepithelial Rejection**

Subepithelial rejection is caused by a deep-seated infiltrate and rejection by stromal keratocytes.

**Stromal Rejection**

In hyperacute stromal rejection, there is a predominance of monocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and plasma cells external to endothelial capillaries. The stromal keratocyte architecture is altered due to lymphocyte infiltration. Capillary vessel formation is seen in the anterior and mid stroma with a predominance of immunoblast-like cells.

**Endothelial Rejection**

Long and round cells with loss of cell junctions. Damage to the cells near the graft host junction and dense mononuclear infiltration resulting in replacement of damaged cells adjacent to the endothelium. Fibroblasts and altered endothelial cells form a sheet over the Descemet membrane.
