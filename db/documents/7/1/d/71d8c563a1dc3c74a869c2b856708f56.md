Pyramidal tract lesions can occur from any type of damage to the brain or spinal cord. They can result from a variety of injuries and diseases such as strokes, abscesses, tumors, hemorrhage, meningitis, multiple sclerosis, or trauma. Damage to the corticospinal tract will present similarly to upper motor lesion syndrome and will present with symptoms such as spasticity, clonus, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign. Damage to the corticobulbar tract can present with pseudobulbar palsy or damage to cranial nerves VII or X.

**Pseudo-bulbar Palsy**

The corticobulbar tract bilaterally innervates most of the cranial nerves, except VII and XII, which means that for symptoms to arise from damage to these nerves, both sides of the corticobulbar tract must be injured as is the case in pseudo-bulbar palsy. Symptoms in this condition may include slow speech, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking), spastic tongue, and pseudobulbar affect (uncontrollable episodes of laughing or crying).

**Cranial Nerve VII or X Lesion**

Unilateral lesions to either of these nerves will cause contralateral symptoms. Since cranial nerve VII innervates muscles of the lower face, damage to this nerve will cause deviation of angle of mouth towardsÂ the opposite side of the lesion due to the overaction of the muscles of the opposite side. Similarly, damage to cranial nerve X will lead to the deviation of the uvula to the opposite side of the lesion.
