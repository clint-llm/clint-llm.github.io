Embryonic development is a complex process requiring billions of cells to function in unison to form a single living organism. This intricate process necessitates all of these cells to communicate with one another. Many signaling pathways are involved in this dynamic process. Studies have shown that proteins expressed by the WNT gene family are important messengers involved in embryonic development, cell migration, cell fate determination, and cell polarity. These genes are code for glycoproteins that interact with specific types of GPCRs: the frizzled receptors.
