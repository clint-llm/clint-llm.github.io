**Hypomagnesemia**

If magnesium depletion is the cause of hypocalcemia, effective therapy requires the repletion of magnesium stores. Until magnesium levels are normal, treatment with calcium will only temporarily improve the serum calcium.

**Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia**

Patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia due to an activating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor often have mild hypocalcemia and are asymptomatic. This genetic disorder increases urine calcium excretion, placing such individuals at high risk of nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis when treated with vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Therefore, practitioners shouldÂ only consider treatment for symptomatic patients, and the calcium increased only to a point where symptoms are alleviated.
