The most common causes of argyria are secondary to exposures in the workplace or medicinal use. Jewelers, silver miners, silversmiths, and photograph developers are frequently exposed to compounds containing silver.

Medicinal exposure has become much less common in the modern-day era since the antimicrobial properties of silver are unavailing when compared to today's antibiotics. As a result, there are minimal FDA-approved medicinal uses for products containing silver in the United States.

-  Ophthalmic silver nitrate for gonorrheal ophthalmia neonatorum

-  Cutaneous silver nitrate for mucosal cautery

-  Cutaneous silver sulfadiazine for wounds secondary to second and third-degree burns

-  Mucocutaneous silver acetate for smoking cessation because of its foul, metallic taste when combined with smoke

-  Silver impregnated catheters and endotracheal tubes as an antimicrobial adjunct.

Despite the dwindling medicinal uses, there is still a market for colloidal silver as a cure-all in alternative and homeopathic medicine.
