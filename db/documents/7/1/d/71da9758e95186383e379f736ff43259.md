The diagnosis and management of organophosphate poisoning are done with an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department physician, poison control, nurse practitioner, anesthesiologist, intensivist, and other specialists depending on organ system involvement. The key is to prevent further absorption via the skin, eyes, or lungs. The pharmacist must ensure that the patient is on no other medication that can exacerbate the cholinergic crises. In addition, the pharmacist should be aware that in organophosphate toxicity, hundreds of milligrams of atropine may be required.

The treatment should follow the trauma protocol with the first emphasis on the airways. Symptomatic patients need to be monitored in the ICU. Both atropine and pralidoxime can be used in symptomatic patients but close monitoring is necessary. The outlook for most patients is excellent.
