Although field intubation has been part of a prehospital provider’s scope of practice for some time, there persists a higher complication rate with prehospital intubation than in the in-hospital setting.  The most catastrophic of these complications are the result of misplaced ET tubes, which can lead to hypoxia and a patient's death.  Misplaced endotracheal tubes were found to occur 25% of the time in a study by Katz and Falk in a cohort of 108 field intubations.

- Dental injury

- Vocal cord injury

- Laryngeal injury

- Tracheal injury

- False passage creation

- Vomiting

- Aspiration

- Pneumonia

- Barotrauma

- Autonomic instability

- Hypoxia

Special note should be made of complications that can arise in the peri- and post-intubation phases of the procedure.  Dunford et al. examined a subset of patients from the San Diego Rapid Sequence Intubation Trial, which looked at the incidence of transient hypoxia and pulse rate reactivity during field intubations.
