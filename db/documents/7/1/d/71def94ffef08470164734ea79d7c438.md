**CAMT**

CAMT generally presents with severe thrombocytopenia within the first month of life or even earlier in the fetal period, which can manifest as petechiae, intracranial bleeds, recurrent rectal bleeding, or pulmonary hemorrhage.

A family history of thrombocytopenia may be present.

**AAMT**

AAMT is a diagnosis of exclusion, and patients usually present with bleeding complications not responding to standard treatment for immune thrombocytopenia like steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.
