Before any regional anesthetic procedure, a complete checklist assessment should be performed. An assessment of the patient's comorbidities should be performed beforehand, including medical history, physical examination with assessment of the respiratory tract, and analysis of preoperative tests.

Before obtaining informed consent from the patient, the anesthesiologist is required to inform them of the risks and benefits of TPVB and the potential complications.

A clinic specializing in regional anesthesia is recommended to perform the nerve block to ensure optimal monitoring of the patients' vitals. This monitoring includes pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, and blood pressure, as described in the standards of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.
