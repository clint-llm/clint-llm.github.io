It can be challenging to treat pigmented purpuric dermatoses. If a medication reaction is causative, the eruption should clear with discontinuation of the drug. Due to the possible etiology of vascular hypertension and venous stasis of the lower extremities, compression stockings are recommended. A study of three patients with pigmented purpuric dermatitis revealed clearance of this eruption after 4 weeks of treatment with the bioflavonoid, rutoside 50 mg 2 times per day, and ascorbic acid 500 mg 2 times per day.

Other case reports of patients with pigmented purpuric dermatitis showed improvement with colchicine 0.5 mg 2 times per day, minocycline, methotrexate, and pentoxifylline 400 mg 3 times per day.
