Gemfibrozil helps manage hypertriglyceridemia and is comparatively effective and safe. It is essential to enhance healthcare providers' knowledge about this drug, including nurses and pharmacists.Â They must advise the patient that the medication can potentially produce dangerous side effects like diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, hyperkalemia, myopathy, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring renal and liver parameters in patients using this drug is recommended to detect dangerous complications on time. Nursing will be on the front line monitoring for side effects, determining treatment efficiency, and reporting any concerns to the prescribing clinician. Pharmacists should verify the dose regimen, perform medication reconciliation, and report any concerns back to the prescriber. Gemfibrozil demands an interprofessional team strategy among physicians, specialists, physician assistants, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all cooperating beyond expectations to accomplish excellent patient outcomes and prevent complications.
