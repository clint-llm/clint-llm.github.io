The nurse should be available before, during, and after the TAP block to monitor the patient, including:

- Verify that pre-procedure, a crash car is close and available with resuscitative equipment in it.

- Monitor the patient vital signs and clinical status during and after the procedure.

- After the procedure when in the recovery room, the nurse should assess the patient's block site for bleeding, hematoma, or abdominal distension.
