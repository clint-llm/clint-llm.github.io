Most specimens consist of whole blood collected via the appropriate protocol for hematologic studies, typically in a lavender top tube with potassium EDTA anticoagulant. A peripheral blood smear is then made from the specimen and prepared with Wright-Giemsa stain for light microscopy. Bone marrow aspirate with Wright-Giemsa staining may also demonstrate this histologic finding.
