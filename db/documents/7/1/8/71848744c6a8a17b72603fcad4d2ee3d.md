OGs are uncommon, with an incidence of 0.2 per 100,000 people and are the third most common primary brain neoplasm after glioblastoma and diffuse astrocytoma. OGs comprise approximately 5% of all primary CNS tumors.

OGs have a slight bimodal distribution but are predominantly an adult neoplasm with a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades and a smaller peak of tumor incidence that occurs in children 6Â to 12 years of age.
