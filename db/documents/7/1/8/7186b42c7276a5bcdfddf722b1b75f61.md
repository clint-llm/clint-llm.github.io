Several techniques may be useful to calculate the absolute number of CD4 T lymphocytes. The gold standard is immunofluorescence analysis by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry uses fluorochrome labels probes that bind to specific components of the cells. For CD4 cell count, the CD4 T lymphocytes are stained with fluorescent labels that are detectable in the flow cytometer. Monoclonal antibodies bind to the CD4 receptor on the surface of T cells. The relative percentage of cells expressing the receptor on its surface is obtained from the flow cytometer. In other words, the reporting of the results is as CD4 percentages, and the absolute number is obtained by multiplying the percentage, and the total white cell count. For example, a CD4 percentage greater than 29% is equivalent to an absolute CD4 cell count greater than 500 cells/mm^3, and a percentage lower than 14% is equivalent to an absolute CD4 count lower than 200 cells/mm^3.

There are alternative systems manufactured by various companies that are options. It is essential to know which technique is in use because absolute count numbers may differ. When using different methods, the analysis of the results requires caution.
