The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history, the dye disappearance test, and slit-lamp examination. Laboratory testing is generally not needed.

The fluorescein dye disappearance test is done prior to dilation. The tear meniscus is examined after 3 to 5 minutes of insertionÂ of 2% fluorescein to check for the presence of the remaining dye. Usually, in punctal stenosis, there is a dye disappearance time of over 5 minutes.

Punctal dilation of the stenotic punctum with a Nettleship dilater is performed after the dilater is lubricated with ointment (Fig 5). Diagnostic canalicular probing and nasolacrimal duct irrigation are performed under topical anesthesia. A punctal finder is used to dilate the punctum, and a canalicular probe is inserted. A soft stop indicates canalicular obstruction, and a hard stop against the lacrimal bone indicates a patent canalicular system. Irrigation is performed with a 5ml normal saline syringe. In a normal system, there is the passage of free fluid into the nose or nasopharynx without reflux.

Fluorescein dye disappearance after dilation is then performed. The normal flow would show fluorescein disappearance in under 3 minutes.
