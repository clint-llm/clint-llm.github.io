A medication administration route is often classified by the location at which the drug is applied, such as oral or intravenous. The choice of routes in which the medications are applied depends not only on convenience but also on the drug's properties and pharmacokinetics. Therefore it is crucial to understand the characteristics of the various routes and associated techniques. Many interprofessional healthcare team members are involved in administering medications to patients. Each medication administration route has unique contraindications, and the healthcare team members need to recognize them. This activity describes medication administration routes and explains the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients who undergo medication administration.
