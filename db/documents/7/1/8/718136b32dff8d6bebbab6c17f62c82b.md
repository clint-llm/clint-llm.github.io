Pulmonary nocardiosis and disseminated forms of the infection are opportunistic diseases occurring mainly in patients deficient in T cell-mediated immunity. Patients with the greatest susceptibility to this include those with solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, HIV-infected patients, patients taking corticosteroids chronically, or patients with ongoing malignant processes. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis may occur in immunocompetent patients who have experienced a direct inoculation of the microorganism into the skin structures from a traumatic event. This is seen most commonly in those working in rural areas involving in agricultural activities. While rare, post-surgical wound infections may occur if non-sterile equipment is used. Pulmonary forms of nocardiosis are induced via aerosolized inoculation of the bacterium into the airways. Dissemination throughout the remainder of the body may occur from either of these initial inoculations.

Risk factors for acquiring Nocardia include the following:

- Alcoholism

- Chronic lung disease (esp patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis)

- Solid-organ transplant

- Use of corticosteroids

- Hematological malignancy

- Collagen vascular disease (lupus)

- Renal failure

- Inflammatory bowel disease

- Whipple disease

- HIV
