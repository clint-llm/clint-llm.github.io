Cord ischemia, primarily secondary to vascular insults in the mid-thoracic region, is common as the diameter of the spinal cord and its resulting arteries undergo significant narrowing here. Damage of any kind to the anterior spinal artery can cause significant motor symptoms, as it supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. The majority of the corticospinal tracts responsible for motor function are also affected by insults to the anterior spinal artery. In comparison, ischemia to the posterior spinal artery results in a sensory and proprioceptiveÂ loss due to its supply to the dorsal roots.
