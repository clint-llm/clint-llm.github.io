Morbidity of up to 50% is reported in various studies of which postoperative pancreatic fistulae are bothersome and require prolonged drainage. Though most fistulae are managed with intraoperatively placed drains, if they persist beyond 14 days, then endoscopic retrograde pancreaticography would be diagnostic, and a stent can be placed to decrease the drain output.

Other complications include hemorrhage, which may require an interventional radiology consult or surgical intervention depending on the severity of the bleed.

Up to 20% of patients may be expected to develop new-onset diabetes mellitus after distal pancreatectomy and up to 10% in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.
