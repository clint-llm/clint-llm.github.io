Spontaneous abortion is a pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestational age.

Approximately half of the miscarriages are due to unknown genetic abnormalities.

Alcohol or drug use, infections, chronic disease, environmental exposures, and structural uterine abnormalities are other important risk factors.

Symptoms and signs of early pregnancy loss depend on the type.

Types include missed, threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete, recurrent, and septic.

The evaluation usually involves a thorough history, physical exam, beta-HCG measurement, and pelvic ultrasound.

Although management also depends on the type, expectant, medical, and surgical approaches are generally equally effective.

Only aspirin in the setting of the anti-phospholipid syndrome and supplemental progesterone in the context of recurrent miscarriage have demonstrated the potential for prevention.

Testing for genetic abnormalities and anti-phospholipid syndrome should generally be reserved for cases of recurrent early pregnancy loss.
