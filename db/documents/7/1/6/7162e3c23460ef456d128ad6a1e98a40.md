**Fructosamine**

The most common assay available for fructosamine measurement in serum is the colorimetric-based assay. This assay utilizes the reduction of the dye nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) to formazan. The rate of formazan formation is directly proportional to the fructosamine concentration and is measured with the spectrophotometric technique.

**Glycated Albumin**

There are several different assay methodologies available for the analysis of glycated albumin. These include:

- Enzymatic assay

- High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and affinity chromatography

- Immunoassay, including quantification by radioimmunoassay

- Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

- Enzyme-linked boronate immunoassay (ELBIA)

- Colorimetry

- Electrochemical

The enzymatic assay (Lucica GA-L kit, Asahi Kasei Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) is easier to use, highly accurate, and automated.

The normal value is around 14% and it becomes greater than 17% in diabetes patients. Values in diabetes can go as high as two to five times the upper limit of normal.
