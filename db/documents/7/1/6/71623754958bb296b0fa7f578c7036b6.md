Physostigmine administered via the intravenous route has rapid distribution and plasma elimination; distribution is 2.3 minutes, while elimination half-life is 23 minutes.

There are no recommended routine tests for the use of physostigmine. Monitoring of the effects of physostigmine is possible using EKG and vital signs.

The most significant side effect is a cholinergic crisis, which is avoidable by administering physostigmine at the dosage protocols while keeping contraindications and cautions in mind.
