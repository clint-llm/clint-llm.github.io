The goal is to avoid complications which include:

- Infection

- Rupture into the gastrointestinal tract causing signs and symptoms of bleeding

- Free rupture into the peritoneal cavity causing abdominal pain, peritonitis, or even death

- There have been case reports of large pseudocysts causing increased intra-abdominal pressure, which can present with orthopnoea, dyspnea, abdominal pain, distention, and new organ failure.

- Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm

- Compression of the surrounding structures causing biliary complications or portal hypertension
