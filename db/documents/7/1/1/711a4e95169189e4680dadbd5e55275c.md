Abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood are often due to the unusual assembly, breakdown, or transport of their lipoprotein particles. An increased level of plasma lipoproteins is termed hyperlipoproteinemia, while the decreased level of plasma lipoproteins is termed hypolipoproteinemia.

Levels of plasma lipids are good indicators of the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). For instance, hyperlipoproteinemia is related to a greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, as well as a higher occurrence of ischemic vascular disease and development of fatty deposits under the skin, known as xanthomas and xanthelasmas. Elevated plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL are linked with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and raised plasma triglycerides.  An increase in VLDL is related to a greater prevalence of atherosclerotic heart disease. However, elevated levels of HDL cholesterol may protect against atherosclerotic heart disease, due to its ability to prevent excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the body. There are several types and subtypes of lipid-related disorders and they are described below.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a disorder with high levels of triglycerides in the blood. Five main disorders result in hypertriglyceridemia:

- Familial hypertriglyceridemia: An autosomal dominant disorder that results in elevated VLDL levels in plasma

- Familial combined hyperlipidemia: An autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by the excessive synthesis of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B

- Congenital lipoprotein lipase deficiency: An autosomal recessive disorder, which results in low to no lipoprotein lipase activity; typically, chylomicrons build up in the blood and eruptive xanthomas develop

- Apoprotein CII deficiency: An autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by the lack of apoprotein CII, an essential cofactor for lipoprotein lipase activity; there is usually chylomicron and VLDL accumulation in the plasma

- Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia: A disorder in which there is a defect in apolipoprotein E; due to the buildup of remnant VLDL particles in the blood, there are higher plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride

Hypercholesterolemia is a disorder in which there are high cholesterol levels in the blood. Three main conditions result in hypercholesterolemia:

- Polygenic hypercholesterolemia: The most common disorder to raise cholesterol levels; there are many genes involved that elevate LDL concentration in plasma

- Familial hypercholesterolemia: An autosomal dominant disorder in which the gene for the LDL receptor is defective, so removal of LDL from plasma is less than effective

- Familial combined hyperlipidemia: Discussed previously above

Hyperalphalipoproteinemia is a disorder with elevated HDL levels in the plasma. Most cases are inherited through a dominant or polygenic manner and are linked to a lower risk of coronary artery disease.

High levels of plasma lipids can also be due to dietary factors, such as ingesting excess calories, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol, as well as from medication use.

Hypolipoproteinemia refers to relatively low levels of lipids in the blood. Such a condition may be associated with a genetic component or perhaps other conditions like anemia or an overactive thyroid.

Hypolipoproteinemias include three primary conditions:

- Hypoalphalipoproteinemia: A reduction in HDL cholesterol levels in plasma that is associated with a greater risk of coronary heart disease

- Abetalipoproteinemia: An autosomal recessive disease; it is caused by apoprotein B deficiency and is characterized by the lack of chylomicrons, LDL, and VLDL in the blood

- Tangier disease: An autosomal recessive disorder classified by an absence of plasma HDL, which results in the synthesis of abnormal chylomicron remnant

Other disorders in which abnormal structural lipoproteins and their concentrations are present in the blood are referred to as dyslipoproteinemia. One disorder of this kind is LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) deficiency. Low activity of this enzyme causes unesterified cholesterol to accumulate in plasma and tissues.

Further diseases include lipid storage diseases, or lipidoses, which are genetic diseases in which atypical amounts of lipids accumulate in cells and tissues. Lipidoses are characterized by the absence of enzymes needed to metabolize lipids or a defect in the proper functioning of enzymes. This abnormal fat deposition can lead to severe damage in cells and tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, kidney, and spleen. Two examples of lipidoses include Gaucher disease and Tay-Sachs disease. Gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and bone crises. Tay-Sachs is caused by the absence of the enzyme hexosaminidase-A and leads to a progressive loss of mental and physical capabilities.

While treatment for lipidoses is unspecific and mainly limited to enzyme replacement therapy, there are medication options that help lower lipid plasma levels. However, it is of the utmost importance to manage dietary consumption and lifestyle changes either before or in conjunction with starting medication. Some of these changes may include a reduced-calorie diet, exercise, and quitting smoking if one is a smoker. Popular medication options include statins, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, bile acid sequestrants, a cholesterol-absorption inhibitor, and nicotinic acid. Of these choices, statins are the most widely prescribed treatment.
