Oxalate is an organic acid produced by plants. It is primarily found in the leaves, fruits, nuts, and bark, typically in portions of the plant that can be shed. Its only function is the binding of circulating calcium originally absorbed by the plant through the root system. Therefore, a plant's oxalate load will depend not only on the type of plant but also on the calcium content of the groundwater in the field in which it is grown. This accounts for a large variation in oxalate levels even from the same plant variety.  Unfortunately, oxalate is typically found in portions of plants that humans often consume, particularly in green leafy vegetables like spinach. Animal food sources eaten by humans have virtually no oxalate content. Oxalate was first discovered in sheep who became sick and even died when eating in certain fields, which were later determined to have vegetation with very high oxalate levels, which the sheep were eating.

In humans, oxalate has no known beneficial or nutritional effect. It is absorbed primarily in the colon, passed through the liver, and is excreted in the proximal renal tubule. Some oxalate may be generated by glycolate metabolism in the liver or converted from excess vitamin C. In the urine, oxalate forms a strong bond with calcium forming crystals and eventually stones depending on the concentration and the presence or absence of various promotors and inhibitors of stone formation such as citrate. Urinary oxalate is the single, strongest promotor of kidney stones known. It is typically 15 to 20 times stronger than urinary calcium in promoting the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones. The solubility of oxalate at body temperature at a pH of 7 is only about 5 mg/L, so urine is usually supersaturated with oxalate in most people. It does not form stones in everyone due to the activity of urinary stone inhibitors like citrate. Oxalate forms a soluble complex with sodium and potassium; it is only when combined with calcium that it forms insoluble crystals of calcium oxalate. Calcium oxalate tends to form at relatively low urinary pH (<7.2), while calcium phosphate will form when the urine is more alkaline (>7.2).

From the point of view of crystallization science, stone formation results from a combination of abnormal factors that influence the chemistry, supersaturation, and rate-controlling processes involved in the formation of crystals of the various kidney stone-forming minerals. The principal thermodynamic driving force is the degree of supersaturation of the fluid in which this process occurs. The laws of crystallization hold for both intracellular and extracellular crystal formation. The following steps lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones:

- Nucleation**:**This is the first step leading to crystallization and can occur either homogeneously or heterogeneously. Homogeneous crystal nucleation requires a greater degree of calcium oxalate supersaturation compared to heterogeneous nucleation. By contrast, heterogeneous nucleation requires lesser amounts of precipitating salts due to the presence of proteins and other organic polymers that provide chemically active surfaces that facilitate the nucleation process. Heterogeneous nucleation is the more common mechanism of human calcium oxalate crystal formation in humans.

- Supersaturation: A relative supersaturation level is a measurement of the potential for a crystal to form in the urine. It varies with each solute and balances the chemical crystal promotors and inhibitors. The level at which nucleation occurs is referred to as the formation product of the mineral concerned. This provides a range of supersaturation values where facilitating de novo crystal nucleation is possible.

- Crystal growth and agglomeration: Once a crystal is established, the surrounding urine facilitates the growth of this crystal. These growing crystals stagnate at sites where the urinary flow is relatively sluggish, either due to narrowing of the tubule as in the proximal tubule, when it meets the loop of Henle, at the papillary base where renal tubules bend, or at the slit-like openings of the collecting duct that structurally favor plugging. When these come in contact with the surrounding epithelial cells, they grow into macromolecules. These travel along the length of the tubules whilst continuously accumulating crystals on the way.

- Rate of crystal growth: This is determined by the relative supersaturation level as well as accompanying components that promote crystallization like magnesium, citrate, pyrophosphate, matrix substance A, various uncharacterized urinary proteins, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans and the polymerized form of Tamm–Horsfall protein, amongst others.
