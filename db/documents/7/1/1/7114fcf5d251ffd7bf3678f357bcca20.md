Macroglossia is usually seen in association with genetic syndromes. Macroglossia can be congenital or acquired. Congenital macroglossia is an uncommon condition usually diagnosed at birth but can present in the first few years of life. Differential diagnosis of macroglossia is broad, and a thorough evaluation of history, physical exam, laboratory, and imaging tests are needed to find the etiology. Most cases can be managed conservatively, and about 10% of cases need surgical correction for complications. An interprofessional approach is needed in treating patients with macroglossia with medications, surgery, radiotherapy, or psychotherapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the conditions associated with macroglossia.
- Outline how to differentiate between true and relative macroglossia and specific conditions that cause them.
- Review the differential diagnosis of macroglossia.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by macroglossia.
