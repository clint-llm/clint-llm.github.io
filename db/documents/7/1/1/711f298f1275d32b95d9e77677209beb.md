Host defense proteins like opsonin (CRP), haptoglobin, lactoferrin, serum amyloid A and procalcitonin provide additional protection. Septic neonates have decreased the production of Interleukins (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IEN-gamma, and IL-12). The quantitative and qualitative deficits in neutrophils, neutrophil depletion of bone marrow, and decreased deformability and delayed apoptosis play a significant role in neonatal sepsis-causing endothelial damage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multi-organ failure.
