Ocular hypotony is a potentially vision-threatening condition.

Ocular hypotony can be clinical or non-clinical, depending on the occurrence of clinical features. It is not clear who will develop clinical signs of hypotony, and some patients can tolerate long periods of hypotony without loss of vision. Yet others develop features of keratopathy, maculopathy, and even choroidal effusion. Management depends on the identification and treatment of the cause. With timely diagnosis and prompt management, an excellent final visual outcome isÂ possible in most cases with ocular hypotony.
