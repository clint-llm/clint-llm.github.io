At the beginning of pregnancy, amniotic fluid is largely a byproduct of maternal serum and resembles plasma due to hydrostatic and osmotic pressures. After 8 weeks of gestation, the fetal kidneys begin to function and produce urine; however, this does not become a key component of amniotic fluid until closer to 23-25 weeks when fetal keratinization is complete.

Additional recycling pathways include the intramembranous pathway of the placenta, umbilical cord, and fetal skin between the amniotic fluid and fetal blood (400 mL per day).

Under normal conditions, maternal serum remains near but slightly lower in osmolality to fetal serum favoring flow to the fetus. Following fetal keratinization, amniotic fluid remains 10 Osm lower than fetal blood, allowing continuous flow through the placenta to the fetal blood.
