The cell is the fundamental organizational unit of life. All living things are composed of cells, which then further subdivide based on the presence or absence of the nucleus, into two types: eukaryotic cells
(Greek, Eu=true, karyo=nut, nucleus) - these cells are present in all the human, animal and plants with a clear, distinct nucleus. Prokaryotic cells are some bacteria and blue-green algae which do not contain a clear and distinct nucleus, but the nuclear material is spread within the cytoplasm. The cells with a similar structure and function come together to form tissue. The tissues basically classify as four different types, namely, the epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous tissues. A combination of these tissues is present in an organ. The total number of cells, their type, size, and shape finally determines the size, structure, and function of each particular organism.

A human body is composed of close to fifty to a hundred trillion cells.

Understanding the details of each type of cell is a study on its own. Hence, in the present article, only some of the basic and essential features of a normal cell will be described.
