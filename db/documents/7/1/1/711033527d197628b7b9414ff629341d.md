Physiological problems at the level of the esophagus are most likely perceived as dysphagia or difficulty swallowing. Esophageal motility disorders, as well as obstructive esophageal lesions, impair the physiology of the esophagus and lead to a perceived sensation of dysphagia. Motility disorders arise from problems in the esophageal muscles or in the nerves that supply them. In contrast, obstructive lesions cause mechanical narrowing of the esophageal lumen. Both lead to an altered passage of food through the esophagus and resultant dysphagia. Oropharyngeal dysphagia arises from problems in the oropharynx and results in difficulty initiating a swallow. Esophageal dysphagia is a problem at the levels of the esophagus and causes difficulty swallowing sensed as food stuck in the chest.
