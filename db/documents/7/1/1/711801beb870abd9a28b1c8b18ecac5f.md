Oxygen boosts vitality to support increased demand during healing. Oxygen is required for multiple intracellular processes, including synthesis and transport.

Oxygen levels also directly affect the rate and quality of collagen formation. Oxygen is required by multiple enzymes for the proper formation of fibers and cross-linking of collagen fibers to form organized structures, resulting in better strength with reduced recidivism and improved appearance with reduced scarring. Increasing oxygen levels results in faster cell proliferation, reepithelialization, and collagen formation, all of which accelerate wound healing.
