A diagnosis of fistula-in-ano should be considered for any patient with purulent or feculent anal drainage, especially with a history of an anorectal abscess, Crohnâ€™s disease, or prior radiation. Diagnosis is often confirmed on physical exam, but more complex fistulas may require imaging for identification. Classification of the fistula is based on anatomy, which is best assessed during the exam. Due to high levels of pain with the exam, an exam under anesthesia may be necessary for an accurate diagnosis.

The treatment options for fistula-in-ano vary widely depending on external sphincter involvement. The development of new and novel treatments aimed at sphincter conservation continues. Although medical treatment is appropriate for some cases, most fistulas require a surgical procedure. Diagnosis or suspicion of an anal fistula should be followed by surgical consult. In the setting of a complex fistula, colorectal surgical consult may be necessary.
