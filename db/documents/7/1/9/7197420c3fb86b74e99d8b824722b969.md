Patients should be advised to attend their regular eye appointments to ensure their disease remains optimally controlled on the available treatments. Any sudden changes to vision, including metamorphopsia, scotoma, flashes, floaters, or blurry vision, should prompt an urgent assessment by an eye care professional. Patients should be advised to check each eye with an Amsler grid regularly.
