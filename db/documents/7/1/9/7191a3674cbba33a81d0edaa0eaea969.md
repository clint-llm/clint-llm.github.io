While providers work in highly stressful environments and situations, it is not a usual part of the medical education curriculum how to manage the ongoing nature of that stress. This lack of instruction could be a basis for the high rate of burnout as it seems to be an individual's response to this chronic stress that determines whether an individual will suffer burnout syndrome or not. Pathological responses to stress including drug or alcohol addiction, isolation, or repression can lead to further burnout-related symptoms and increase the risk for depression and suicide among providers. It should be noted that suicide is not typically thought to be a result of burnout alone, and it is more commonly seen in those with other mental illnesses such as depression.
