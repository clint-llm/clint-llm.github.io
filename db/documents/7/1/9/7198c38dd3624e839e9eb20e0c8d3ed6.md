It is not uncommon that the diagnosis of mammary Paget disease is initially overlooked and missed. Longer the delay, the longer the chance for the underlying neoplasm to spread, potentially leading to lymph node metastasis, if not occurred already, worsening the stage of the disease. The more widespread disease will need more extensive tissue dissection. The complications of breast cancer treatment in the patients of mammary Paget's disease are the same as for the treatment of any breast cancer surgery. The excision of lymph nodes may lead to lymphedema in the long run. The use of chemotherapy and radiation therapy might increase the risk for other cancers as well. Hormonal therapy and radiation therapy might also increase the risk of early menopause or infertility.
