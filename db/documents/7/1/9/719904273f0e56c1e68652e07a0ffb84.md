The exact etiology of Tietze syndrome is unclear. Some studies have postulated that multiple microtraumas to the anterior chest wallÂ may trigger the development of Tietze syndrome. It may occur more frequently in certain conditions, such as psoriatic arthritis. Sometimes the development of the disorder may be preceded by chronic, excessive coughing, vomiting, trauma or impact to the chest, viral or bacterial infections, or surgery to the thoracic area.
