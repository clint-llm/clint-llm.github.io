Following trauma to the larynx, swelling usually occurs within 6 hours post-trauma. Swelling canÂ compromise the airway.

Anterior direct trauma appears to cause the most severe injury to larynx. In the younger age group, the elastic nature of cartilage may result in damage to the soft tissue rather than cartilage itself. The isolated fracture of the thyroid cartilage is the most frequent injury encountered, while fracture of the cricoid alone is very unusual. Almost 85% of the cricoid cartilage trauma cases are associated with tracheal cartilage involvement.

Bloom, Carvalho, and Kearns explained the difference between the mechanism of laryngeal trauma in adults and children. Laryngeal trauma is exceedingly rare in children due to anatomical and behavioral variation.

- Supraglottic laryngeal fracture causing posterior displacement of the epiglottis and laryngeal inlet

- Cricotracheal separation: usually fatal

- Vertical midline fracture which will damage the anterior commissure and separate the thyroid alae

- Comminuted fracture: usually common in older, calcified, and rigid larynx
