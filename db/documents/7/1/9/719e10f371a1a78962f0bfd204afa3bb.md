**Clinical Presentation**

**Viral Hepatitis**

Clinical presentation of viral hepatitis can be different in every individual depending on the type of virus causing the infection. Patients can be entirely asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic at presentation. A small number of patients can present with rapid onset of fulminant hepatic failure.

Typically patients with viral hepatitis go through 4 phases.

**Phase 1 (viral replication phase)**- Patients are usually asymptomatic in this phase, and laboratory studies are positive for markers of hepatitis.

**Phase 2 (prodromal phase)**- Patients in this phase usually present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, malaise, pruritus, urticaria, arthralgias, and fatigue. Many times these patients are misdiagnosed as having gastroenteritis or viral infection.

**Phase 3 (icteric phase)**- Patients in this phase present with dark-colored urine and pale-colored stool. Some patients develop jaundice and right upper quadrant pain with liver enlargement.

**Phase 4 (convalescent phase)**- Patients typically start noticing the resolution of symptoms, and laboratory studies show liver enzymes returning to normal levels.

**Hepatitis A**

Patients who are infected with hepatitis A virus usually present with symptoms similar to gastroenteritis or viral respiratory infection, including symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever, jaundice, anorexia, and dark urine. Symptoms usually start after the incubation period is over, and they resolve spontaneously in a majority of patients

**Hepatitis B**

Patients with hepatitis B virus infection enter the prodromal phase after the incubation period and have symptoms of anorexia, malaise, and fatigue which are the most common initial clinical symptoms.  Some patients may experience right upper quadrant pain due to hepatic inflammation.  A small percentage of patients experience fever, arthralgias, or rash.  Once these patients progress to the icteric phase, they develop jaundice and painful hepatomegaly.  dark-colored urine and pale-colored stools. After the icteric phase, clinical course can be variable where some patients experience rapid improvement in the symptoms, and others can develop a prolonged illness with a slow resolution with periodic flareups.  A small number of patients can have rapid progression of the disease that can lead to fulminant hepatic failure over a few days to weeks

**Hepatitis C**

Patients infected with the hepatitis C virus develop similar symptoms after the incubation period to those of hepatitis B virus infection during the acute infection phase with symptoms of anorexia, malaise, and fatigue.  However, 80% of patients remain asymptomatic and do not develop jaundice

**Hepatitis D**

The majority of patients who have a simultaneous infection with the hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus have a self-limited infection.  Symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis B infection. Chronic hepatitis B virus carriers who develop superinfection with hepatitis D virus tend to have more severe acute hepatitis, and the majority of these patients end up developing chronic hepatitis D virus infection. Chronic infection with both hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus can lead to fulminant liver failure, severe chronic active hepatitis, and progression to cirrhosis in a majority of patients compared to those patients who only have chronic hepatitis B virus infection

**Hepatitis E**

Patients with acute hepatitis E virus infection develop an acute self-limited illness similar to hepatitis A virus infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is rare, but patients with hepatitis E infection who are pregnant have a higher mortality rate.

**Hepatitis G**

Patients with hepatitis G infection can have a mild infection without jaundice, but most patients are asymptomatic. There have been few reports of fulminant and chronic hepatitis as well as hepatic fibrosis also, but it is not common. The patient can have an elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase as well, but most patients infected with the hepatitis G virus have normal liver function tests

**Autoimmune Hepatitis**

Autoimmune hepatitis can clinically present in various ways. Patients can be completely asymptomatic, with the only abnormality being the elevation of liver enzymes on the laboratory studies compared to those presenting with fulminant hepatitis. Symptoms depend on the stage of the liver disease at the time of presentation.  The most common symptoms include fatigue, malaise, jaundice, abdominal pain, and arthralgias.  In the late stages, patients can have ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleed.  Patients can also have other autoimmune diseases along with autoimmune hepatitis and can experience symptoms from those diseases as well

**Alcoholic Hepatitis**

Patients with alcoholic hepatitis usually are malnourished and have physical signs of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Fever and tachycardia, along with right upper quadrant pain, have been reported as well.  Hepatic bruit due to an increase in the blood flow is characteristic of alcoholic hepatitis but is not a common finding. Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, malaise, and anorexia. More severe cases can have hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, ascites, and variceal bleed due to portal hypertension, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia.

**Physical Examination**

Physical findings vary in individual patients depending on the time of presentation. Many times patients present with a low-grade fever. Patients can show signs of dehydration, especially if they have been having vomiting and loss of appetite. Findings like a dry mucous membrane, tachycardia, delayed capillary refill, etc. can be observed. During the icteric phase, patients can have jaundiced skin or sclerae and sometimes can have urticarial rashes. Tender hepatomegaly may be observed. In advanced liver failure, signs of ascites, pedal edema, malnourishment may be observed. In alcoholic hepatitis, patients may have splenomegaly along with hepatomegaly.
