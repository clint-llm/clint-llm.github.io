A careful physical examination, including visualization of the abdominal wall itself in select patients, may show a Grey Turner's sign suggesting potentially serious intra-abdominal pathology, in particular, intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding. This sign may be especially important in the setting of patients who cannot provide an otherwise adequate history or demonstrate abdominal tenderness on examination due to altered mental status or intubation with mechanical ventilation. Additionally, Grey Turner's sign may guide a clinician to consider retroperitoneal hemorrhage in unstable patients. This guidance is particularly important in an unstable patient with a bedside ultrasound that reveals no intra-abdominal bleeding, given that ultrasonography cannot reliably detect retroperitoneal bleeding.

Researchers have not adequately determined the sensitivity and specificity of Grey Turner's sign for detecting intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal pathology, although sensitivity is almost certainly low. Studies have shown it is an uncommon finding among patients with pancreatitis, present in about 1%.

In addition to the physical exam finding of flank ecchymosis, CT scanning may reveal a radiographic Grey Turner's sign. In a review of patients with severe acute pancreatitis who underwent CT imaging, researchers found that radiographic evidence of extension of retroperitoneal fluid collections laterally beyond the aponeurotic layer to the abdominal wall predicted organ failure and death with an overall mortality rate near 40%.

Other commonly cited subcutaneous manifestations of intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage include Cullen's sign (periumbilical ecchymosis), Fox's sign (ecchymosis of the upper thigh with a sharply defined superior border paralleling and inferior to the inguinal ligament), and Bryant's sign (blue discoloration of the scrotum).
