An essential function of the kidneys is the excretion and filtration of nitrogenous toxins from the body. To accomplish this, the kidneys typically receive twenty-five percent of the cardiac output. In acute kidney injury, there is a rapid decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which leads to the build-up of nitrogenous wastes such as creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. However, it is important to remember that these markers serve as an imperfect proxy of GFR.

Prerenal renal failure occurs due to poor perfusion of nephrons, which in turn leads to a decrease in the GFR. Fundamentally, it is related to an imbalance in the delivery of nutrition and oxygen to the nephrons during periods of increased energy demand. Therefore, any process that affects the systemic circulation or decreases renal perfusion can compromise the GFR. In a healthy individual, autoregulatory functions are in place, which helps to uphold the GFR. However, in patients with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), these autoregulatory mechanisms may be inadequate to bolster the GFR. A few of the causes of prerenal AKI include but are not limited to; intravascular volume depletion,  hypotension, sepsis, shock, over diuresis, heart failure, cirrhosis, bilateral renal artery stenosis/solitary functioning kidney which is worsened by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and also by other drugs (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), calcineurin inhibitors, diuretics, etc.).

Intrinsic causes of AKI can be further subdivided into vascular, interstitial, glomerular, and tubular. Of these causes, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common. A nephrotoxic insult or prolonged ischemia usually causes ATN. Unlike prerenal etiologies of AKI, ATN is not improved by volume repletion. Both causes of ATN eventually do improve over time, but depending on the degree of the impairment, renal replacement therapy can be warranted. Glomerular causes of intrinsic AKI are related to underlying systemic illnesses or rheumatological diseases (i.e., lupus, Wegner, and Goodpasture syndrome). This occurs secondary to inflammation of the renal vasculature, and glomeruli, and can be best identified by renal biopsy. The treatment usually consists of immunomodulators or cytotoxic agents. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), is typically associated with medication use, but can also be related to other conditions. Although not pathognomic, eosinophiluria is generally seen in AIN. Post-renal AKI is usually provoked by obstructive causes, such as diseases that obstruct urinary flow (enlarged prostate). Post-renal AKI usually improves once the obstruction is relieved.
