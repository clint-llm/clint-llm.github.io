Booster doses with a measles-containing vaccine after appropriate vaccination is not necessary.

**Contraindications**

- Severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis after a previous dose of MMR / MMRV or after one of the components of the vaccine (e.g., neomycin, gelatin)

- Pregnancy or planning for it - the pregnancy should be discouraged within 28 days of vaccination due to the risk of congenital rubella. However, performing a pre-vaccination pregnancy test is unnecessary if the patient denies pregnancy.

- Immunodeficiency

- Hematopoietic proliferative diseases

- Solid tumors/chemotherapy

- Congenital immunity disorders

- Long-term immunosuppressive treatment, when administering high doses of steroids, i.e., at least 2 mg/kg per day or at least 20 mg/day prednisone equivalents for persons over 10 kg for more than 14 consecutive days, MMR vaccination should be postponed a month. However, lower doses of systemic corticosteroids, supporting physiological doses (the so-called replacement therapy), and local corticosteroid injections (e.g., into joints or tendons) are not contraindications to MMR vaccination.

- HIV infection with severe immunosuppression, defined as the percentage of CD4 + lymphocytes [CD4] below 15 percent at any age or if the percentage of CD4 is not available: CD4 less than 750 /mL for children = 12 months; CD4 below 500 /mL for children 1 to 5 years of age; CD4 less than 200 /mL for children aged over five years.

- Family history for congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency in parents or siblings, except for persons whose immunological system has been confirmed by laboratory tests.

**Relative Contraindications**

- Treatment in the last 11 months with blood products or immunoglobulins - may contain antibodies or inhibit the host response to a live vaccine. Therefore, the recommendation is that the interval from administering such treatment to MMR vaccination is from 3 to 11 months, depending on the type of transfused preparation.

- Anamnesis with thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenia - may show an increased risk of clinically significant thrombocytopenia after immunization with MMR or MMRV. Therefore, decisions on the first dose of MMR for children with a thrombocytopenia history must consider the risks and benefits. In general, the benefits outweigh the risks. Factors to be considered when making this decision include:1) relapse of thrombocytopenia after MMR in patients with a history of thrombocytopenia (both related to the vaccine and not related to the vaccine).2) the probability of the child's exposure to measles, mumps, and rubella (e.g., planned trips abroad, the epidemiological situation in the place of residence/stay of the child)

- Before the second dose of MMR vaccination is given, Clinicians can perform serological tests to determine if it is necessary. Children with a protective level of measles, mumps, and rubella antibodies do not need to receive a second dose. However, for children with a history of thrombocytopenia who do not have a protective level of measles, mumps, or rubella antibodies, decisions on administering a second dose of MMR are taken individually to reassess the risks and benefits.

- Acute moderate or severe disease, with or without fever, to avoid the imposition of any vaccine reaction on the symptoms of infection and the vaccine burden with symptoms due to infection. Vaccinate children with mild infections (e.g., upper respiratory tract infection, ear infection, diarrhea). Postponing vaccination in such a situation unnecessarily delays the implementation of the immunization program and lengthens the susceptibility to infection.

**Contraindications Do Not Constitute**

- A positive tuberculin test in people with active TB infection should receive treatment with anti-tuberculosis before vaccination. A simultaneous tuberculin test should be performed either on the day of MMR vaccination or 4 to 6 weeks after it because the measles virus contained in the vaccine may weaken the skin reaction to tuberculin.

- Breastfeeding period

- Pregnancy of the mother of a child who is to receive a vaccine or pregnancy in a person in the immediate vicinity of the child

- Reproductive period

- A person who is immunocompromised in the family or immediate environment

- Asymptomatic HIV infection or HIV infection with mild symptoms, without immune disorders

- Allergy to egg protein - in children with a history of mild allergy to a hen egg, the risk of anaphylactic reaction after MMR vaccination is the same as in the general population.

- In children with severe allergies - anaphylaxis or an immediate reaction after ingestion, the eggs are automatically included in the group of higher risk of sudden allergic reactions, also after vaccines. In the case of MMR, gelatin and neomycin are more allergenic to egg protein.
