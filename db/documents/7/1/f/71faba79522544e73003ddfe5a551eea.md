Most often, the undivided sciatic nerve exits the greater sciatic foramen inferior to the piriformis, but this is not always the case.

- Type I: sciatic nerve exits inferior to piriformis, undivided. This is the most common form.

- Type II: sciatic nerve divides above piriformis; one portion exits through the piriformis, the other inferior to it. The common fibular (peroneal) division passes through the piriformis. This is especially problematic when the common fibular nerve passes between the two tendons of the piriformis.

- Type III: sciatic nerve divides above piriformis; one portion courses anterior to piriformis, the other posterior to it

- Type IV: sciatic nerve exits through the piriformis, undivided

- Type V: sciatic nerve divides above piriformis; one portion exits through the piriformis, the other superior to it

- Type VI: sciatic nerve divides exist from the superior aspect of the piriformis posteriorly, undivided
