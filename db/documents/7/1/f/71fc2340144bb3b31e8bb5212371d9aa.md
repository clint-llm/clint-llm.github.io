The ethmoid bone is a small bone with a cuboidal structure that forms the lateral boundaries of the orbit, the anterior cranial fossa superiorly, and the nasal cavities inferiorly.

The ethmoid bone is situated in the paranasal sinuses and hosts the ethmoid air cells, which are responsible for olfactory sensation, humidification, phonation, and ventilation. It also influences drainage from the frontal and maxillary sinuses via the osteomeatal complex.
