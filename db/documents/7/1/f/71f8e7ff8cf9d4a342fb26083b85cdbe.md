A wound is defined as a discontinuity of the epithelial lining of the skin or mucosa due to physical or thermal damage and they can be present over different anatomical parts of the body. However, the basic principles of choosing a wound dressing remain the same. In the United States, chronic wounds affect more than six million people, and this will grow in numbers due to our elderly and diabetic populations. Choosing the correct dressing will lessen the time of healing, provide cost-effective care, and improve the patient’s quality of life.

The goal is to help the wound heal as soon as possible by using an appropriate dressing material to maintain the right amount of moisture. When the wound bed is dry, use a dressing to increase moisture and if too wet and the surrounding skin is macerated, use material that will absorb excess fluid and protect the surrounding healthy skin. Important criteria to consider before choosing a specific wound dressing are cleaning, absorbing, regulating, and the need to add medication. It is important to choose a dressing guided by the cost, ease of application, and clinician's preference.
