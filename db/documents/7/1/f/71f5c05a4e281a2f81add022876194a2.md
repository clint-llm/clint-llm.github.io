Although the proposed mechanism of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy involves cardiorespiratory failure secondary to a seizure, relatively little is known regarding specific histologic changes occurring in patients who died from SUDEP. Identifying specific histochemical markers and other post-mortem findings may help distinguish SUDEP from death from alternative causes. Physical examinations of patients withÂ SUDEP have revealed oral trauma (secondary to biting of the lip or tongue) and pulmonary edema.

Gross examination of the brain may reveal findings consistent with hypoxia, including mild gyral flattening consistent with brain edema; however, a significant mass effect has not been identified in SUDEP cases.
