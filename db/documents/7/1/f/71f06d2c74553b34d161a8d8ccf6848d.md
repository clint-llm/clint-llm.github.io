On histopathology, a distinct mucosal lining and smooth muscle coat are characteristic features of these cysts. The mucosal lining generally corresponds to some part of the gastrointestinal tract. The mucosal lining may be heterotopic and may not correlate with the adjacent bowel. Ectopic gastric mucosa is seen in approximately 20% to 30% of the cases and is common in esophageal and midgut duplication cysts. Pancreatic mucosa is commonly observed in gastric duplications. Besides this, bronchogenic cysts have respiratory epithelium, cartilages, and bronchial submucosal glands.
