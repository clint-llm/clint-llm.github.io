Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a thiazide-type diuretic that has been used clinically for more than half a century. The drug has been widely used to treat hypertension globally and is relatively very safe. Hydrochlorothiazide acts on the distal convoluted tubules and inhibits the sodium chloride co-transporter system. This action leads to a diuretic action that lowers blood pressure, but there is also a potassium loss in the urine. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, dosing, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of HCTZ and increases practitioners' knowledge regarding how to approach this medication and use and monitor it effectively to drive better patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the mechanism of action of HCTZ.
- Identify the indications for using HCTZ.
- Summarize the data on cardiovascular outcomes from HCTZ therapy.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving treatment with HCTZ.
