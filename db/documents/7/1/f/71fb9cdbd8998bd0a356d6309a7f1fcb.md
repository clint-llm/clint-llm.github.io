MDS may be suspected if one or more cytopenias are apparent. Per the International Working Group guidelines for MDS, there are 2 prerequisite criteria for diagnosis: (1) stable cytopenia for 6 months or longer, or 2 months if a certain karyotype or bilineage dysplasia is apparent, and (2) exclusion of other causes of dysplasia and/or cytopenia(s).SF3B1, TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, RUNX1, U2AF1, TP53, and EZH2.

On the peripheral blood smear, there are decreased numbers of one or more cell lines (red cells, platelets or neutrophils). Neutrophils may be hypogranular and have hyposegmented neutrophils (pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly), and platelets may be larger in size and lack granules. Myeloblasts, or blasts, are immature myeloid progenitors which are rarely seen in the peripheral blood and if seen, should also raise suspicion for acute myeloid leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy, which is required for diagnosis, is typically cellular or hypercellular, with dysplasia in one or more cell lines. A small number of patients may have hypoplastic bone marrow with MDS, but this is less common.

Diagnosis of MDS requires a histopathologic evaluation of the peripheral blood and bone marrow with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. The following criteria are required for diagnosis:

- One or more peripheral blood cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia) that cannot be explained by other causes, defined as hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL(100 g/L); absolute neutrophil count less than 1.8 x 10/L (less than 1800/microL); platelets less than 100 x 10/L (less than 100,000/microL).

- Blasts, which account for less than 20% of nucleated cells in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood. If there is more than 20% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow, myeloid sarcoma or presence of certain genetic findings including t(8;21), inv(16), or t(15;17), this is considered to be acute myeloid leukemia regardless of blast percentage.

- Evidence for dysplasia in greater than 10% of cell lines (red cell precursors, granulocytes or megakaryocytes.)

A pathologist will examine both the peripheral blood and marrow smears using Giemsa and iron staining. When evaluating the bone marrow, greater than 10% dysplasia of granulocytic cells is required as part of the diagnosis for MDS. Additionally, quantifying the number of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow is also important. Myeloblasts, or blasts of myeloid lineage, can be described as cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio (N:C ratio), fine nuclear chromatin, visible nucleoli, with or without granules. Auer rods are pink rod-like structures in the cytoplasm which are pathognomonic for myeloblasts. Myeloblasts should only account for less than 20% of nucleated cells in the bone marrow. If the percentage is above 20%, this would be considered acute myeloid leukemia. Iron staining with Prussian blue reaction is performed to evaluate for ring sideroblasts, which are described as a ring of iron-laden mitochondria around the nucleus of erythroid progenitors.

Cytogenetic analysis by FISH is also typically done to identify chromosomal abnormalities as this can influence both prognosis and treatment. It also helps determine clonality. While a normal karyotype does not rule out MDS, around half of patients will have some type of cytogenetic abnormality. MDS is typically associated with aneuploidy, while translocations are less common. The most frequently observed alterations include del(5q), monosomy 7 or del(7q), trisomy 8, and del(20q). Deletion of the long arm of 5, or del(5q), is associated with a better prognosis compared to others and responsiveness to lenalidomide, one of the treatments for MDS. The WHO MDS classifications lists MDS with isolated 5q as one of the categories. This category is defined as isolated del(5q) and can include one other cytogenetic abnormality except for monosomy 7 or del(7q).

Somatic mutations have recently proven to be vital in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of MDS. They also have been shown to correlate with survival in some cases. There have been hundreds of mutations implicated in MDS, and a mutation can be found in 80% to 90% of patients. There is overlap of mutations shared with AML. The most common mutations include TET2, SF3B1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, SRSF2, RUNX1, TP53, U2AF1, EZH2, ZRSR2, STAG2, CBL, NRAS, JAK2, SETBP1, IDH1, IDH2, and ETV6. These mutations are also associated with various clinical features. TP53 for example, carries a poor prognosis and is associated with higher blast percentage in the bone marrow and worse thrombocytopenia. It is also associated with complex cytogenetics.
