Approximately 500000 cholecystectomies were performed each year in the late 1990s in the United States; mostly laparoscopic. About 50000 or more cases of PCS occurred each year with at least 10% of patients developing PCS. The frequency of PCS varies widely in the literature with 5 to 30% of patients reported to have post-cholecystectomy syndrome. International incidence of post-cholecystectomy syndrome is almost identical to the United States. One study found that 65% of patients had no symptoms, 28% presented with mild symptoms, while only 2% had severe symptoms.

- Urgent surgery presents a higher risk of developing PCS

- If cholelithiasis is present, 10-25% of patients develop PCS - if absent, approximately 30% develop PCS

- There is an exponential increase in the risk of developing PCS with increasing duration of preoperative symptoms

- About 20% of patients will develop PCS whether choledochotomy is performed or not

One study identified age and sex differences in the incidence of PCS with patients aged 20 to 29 years with an incidence of 43% while those aged 30 to 69 years had an incidence of 21 to 31% and a female-to-male incidence ratio of 1.8:1.
