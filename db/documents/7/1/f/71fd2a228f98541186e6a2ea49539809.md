Careful evaluation and monitoring and effective resuscitation techniques are essential in improving the survival rate in affected neonates. Structural heart abnormalities and chromosomal disorders cannot be intervened with, and hence the prognosis is very poor. Therefore, they are excluded first before performing any interventions. Intrauterine interventions like thoracocentesis and peritoneal-amniotic shunt can be performed if the ultrasound detects mediastinal shift, polyhydramnios, fetal edema, or rapid accumulation of fluid, to confirm alveolar development and also helps in releasing the excessive amniotic fluid. In severe anemia and arrhythmias, intrauterine transfusion and antiarrhythmic drugs can be utilized, respectively. Intrauterine transfusions in patients with parvovirus-B19 infections can reverse hydrops, which may sometimes result in healthy live births. A few teratomas can be resected surgically in utero.

Postnatal management includes initial resuscitation, identification, and treatment of the underlying cause. Most of the infants with hydrops fetalis will require endotracheal intubation because of respiratory depression. Thoracentesis, paracentesis, and sometimes cardiocentesis are performed if the neonate presents with pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusion. In cases of severe anemia, a blood transfusion is given.

Despite aggressive treatment, the survival rate is as low as 10 percent with neurodevelopmental and cognitive defects in surviving infants. The recurrence rate is highest in mothers whose infants have chromosomal abnormalities or Rh incompatibility. Hence, autopsies, including histopathologic evaluation, placental examination, molecular and genetic studies, are performed to determine the cause of hydrops.
