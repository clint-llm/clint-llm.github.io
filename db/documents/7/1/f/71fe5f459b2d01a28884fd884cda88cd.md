The management of patients with Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is best when using an interprofessional team that includes primary care doctors, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and pathologists. Stroke-trained nurses, physical therapists, and pharmacists should also assist in the case. The patient most often will present to the emergency department in the setting of stroke symptoms. Utilizing clinical and radiographic findings, the probability of CAA can be assessed. Treatment of ICH is similar to other spontaneous ICH, possibly requiring intervention from neurosurgery. Attention to blood pressure and intracranial pressure by the staff is essential. If there is residual impairment, rehabilitation is essential to regain mobility and function. The pharmacist may manage the pain and help with the appropriate use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. Long-term follow-up is essential to evaluate for reoccurrence and functional status. If CAA is thought to be familial CAA, further workup can be perused in an outpatient setting. Open communication between the interprofessional is essential for improving outcomes.
