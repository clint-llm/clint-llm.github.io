Arterial supply within the posterior neck triangle can be challenging to describe based on anatomic variations that exist from the origin of various arteries in this region. The textbook definitions of anatomic vasculature are provided below. Further descriptions of common variants of the vasculature appear in the Physiologic Variants section.

The subclavian arteries are located at the inferior border of the triangle posterior to the clavicle. The common carotid arteries are branches of the early portion of the subclavian arteries and course just outside of the triangle but may encroach into its anatomic space as they travel superiorly. Following the bifurcation of the common carotid artery into the external and internal carotid arteries at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra, the external carotid is visible in the posterior neck triangle. The thyrocervical trunk can be found coursing from the subclavian artery and readily gives off the transverse cervical artery and suprascapular artery, which both course laterally across the posterior neck triangle.

Prominent veins coursing through the posterior neck triangle include the terminal portion of the external jugular vein located on the inferior portion, as well as the subclavian vein. The suprascapular vein and transverse cervical vein join the external carotid vein in the inferior portion of the triangle. The internal jugular vein courses deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and is susceptible to injury during dissection of the posterior neck triangle.

Lymphatic supply within the posterior neck triangle includes the occipital, transverse cervical, and supraclavicular chains of lymph nodes. The clinical relevance of the supraclavicular lymph node, also known as Virchowâ€™s node, will be elaborated upon in the Clinical Significance section.
