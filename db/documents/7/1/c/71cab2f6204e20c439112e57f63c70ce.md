Usually, a clinical diagnosis is all that is required due to the self-limiting course of the infection.Â However, more severe cases such as myocarditis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal infection can sometimes require identification of the specific organism. Furthermore, laboratory diagnosis can be epidemiologically useful, especially during epidemics.

Enterovirus infection is diagnosed mainly through RT-PCR, viral cultures, or serological tests. RT-PCR is the most commonly used modality.

Other appropriate investigations include:

- CBC

- Comprehensive metabolic profile

- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate

- Chest X-ray

- Abdominal CT

- Head CT

- Lumbar puncture for CSF cell count, culture and sensitivity, Gram stain, protein, and glucose, viral PCR

- Lactic acid

- Procalcitonin
