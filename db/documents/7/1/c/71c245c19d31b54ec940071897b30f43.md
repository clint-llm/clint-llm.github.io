The prognosis for patients with incisional hernias is guarded. Despite the use of mesh and minimally invasive techniques, incisional hernias have high recurrence rates. Infection, pain, and recurrence are common problems. If the patient does not eliminate the risk factors the risk of recurrence remains high. Bowel obstruction, strangulation, and incarceration are also serious complications of the incisional hernias.
