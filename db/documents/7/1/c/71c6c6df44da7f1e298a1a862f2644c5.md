There are geographical variations in the distribution of reflux esophagitis. In Western countries, the prevalence of the disease is approximately 10% to 20%, and severe disease is observed in 6% of the population, while in Asian countries, the prevalence is approximately 5%.

Approximately half of the pregnant women complain of reflux during pregnancy: 20% to 30% in the first trimester, 40% to 45% in the second trimester, and 60% in the third trimester.

Reflux esophagitis and Barrett esophagus are associated with higher body mass index: The association with overweight has an odds ratio of 1.33, 95% confidence intervals of 1.07-1.64, and the association with obesity has an odds ratio of 1.70, 95% confidence intervals 1.36Â to 2.12.

Several medications have been associated with reflux esophagitis symptoms, including drugs acting by modulating the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, including nitrates, calcium channel blocker agents, anticholinergics, alpha-adrenergic agonists, theophylline, and morphine.

Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease exhibit an increased incidence of reflux esophagitis independent of any confounders.
