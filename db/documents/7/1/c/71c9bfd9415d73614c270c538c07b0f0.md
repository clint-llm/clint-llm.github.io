Dermoscopy may represent a non-invasive aid to the clinical diagnosis of Riehl melanosis. The most common observed findings are pseudonetworks, gray dots or granules, and telangiectatic vessels.

Reflectance confocal microscopy of biopsies correlates with the conventional histopathologic examination and may show pigment incontinence, mildly refractive cells corresponding to infiltrated lymphocytes, dilated vessels, and features of basal layer liquefaction including obscured papillary rims, total or partial obliteration of the ring-like structures around the dermal papillae.

Patch testing is recommended in diagnosing RM. Closed patch testing should be performed with standard series, cosmetic series, fragrance series, and patient’s products. If photoallergy is suspected, photo-patch testing should be carried out. Patch test sites may show papule, vesicle, or brown pigment. Given the low concentration of the allergen in cosmetic and fragrance series, repeated open application test (ROAT) are needed if closed patch testing is negative or equivocal. If ROAT performed on the flexor forearm skin is equivocal, the patient’s product could be applied to the face or other affected areas.

Skin biopsy is not required unless there is an atypical clinical presentation.
