Esophageal abrasions can cause a foreign body sensation that remains after the passage of a foreign object. If the patient is stable and tolerating oral intake, they can be reassessed within 12 to 24 hours, and if symptoms continue, then a CT scan or endoscopy may be needed.

Other conditions that might cause a foreign body sensation without a foreign body present include:

- Infection such asÂ Candida, Herpes simplex virus (HSV), or Cytomegalovirus (CMV)

- Esophagitis (acid reflux, pill esophagitis, eosinophilic esophagitis)

- Esophageal spasm

- Globus pharyngeus (also called globus hystericus) is a sensation of a lump or foreign body in the throat of uncertain etiology.

Again, if the patient is stable and tolerating oral intake then begin appropriate treatment for the underlying condition and/or arrange follow-up.
