Increased drug regulatory practices may reduce the incidence of limb deformities associated with misoprostol and thalidomide. Additionally, uncontrolled diabetes may have a teratogenic effect, and therefore appropriate prenatal care and diabetes management may also have an effect on decreasing the number of limb deformities. Even in the setting of these teratogenic causes, meromelia is extremely rare, and many cases are unavoidable. Therefore, if a child is found to have a limb truncation defect, a thorough evaluation is necessary to optimize patient survival and management. Parents should have their child evaluated by an appropriate primary clinician, geneticist, cardiologist, nephrologist, and/or gastroenterologist depending on relevant associated conditions. Furthermore, physical and occupational therapy can play a substantial role in maximizing patient function.
