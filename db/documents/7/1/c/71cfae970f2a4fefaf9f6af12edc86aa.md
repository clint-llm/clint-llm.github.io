The only mode of administration of albumin is by intravenous (IV) infusion. There are two formulations available that differ on the albumin concentration; albumin 5% and 25%. In general terms, albumin 25% is the therapeutic choice when either sodium or fluid is restricted or in cases of oncotic deficiencies. Albumin 5% use is more common in situations of volume loss as dehydration. However, concentration, the rate of infusion, and dosage depend on the patient's clinical situation, as stated above.
