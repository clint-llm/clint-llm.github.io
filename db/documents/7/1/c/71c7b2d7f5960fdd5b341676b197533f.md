Catheter-based treatment of the tricuspid valve is a recently new approach to treating tricuspid pathology. Endovascular repair of the valve avoids sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass. Tricuspid valve disorders have long been neglected based on beliefs that their rarity in prevalence does not readily determine patient prognosis. Untreated tricuspid valve disorders along with other cardiac diseases cause the patient higher morbidity and mortality.
