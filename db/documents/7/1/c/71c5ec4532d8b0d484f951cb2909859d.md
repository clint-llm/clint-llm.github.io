Local anesthetic system toxicity (LAST) primarily affects the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system. Local anesthetics can be assigned a cardiovascular collapse (CC) to CNS ratio, which is the ratio of the drug required to cause cardiovascular collapse compared to the drug dose required to produce seizures. Ropivacaine has a higher CC to CNS ratio (indicating a higher margin of safety) than bupivacaine and levobupivacaine. Ropivacaine has a greater arrhythmogenic cardiac effect and less of an effect on contractility.
