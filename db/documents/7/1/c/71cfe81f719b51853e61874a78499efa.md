The course of treatment for kyphosis will generally be starting conservatively and progressing to surgical intervention as a last resort if the patientâ€™s symptoms do not improve with conservative management or if the curvature is too significant.

Conservative management will consist of observation, physical therapy, and the use of NSAIDs. The indications for conservative management are for patients with kyphosis that is less than 60 degrees.

Bracing should be considered for adolescents who have kyphosis greater than 50 degrees.

The following are indications when surgery may be the appropriate course of action to take: pain not improving with a conservative approach, progressing curve, neurological deficits, cardiopulmonary compromise, and worsening trunk deformity (usually with kyphosis greater than 75 degrees). In age-related kyphosis where osteoporotic fractures of the vertebral bodies can happen and thus leading to kyphosis, two surgical approaches that can be considered are kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty (these approaches are mainly to treat refractory pain from vertebral compression fractures).

In congenital kyphosis, surgical treatment will need to be implemented due to the progressive nature of the disease. Conservative management will not prevent the likely catastrophic deformity and neurological compromise these patients can/will have.
