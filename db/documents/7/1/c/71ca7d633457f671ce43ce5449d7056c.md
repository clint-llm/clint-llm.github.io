Patients with PPSM are predominantly white (93%), female (90%) adults (mean age 62.2 +/- 13.2 years).

Notwithstanding these limitations, the prevalence of PPSM among those who have used PPS ranges between 0.7% to 2.4% and 3.4% in large-scale retrospective studies from insurance claims databases, however, these studies likely underestimate the true prevalence because patients would have to have been diagnosed with another retinal disease, and length of follow-up in the databases limits the ability to find an association between PPS and a retinal disorder.

Among larger prospective screening studies on known PPS users, the prevalence is estimated between 16.5% to 23.1%, although these may overestimate the true prevalence because of selection bias.
