The most common origin of the recurrent artery of Heubner was from the A2, followed by the ACA-ACoA junction (43.4%) in one study.

However, in other studies, the recurrent artery of Heubner most commonly originated from the junction of the A1 (origin of the ACA to the junction of the anterior communicating artery) and A2 (junction of the ACoA to the anterior border of the corpus callosum) segment of the ACA in 76.2% followed by A2 segment in 16.3% of cases.

It was either absent or duplicated in around 6% of the cases in the series.

It was triple in number in 0.14Â % of cases in one study.

The pattern of recurrent course of the recurrent artery of Heubner in its relation with A1 while moving towards the anterior perforated substance divide into

- Type I or the superior course (63%)

- Type II or anterior course (34%)

- Type III or posterior course (3%)

The intracerebral course of the recurrent artery of Heubner is uni-vectorial, thereby heading towards the head of the caudate nucleus. The recurrent artery of Heubner, during the extra- and intracerebral course, may join with the middle group of the lenticulostriate arteries or directly with the middle cerebral artery to form a rete.
