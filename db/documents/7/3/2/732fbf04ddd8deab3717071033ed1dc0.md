Many diagnostic tools for detecting epithelial downgrowth have been reported in the literature. Certain modalities may be more useful when specific risk factors or anatomical involvement are suspected. For example, Seidel testing may be useful in identifying fistulas, which are a commonly cited risk factor for epithelial downgrowth.

Specular microscopy, a noninvasive diagnostic test, reveals a pattern consisting of a sharply defined border between endothelium and epithelial downgrowth.

Confocal microscopy is another diagnostic tool. This non-invasive modality allows the observer to image living tissue at higher resolutions than specular microscopy and is less affected by corneal edema.

Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is another noninvasive imaging modality that has been shown to aid in the diagnosis of epithelial downgrowth after DSAEKÂ and penetrating keratoplasty.

Histopathologic analysis is the gold standard to confirm epithelial downgrowth. Diagnosis is based on the classic finding of one to three layers of stratified, non-keratinized squamous epithelium on the posterior cornea and anterior iris; however, any intraocular structure can be involved.
