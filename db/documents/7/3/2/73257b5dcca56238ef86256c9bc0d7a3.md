Elevation in tyrosine levels is the most common adverse effect of nitisinone drug use. It has been proposed that elevated levels of tyrosine, because of nitisinone therapy, is the most predicted cause of these adverse effects, especially the ocular manifestations.

Adverse reactions such as headaches or diarrhea may also occur with nitisinone use, especially in those receiving therapy by an oral suspension.

Patients must adhere to a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine to limit the eruptions of adverse reactions, and tyrosine levels are actively monitored while taking nitisinone.
