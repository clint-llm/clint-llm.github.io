Acute traumatic coagulopathy ensues immediately after massive trauma when shock, hypoperfusion, and vascular damage are present. The mechanisms for this include activation of protein C, endothelial glycocalyx disruption, depletion of fibrinogen, and platelet dysfunction. Factors such as hypothermia and acidaemia may amplify the endogenous coagulopathy and often accompany trauma. Hemodilution, hypothermia, and acidaemia are three major factors in subsequently leading to trauma-induced coagulopathy and, as such, are known as "classic trauma triad." All these factors culminate in decreased clot strength, autoheparinization, and hyperfibrinolysis. This increases the mortality and morbidity ratios significantly and must be treated vigilantly.
