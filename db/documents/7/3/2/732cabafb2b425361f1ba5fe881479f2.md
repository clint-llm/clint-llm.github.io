The gross appearance of MNG is an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple nodules exhibiting fibrosis, dystrophic calcification, and old and new hemorrhage. Microscopically hyperplastic nodules with a discrete fibrous capsule, composed of follicles with papillary hyperplasia and tall columnar cells, are present. The nonfunctioning nodules may appear inactive and have degenerative changes of calcification, fibrosis, and old and new hemorrhage.

In electron microscopic analysis, there is increased production of secretory granules in the epithelial cells of the thyroid follicles in the hyperactive nodules and varied development of general cytoplasmic organelles with the presence of fenestrated capillaries.
