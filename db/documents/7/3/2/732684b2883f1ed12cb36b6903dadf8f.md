Each year there are approximately 1500 patients in the United States who have hypothermia noted on their death certificates.Â  The true incidence of hypothermia and associated morbidity and mortality is unknown but even with supportive in-hospital care the mortality of those with moderate to severe hypothermia still approaches 40 percent.
