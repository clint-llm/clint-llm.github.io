Fecal impaction occurs because of hardened fecal matter retained in the large bowel which cannot be evacuated by regular peristalticÂ activity. If this is not recognized and treated early, it can give rise to the formation of fecoliths, or stone-like feces. Fecal impaction is a cause for increased morbidity and a significant cause of a decrease in quality of life among the elderly.
