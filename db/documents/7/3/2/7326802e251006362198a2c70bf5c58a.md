The prognosis of an IOFB depends upon multiple factors.

- Timing of presentation: Early presentation and management have a good visual outcome. Patients presenting late develop siderosis (in case of iron foreign body/bodies) and have a poor prognosis.

- Presenting visual acuity: If the presenting vision is good, then the final prognosis is generally good.

- The extent of injury: Small perforation of the sclera has a good prognosis.

- Location of the foreign body: Foreign body in the anterior segment has good visual outcome than the posterior segment IOFB.

- Type of injury: Globe rupture and perforating injuries have a bad prognosis.

- Associated features: The presence of an afferent pupillary defect, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, or endophthalmitis has a bad visual outcome.

The prognosis of an IOFB can also be predicted with the help of an Ocular trauma score (OTS). It was proposed by Kuhn et al. in early 2000 to predict the final vision of an injured eye.
