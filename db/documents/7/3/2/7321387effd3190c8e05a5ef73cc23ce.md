Central fenestrations in the triangular fibrocartilage disc proper may be present from the third decade of life and, unless bidirectional, are to be considered physiological. Bidirectional defects lead to communication between distal radioulnar and the radiocarpal compartment.

Ulnar variance affects TFCC thickness. Ulnar variance is the relative length of the distal articular surfaces of the radius and the ulna. It can be neutral (same length), positive (ulna longer over 2 mm), or negative (ulna shorter).
