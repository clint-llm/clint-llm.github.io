Although hyper- or hyposecretion of GIP is not causally related to the pathogenesis of diseases, the secretion of GIP is altered in the following disease states:

- Type 2 Diabetes Mellites

An abnormal incretin effect occurs in pathological glucose intolerance.

- Obesity

GIP plays a vital role in lipid metabolism and the development of obesity. Hyperplasia of K-cells and increased GIP levels are observed in obesity as fat is a potent stimulus of GIP secretion. As mentioned above, GIP is an anabolic hormone that inhibits lipolysis and stimulates lipogenesis.

- Food-Induced Cushing Syndrome

GIP, like ACTH, can cause hypersecretion of cortisol after mixed meals leading to food-induced Cushing syndrome or ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH).
