There is minimal data regarding the maximum tolerable dosage. Adverse effects that occur with filgrastim use mainly resolve following discontinuation of the drug. Some are manageable with supportive measures, e.g., bone pain, which is a common side effect usually managed with analgesics. Monitoring is essential to track response and minimize complications.

Although rare(<5%), Leukocytosis with WBC >100,000/mm^3 has been observed in BMT patients with minimal adverse effects. The recommendation is to discontinue the drug if it occurs to prevent potential complications.

There is no antidote for the reversal of filgrastim.
