Tracheal injury is an uncommon occurrence seen primarily after healthcare procedures, blunt and penetrating trauma, and caustic inhalations. Damage to the trachea carries with it a high potential for morbidity and mortality with improved prognosis linked to early recognition, and proper management and inversely related to the number of concomitant injuries. Options for treatment include variations on minimally invasive bronchoscopic procedures to open surgery. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of tracheal injury and reviews the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this injury.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomic structures that run close to the trachea.
- Describe the clinical findings and appropriate tests to identify a tracheal injury.
- Outline the critical considerations for managing a patientâ€™s airway with a tracheal injury.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by tracheal injuries.
