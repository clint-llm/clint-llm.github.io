In the management of BWS patients, it isÂ fundamental to include different specialists to provide the best possible care. In order to coordinate this, an experienced lead health-care provider should work closely with the patients and their families to ensure the continuous monitoring and follow-up needed in this specific population. Specific treatment indications, including supportive medical and surgical care, should be personalized for each specific case depending on the clinical presentation and molecular subtype if known. Periodic evaluations and proper transition to adult health-care services are also tasks that the primary care provider should arrange.
