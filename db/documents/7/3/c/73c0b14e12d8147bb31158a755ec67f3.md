Coronary heart disease impacts over 17 million adults in the United States. Of the 17 million Americans affected, 55% of those are male. It contributes to over 500,000 deaths each year in the U.S. At age 40 years, the lifetime risk of developing coronary disease is estimated at 49% for men and 32% for women. The incidence of coronary events increases with age, although the male predominance with these events gradually narrows with advancing age.

Coronary heart disease can also cause significant debility. This debility can manifest in several ways, one of which is angina. Angina affects over 10 million people in the U.S., with over 500,000 new cases diagnosed each year.
