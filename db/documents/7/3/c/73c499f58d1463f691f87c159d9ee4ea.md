**The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approved Indications for Verapamil are as Follows**

- Angina (chronic stable, vasospastic [prinzmetal variant], unstable angina [cresendo,preinfarction])

- Hypertension (as add on therapy)

- Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) prophylaxis

- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)

**The non-FDA-approved Indications for Verapamil are as Follows**

**Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**

Given as initial treatment in patients with: (1) Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome(NSTE-ACS, (2) continuing or frequently recurring ischemia and are unable to use beta-blockers (e.g., contraindication, suffered from unacceptable adverse effects, beta-blockers were insufficient for treatment) in the absence of:

- Clinically significant LV dysfunction,

- Increased risk for cardiogenic shock,

- PR interval greater than 24 seconds, or

- Second or third-degree AV block without a cardiac pacemaker

Furthermore, long-acting calcium channel blockers and nitrates are recommended in patients with coronary artery spasm (short-acting calcium channel antagonists should be avoided).

**Cluster Headaches**

Verapamil can be used as a first-line prophylactic at a minimum dosage of 240 mg per day per recommendation to reduce headache severity and decrease the frequency of episodes during a cluster period.

**Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**

Recommended for the treatment of symptoms (e.g., angina or dyspnea) in patients with obstructive or non-obstructive HCM who are unable to take beta-blockers (e.g., side effects/contraindications to beta-blockers, unresponsive to beta-blockers).

- Should be initiated at a low dose and titrated up to 480 mg/day,

- Its use requires caution in patients with high gradients, advanced heart failure, or sinus bradycardia.

**Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia (IVT)**

There are reports that the chronic use of oral verapamil for verapamil-sensitive idiopathy LVT can control IVT in many patients in both adults and children.
