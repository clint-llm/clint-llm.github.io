ORN results from a sequence of injury events beginning with radiation exposure and can be exacerbated by surgical manipulation of the affected tissue. The radiated mandible and surrounding tissues develop hyperemia, inflammation, and obliterative endarteritis. The small vessels are thrombosed, causing hypovascular-hypocellular-hypoxic tissue, which undergoes tissue breakdown. The rate of cell death and collagen lysis exceeds the homeostasis of cell replacement and collagen synthesis. The inability to repair leads to further inadequate vasculature and oxygen delivery. The overall result is a chronic, aseptic, non-healing wound. This gestalt mechanism has been proposed as a combination of earlier theories on the pathophysiology of ORN. Marx's theory proposes such acquired hypovascularity and hypoperfusion lead to the non-healing state and forms the rationale for hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. Delanian's fibroatrophic theory proposes fibroblast dysregulation and ultimately the breakdown of the healing response, leading to "fibrous atrophy," rendering tissues more prone to breakdown with minimal mechanical stressors. This forms the basis of treatments utilizing antifibrotic and antioxidant medications and is widely accepted today.
