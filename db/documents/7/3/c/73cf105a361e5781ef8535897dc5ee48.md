Routine laboratory testing is unnecessary following an accidental overdose in asymptomatic patients, provided that a history of acetaminophen overdose be excluded by history. When acetaminophen overdose cannot be excluded, a serum acetaminophen level should be obtained. Following large or self-injurious/suicidal overdose and in symptomatic patients, laboratory testing may include a complete blood count, blood gas analysis, and metabolic panel. Assessment for co-ingestants like ethanol, toxic alcohols, and aspirin may be appropriate depending on patent presentation. Serum ibuprofen concentrations are typically not readily available in the acute care setting but may be obtained from reference laboratories if confirmation of ibuprofen exposure is necessary.
