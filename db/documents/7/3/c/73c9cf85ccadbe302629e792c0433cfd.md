The vague presenting features of GLAD lesions, and their association with both unstable and stable shoulder injuries, means that a broad differential diagnosis should be considered. This should include any traumatic glenolabral pathology causing either anterior or global shoulder discomfort. Such lesions may consist of:

- Common traumatic labral tears, tearing of the labrum and associated ligaments partially or completely off the glenoid, most commonly the anterior-inferior labrum (Bankart lesions)

- Anterior-Inferior instability lesions that include a glenoid rim fracture - bony Bankart lesions

- Perthes lesion – a labral complex injury, but the labrum is still attached to the glenoid via a periosteal sleeve

- Anterior Ligamentous Periosteal Sleeve Avulsion – another labral injury, but it displaces medially on the glenoid neck

- (HAGL) or Bony HAGL – this time, the anterior-inferior glenohumeral ligament is avulsed from the humeral rather than labral attachment
