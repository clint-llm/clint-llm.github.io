TheÂ 24-hour urinalysis is a key component of the metabolic workup for recurrent stone formers. Accurate collections can detect treatable abnormalities predisposing to nephrolithiasis, and monitor treatment progress. Urinary constituents are highly variable based on diet and lifestyle factors. Interpretation is complex and often subjective due to this variability. Commercially available tests make analysis easily accessible. Metabolic evaluation utilizing 24-hour analysis is recommended for recurrent stone formers based on current guidelines.

Over 90% of kidney stone patients tested will demonstrate at least one chemical disorder that is sub-optimal. The fact that patients typically feel no better on treatment makes it far more challenging to keep patients on therapy long term. Therefore, those patients who are the most strongly motivated to minimize their kidney stone risk long-term and are likely to continue treatment long term will receive the most benefit from this testing. Twenty-four-hour urine testing is not curative, but it does direct effective prophylactic treatment for those who are willing to follow therapeutic guidelines on a long-term basis.
