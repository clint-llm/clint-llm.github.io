Laryngotracheal injuries have a high mortality rate although they are infrequently seen. These injuries may be penetrating or blunt and can occur in the supraglottic, glottic or infraglottic regions. The immediate goal for any patient presenting to the emergency department with a laryngeal injury should be to secure an airway. The activity discusses the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of laryngotracheal injury. Particular attention is paid to airway management for suspected or confirmed laryngotracheal injury.

**Objectives:**
- Understand the significance of laryngotracheal injury.
- Understand the physical findings associated with laryngotracheal injury.
- Understand airway management on laryngotracheal injury.
- Airway management in patients with laryngotracheal injury can be difficult. ED physicians, anesthesiologists, trauma surgeons and/or otolaryngologists as well as respiratory therapy may assist in airway management depending on local expertise and availability.
