If the patient is actively bleeding from the nose, hemodynamically stable, and has a patent airway, vasoconstrictive agents such as 4% cocaine, 1% to 4% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, or 0.05% oxymetazoline should be used to achieve hemostasis. After administering a vasoconstriction agent, the patient should be instructed to manually apply pressure for 15 to 20 minutes to the anterior nose, just behind the tip. Alternatively, a nasal clip can be used in the same location.

If bleeding persists despite these interventions, the patient should be placed in a “sniffing” position, sitting upright, flexing the neck, and extending the head. Both nares should be examined using a nasal speculum. If a large clot is present, it should be removed with suction to permit thorough visualization of the nasal cavity. If a discrete area of bleeding is visualized, cautery with silver nitrate may be attempted; this technique is usually unsuccessful if bleeding is significant. Electrocautery may be used for discrete, accessible bleeding if chemical cautery fails.

Nasal packing should be considered if these interventions fail to control epistaxis.
