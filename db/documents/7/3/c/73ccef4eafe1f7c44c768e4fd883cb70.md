The pathophysiology of lacunar syndromes is inherently linked to 2 vascular pathologies of the penetrating arteries from major intracranial and extracranial arteries: (1) thickening of the media resulting in decreased arterial diameter and (2) obstruction of the origins by microatheroma formation. Chronic hypertension, diabetes, and other genetic factors cause medial thickening by fibrinoid necrosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and other connective tissue elements. As a result, an occlusive disease in these penetrating arteries causes a small infarct in the territory that the small vessel supplies. Since collateral circulation in these distant pontine and subcortical areas is so limited, and multiple penetrating vessels are likely affected in these patients, areas of infarct coalesce to form lake-like areas of infarcted/edematous brain tissue. Healing of this tissue ultimately forms "lacunes."
