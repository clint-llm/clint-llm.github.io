Bariatric surgery for weight loss has become a common practice. The second most common bariatric procedure done today is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). To be a practicing health professional in the modern era, one must recognize the more common chronic complications that may result from altering the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how to manage these complications. To develop knowledge regarding the potential sequela of the operation, one must know the anatomy of the GI tract and the resulting physiologic effects of altering that anatomy. This activity reviews the common chronic complications following an RYGB concerning epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basics of the roux-en-y procedure.
- Explain the expected pathophysiologic results of the roux-en-y procedure.
- Outline the expected presentation of a patient with complications of the roux-en-y procedure.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance outcomes after a roux-en-y procedure.
