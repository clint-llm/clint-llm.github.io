It is still unknown how the antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) antibodies develop. Some studies suggest a genetic role. In two studies, there was an association between the anti-PR3-ANCA and HLA-DP, PRTN3 (the gene encoding proteinase-3), and anti-MPO ANCA was associated mainly with HLA-DQ polymorphisms.

Other studies showed that ANCA activates intracellular signaling pathways leading to altered adhesion molecule expression, which facilitates neutrophil adhesion and transmigration to the vascular endothelium.
