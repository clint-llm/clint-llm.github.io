The transfusion chain is made up of many team members, including clinicians, phlebotomists, blood bank personnel/ laboratories, and nurses, and they play an essential role in preventing and preventing transfusion-related infections. The importance of correctly obtaining, storing, and administering blood products and recipient monitoring post-transfusion cannot be understated as the integrity of the blood product supply chain depends on it. Proper training and regular education of this interdisciplinary team are vital in continuing to maintain and further improve the safety of blood transfusions.
