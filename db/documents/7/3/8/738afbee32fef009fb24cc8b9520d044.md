Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including nonfatal cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (HF), or new cardiac arrhythmias, are relatively common in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. For instance, the prevalence of postoperative MI is up to 1%, whereas there is a more significant number of patients who experienced increased levels of cardiac troponins without other signs of myocardial ischemia. Overall, these complications occur in approximately 5% of adult patients undergoing surgical procedures.****Indeed, guidelines on the topic suggest avoiding indiscriminate routine preoperative cardiac exams, as this approach result time- and cost-consuming, resource-limiting, and does not improve perioperative outcome.****

The inclusion of these indexes in dedicated algorithms (e.g., from guidelines) must be an essential step in a tailored path leading to an individualized cardiac risk assessment.****As a result, patients will benefit from all those interventions that may reduce MACEs rates in noncardiac surgical procedures.****This activity will discuss in detail the Goldman Risk Index and derivates, focusing on indications for use, patient safety, patient education, and clinical significance of the indices-guided assessment.
