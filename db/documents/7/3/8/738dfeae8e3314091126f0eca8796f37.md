While myelopathy is a term relating to the results of the compression of the spinal cord, stenosis is a term describing a narrowing of a normally patent canal. In the cervical spine, certain patients are more predisposed to myelopathy due to a congenitally narrowed spine cervical canal. Subsequent progression of stenosis or a cervical disc herniation will more likely result in myelopathy at this level. Degenerative changes are usually at C5 and C6 or C6 and C7 levels due to the increased motion permitted at these levels. Additional contributors to canal narrowing are the infolding of the ligamentum flavum, spondylolisthesis, osteophytes, and facet hypertrophy. Myelopathy will develop in approximately 100% of patients with greater than 60% canal stenosis (less than 6 mm disc cord space). Age is theÂ strongest predictor of perioperative morbidity and unfavorable neurologic recovery.
