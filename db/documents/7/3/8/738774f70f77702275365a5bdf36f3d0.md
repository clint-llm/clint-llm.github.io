Water hammer pulse is a physical exam finding that describes a bounding, forceful pulse with a rapid upstroke and descent. It is seen in many physiological and pathological conditions. Etiology can either be either be physiologic or pathologic. Water hammer pulse can be related to hyperdynamic circulatory states or cardiac lesions, but it is most commonly associated with aortic regurgitation. This activity describes the evaluation of patients with water hammer pulse and reviews the etiology-based management of these patients. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with pathologic causes of water hammer pulse.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the method for eliciting a water hammer pulse.
- Outline the pathophysiology of water hammer pulse.
- Review the most common causes of water hammer pulse.

- Outline the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team in the evaluation of patients with water hammer pulse.
