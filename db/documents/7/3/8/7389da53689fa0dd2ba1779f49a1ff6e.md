General anesthetics act on several receptors in the CNS, and their effects are generally reversible. In some patient populations, though, there is an increased risk of neurotoxic side effects, including memory and cognitive impairment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of anesthetic neurotoxicity and reviews the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of anesthetic neurotoxicity.
- Identify patient groups at increased risk of anesthetic neurotoxicity.
- Explain the clinical findings of anesthetic neurotoxicity.
- Review anesthetic drug classes associated with neurotoxicity and its management by an interprofessional team.
