Enteroatmospheric fistula (EAF): Every surgeon fears the development of an EAF due to the open abdomen. These fistulas are notoriously challenging to manage, as the enteric succus drains throughout the wound bed to make wound healing quite challenging. The fistula output may be thin with high biliopancreatic content if proximally located, or thick, brown, and highly contaminated with the gut microbiome if located distally. Each type of fistula output presents its challenges. The management of fistulas are discussed in detail elsewhere, but there are a couple of key points for the open abdomen.

A common misconception is that NPWT is associated with fistula formation when, in fact, EAF is lower in NPWT than other abdominal packing strategies.

As is true for all fistulas, nutrition is critical. Enteral nutrition is ideal if the fistula output remains low and manageable, but early support with parenteral nutrition may be necessary to avoid a catabolic state. Nutrition is even more critical in already malnourished patients.

Hernia: Early closure within 10Â to 14 days is the easiest way to prevent hernia. Few studies follow the long term development of hernias after an open abdomen, but the incidence has been reported as high as 21% at two years and >50% at five years.
