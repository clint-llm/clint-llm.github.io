Delivery by Cesarean section dates to 800 BCE. Unfortunately, at the time, the procedure was only done on a deceased or dying pregnant patient. It was not until the late 19th and 20th centuries when the first cases of perimortem cesarean section-use for salvage of the fetus were described. During the 1980s, additional case reports described its use to improve the survival of the mother. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications and complications of perimortem cesarean section and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of the pregnant patient.
