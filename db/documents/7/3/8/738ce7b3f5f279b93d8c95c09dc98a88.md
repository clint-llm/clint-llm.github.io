As mentioned before, PCWP is a reasonable surrogate marker of left atrial pressure and LVEDP. It is helpful to measure PCWP to diagnose the severity of left ventricular failure and quantify the degree of mitral valve stenosis. By measuring PCWP, the clinician can titrate the dose of diuretic drugs and other drugs used to reduce pulmonary venous and capillary pressure, thereby reducing pulmonary edema. Therefore, it can also guide therapeutic efficacy.

It is also used to evaluate and diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as patients with group 1 PAH will have PCWP ≤ 15 mmHg.

PCWP is also useful in differentiating cardiogenic shock (PCWP > 15 mmHg) from non-cardiogenic shock (PCWP ≤ 15 mm Hg). It is also used to evaluate blood volume status to guide fluid administration during hypotensive shock, where the PCWP goal should be maintained between 12 to 14 mmHg.
