Hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that may involve either the skin or viscera. Infantile hemangioma (IH) grows rapidly after birth then involutes slowly whereas, congenital hemangioma (CH) is fully formed at birth and involutes in early infancy. Patients with hepatic hemangiomas may be clinically silent only detected on ultrasonography as an incidental finding. This activity describes the evaluation and management of hepatic hemangiomas and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of infantile hepatic hemangiomas.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of infantile hepatic hemangioma.
- Identify the use of corticosteroids in the management of infantile hepatic hemangiomas.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with hepatic hemangiomas.
