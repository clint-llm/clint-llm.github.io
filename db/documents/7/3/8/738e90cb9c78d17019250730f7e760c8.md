There is no cure for varicose veins. Even after surgical removal, recurrences are common. Those who develop venous ulcers have the highest morbidity and a poor quality of life. Unlike the deep venous system, clots in superficial veins rarely embolize, and hence the risk of pulmonary embolism is rare. Untreated varicose veins reflect poor aesthetics, and this is the key reason why most people seek treatment.
