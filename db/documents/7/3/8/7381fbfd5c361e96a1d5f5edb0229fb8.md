The evaluation of a patient with suspected POW virus infection should focus on the presence or absence of neurologic symptoms. Those who present with non-specific flu-like symptoms are unlikely to benefit from disease-specific testing. However, in patients with geographic exposure presenting with encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, POW virus testing should be considered. Those with a high clinical suspicion for infection, brain imaging, serology, and lumbar puncture are key aspects of the diagnostic approach. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and normal glucose, though CSF findings can also be unremarkable. Other general laboratory findings may be seen in the peripheral blood, including thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated inflammatory markers.

A confirmatory diagnosis can be made by several methods, direct virus amplification (PCR), detection of IgM antibodies in serum by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), or detection of IgM antibodies in the CSF by EIA are all acceptable.

Given the overlapping geographic distribution of the POW virus with other arthropod diseases, it is also critical to assess patients for co-infection. Concurrent infections can lead to increased morbidity and mortality when not identified and are often treatable. Observational studies have shown that in those with confirmed POW virus encephalitis, a co-infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum or Borrelia burgdorferi can be found in 10% to 30% of patients.
