Pathophysiological processes related to peptides are very broad due to the ubiquitous nature of peptides in the body. This section will describe how peptides are involved in the pathophysiology of various metabolic processes.

**Peptide-Receptor Complex and Signaling Cascade**

Biologically active peptides are produced from genes that target specific proteins or protein-coupled receptors, such as G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs).

In some cases, when a peptide binding to a receptor causing a pathologic "on" state, unregulated transcription and proliferation may ensue, leading to an oncologic state. These cellular processes may be left unchecked and result in tumor growth. The design of synthetic peptides, created to act as endogenous peptides do and bind to a target receptor, can identify the location of tumor growth for identification and even for therapeutic purposes.

**Infection**

Peptides play a large endogenous role in humans and other species as a first-line barrier to fight infection. One of the components of the body's innate immune system includes the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the epithelium.

Dermcidin is a known gene that encodes antimicrobial resistance peptides in the sweat glands that can survive at a high salt concentration and over a wide range of pH values.
