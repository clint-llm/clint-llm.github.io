There exists no treatment to prevent the development of sickle cell retinopathy. Individuals suffering from thalassemia major and intermedia can develop two kinds of retinal abnormalities which are pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like retinal abnormalities and non-pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like retinal abnormalities Therapeutic intervention is suggested in cases of stage 3 (especially in the case of large sea fans),  stage 4 and stage 5 proliferative sickle retinopathy. Laser photocoagulation is the mainstay of treatment, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections are another option. Nonclearing vitreous hemorrhages require a vitrectomy, and retinal detachment requires vitrectomy or scleral buckling.

Thalassemia patients require regular ophthalmic screenings for early detection of retinopathy. Newer chelating agents like oral deferiprone have much lesser adverse effects compared to desferrioxamine, and careful monitoring can prevent most of them.
