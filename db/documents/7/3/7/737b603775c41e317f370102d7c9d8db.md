Hydatidiform moles are essentially very edematous immature placentas. They are broken down into complete and partial moles. A complete molar pregnancy happens when an empty ovum is fertilized by a sperm. This results in the development of only placental parts. A complete mole typically has a karyotype of 46,XX and is completely paternal in origin. A partial mole occurs when two sperm fertilizes a single ovum. This results in the development of some or all fetal parts. A partial mole normally has a triploid karyotype of 69,XXX, 69,XXY or 69,XYY; however, a diploid karyotype may also exist.
