Plasmacytomas share many biological features of other plasma cell disorders and can arise in any part of the body. SPB arises from plasma cells of the bone marrow, and EMP arises from the plasma cells of mucosal surfaces. According to some authors, EMP and marginal zone B-cell lymphomas share many histological and clinical similarities, with EMP having an extensive degree of plasmacytic differentiation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considered the principal growth factor in plasma cell disorders.

The occurrence of plasmacytoma at the surgical wound site may be due to direct wound contamination, host immune response, or tumor manipulation and aerosolization, among other factors. A dominant theory explaining the pathophysiology of plasmacytoma explains the increased expression of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in areas of inflammation and trauma, which is a highly potent immune cell attractant. After chemotherapy, myeloma cells expressing CXCR-4 chemokine receptors attach to SDF-1.
