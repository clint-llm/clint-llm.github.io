It is essential to diagnose hibernating myocardium in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy because symptoms of chronic LV dysfunction may not always be from necrotic and scarred myocardium from previous MIs, but rather from reversible ischemia. Hibernating myocardium may be the predominant etiology of chronic heart failure in patients with a history of known or suspected coronary artery disease, and the degree of cardiac dysfunction may not be solely accounted for by previous MIs.

The prognosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy with scarred myocardium due to previous MIs is dismal, and ventricular assist devices and cardiac transplant may be the only alternatives ultimately.
