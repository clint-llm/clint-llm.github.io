Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ADH release (SIADH) is a condition defined by the unsuppressed release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland or nonpituitary sources or its continued action on vasopressin receptors. The condition was first detected in two patients with lung cancer by William Schwartz and Frederic Bartter in 1967. They developed the classic Schwartz and Bartter criteria for diagnosing SIADH, which has not changed. SIADH is characterized by impaired water excretion leading to hyponatremia with hypervolemia or euvolemia. This activity reviews the causes, presentation, and diagnosis of SIADH and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the benign and malignant causes of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
- Describe the blood and urine features of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
- Summarize the treatment options for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome.
