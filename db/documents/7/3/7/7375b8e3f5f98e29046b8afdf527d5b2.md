Amebiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan, Entamoeba histolytica; transmitted through fecal-oral route. The infection can manifest ranging from an asymptomatic state to multiple complications associated with liver abscesses. Amebic liver abscess is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of amebiasis. Men between the ages of 18 and 50 are most commonly affected. Areas with high rates of amebic infection include India, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America. Approximately 80% of patients with this disease will develop symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks, including fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain with 10% to 35% of patients experiencing associated gastrointestinal symptoms.  The diagnosis is based on the clinical symptoms and relevant epidemiology coupled with radiographic studies and serologic tests. Optimal treatment includes the use of Metronidazole followed by a luminal agent such as Paromomycin. Rarely, therapeutic aspiration is indicated.
