Since early clinical trials in the 1960s, bleomycin pulmonary toxicity (BPT) has been a recognized adverse effect of this drug. Recent studies have described BPT rates of approximately 10% in patients taking bleomycin, with 14% of these BPT cases proving fatal. For this reason, careful monitoring for toxicities accompanied by bleomycin levels is essential. As previously described, BPT can include a serious condition known as pulmonary fibrosis. Risk factors for BPT include cumulative dose, raised creatinine, advanced age, supplemental oxygen, and reduced glomerular filtration rate. While many cases of BPT are irreversible or fatal, evidence suggests that in some surviving patients, pulmonary parameters can improve to baseline in approximately two years. Although there are no well-established therapies for reversing BPT, studies involving alternative formulations of the drug have shown promise. Numerous studies have also demonstrated that bleomycin can sometimes be substituted for less toxic chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents as a part of a multi-drug regimen, producing similar outcomes. This approach is especially useful for patients with multiple BPT risk factors and patients whose low-grade disease does not merit the risk of BPT.
