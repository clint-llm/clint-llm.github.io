The mainstays of medical treatment include:

- Diagnostic lumbar puncture: can transiently relieve symptoms or, in some cases, lead to a complete resolution.

- Weight loss: weight loss of 5 to 10% of total body weight has been found to cause remission.

- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide): decreases CSF production (up to 50%) and functions as a diuretic.

- Topiramate: classically used for migraine prophylaxis. This medication is useful because it has weak carbonic anhydrase activity and can lead to weight loss.

- Diuretics (furosemide, chlorthalidone): less effective at symptom reduction than carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors. When used with CA inhibitors, can lead to severe hypokalemia.

- Steroids: can rapidly lower ICP. Caution recommended as these can cause weight gain and rebound elevated ICP when tapered off. Steroid therapy should only be in cases with severe vision loss or in cases refractory to other medical treatments.

For cases refractory to medical treatment, surgery can be an option:

- Optic nerve sheath defenestration (optic nerve sheath decompression): involves making slits in the dura and arachnoid posterior to the globe leading to an increased outflow of CSF and decreasing pressure on the optic nerve. This operation is mainly reserved for severe vision loss that is refractory to medical management.

- CSF diversion: via either a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt.
