Some hospitals are establishing multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) to facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely treatment of patients with pulmonary embolism. A PERT is a treatment model composed of providers from different specialties involved in the treatment of PE, including pulmonary, critical care, cardiology, and cardiothoracic surgery, among others. The establishment of PERT has proven effective in multiple studies by improving communication and coordinating treatment efforts among providers.
