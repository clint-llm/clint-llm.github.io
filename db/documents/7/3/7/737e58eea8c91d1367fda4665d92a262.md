As mentioned previously, there is an indication for all staff who may be involved in rapid sequence intubation to be trained regularly on effective cricoid pressure techniques. Rapid-sequence intubation requires a team of 2 or more individuals. One individual is likely the anesthesia provider for the case, and the other individual could be any other team member involved in patient care when intubation is commonly indicated. Meta-analysis has identified that verbal instruction is inferior to hands-on methods of learning cricoid pressure techniques.
