Since multiple diseases can present with an enlarged cornea or globe, there are numerous associated causes and potential genetic inheritance patterns. Also, not all studies state whether the patient in question had other genetic abnormalities or if the defect was noted in isolation. X-linked megalocornea has been the most studied and best described in the literature and is most frequently associated with megalocornea. In 1991, the affected gene was noted to be located at the Xq13-q25 region of the X-chromosomeChordin-like 1 (CHRDL1) gene was identified as the causative locus.

In addition to X-chromosome mutations that can lead to megalocornea, autosomal chromosomes have been associated with the defect as well. Duplications in the 16p chromosomal region have resulted in megalocornea without other congenital or acquired defects.
