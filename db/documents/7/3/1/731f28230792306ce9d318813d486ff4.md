Treatment planning of many ear diseases should involve an interprofessional team, where possible. This may consist of otolaryngologists, audiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, pediatricians, or infectious disease specialists. Specialist ENT nurses are, in many countries, playing a wider role in the provision of ENT care - especially in tasks such as micro suctioning of the external auditory canal. The audiological department has an especially significant role in assessing a patient's hearing, both pre- and post-surgically, as well as with the provision of hearing aid devices.
