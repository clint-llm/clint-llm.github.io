Carotid artery dissection is a rare disorder that is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, radiologist, vascular surgeon, ICU nurses, and an internist. While the rare patient may require surgery, the majority of patients can be managed with medical therapy and endovascular stenting.

The outlook for patients who have no neurological deficit at presentation is good. The patient must be informed on the need for better blood pressure control and elimination of risk factors for atherosclerosis.
