Complications from OG may include seizure, postsurgical complications, and thromboembolic events, chemotherapy side effects including myelosuppression limiting treatment with PCV, as well as nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms with TMZ, and long-term effects of radiation, such as cognitive deficits, gait abnormalities, or radiation necrosis. Residual or recurrent OG can also undergo malignant degeneration over time.
