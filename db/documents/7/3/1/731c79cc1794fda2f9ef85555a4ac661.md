Delivering mechanical ventilation requires establishing a closed circuit between the mechanical ventilator and the patientâ€™s airways and lungs. This circuit includes the nasopharynx, oropharynx, trachea, bronchial tree, and alveoli. Invasive ventilation is achieved by endotracheal tube placement and inflation of an occlusive cuff in the trachea. Non-invasive ventilation utilizes the placement of a mask over the nose and mouth secured via a cushion and elastic straps around the head. If the endotracheal tube cuff or mask seal is not fully occlusive, this results in an air leak and decreased flow and tidal volume.
