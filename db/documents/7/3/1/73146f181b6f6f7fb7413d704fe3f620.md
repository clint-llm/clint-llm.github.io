The appropriate preparation before performing gastrojejunostomy varies depending on the indication for the procedure.

If the gastrojejunostomy is being performed after resection of malignancy, then preparation may include neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nutritional support, and planning follow-up care in conjunction with an oncology team.

If the gastrojejunostomy is being performed to bypass an obstruction such as that which might occur from an ulcer, then ensuring that the patient is not malnourished is the initial preparation. This could include consulting a nutritionist, as well as potentially starting parenteral nutrition or placing a distal feeding tube.

If the gastrojejunostomy is being performed as part of a weight-loss procedure, then the patient requires a full bariatric work-up including meeting with a dietician, establishing a preoperative weight loss plan, meeting with a psychologist or psychiatrist for evaluation, and optimizing other risk factors such as glucose and blood pressure control.
