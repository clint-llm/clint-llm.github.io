The histology of myocardial infarction changes over the time-course of the disease. At time 0, there are no microscopic histologic changes. Under light microscopy, within 0.5 to 4 hours, waviness of fibers at the periphery of the tissue is seen. Glycogen is depleted. At 4 to 12 hours, the myocardium undergoes coagulation necrosis and edema. At 12 to 24 hours, the gross specimen becomes dark and mottled. There are contraction band necrosis and neutrophil predominance on histopathology. At 1 to 3 days, there is a loss of nuclei, and at 3 to 7 days, macrophages appear to remove apoptosis cells. At 7 to10 days, granulation tissue appears. At 10 days and onward, there is collagen one deposition. After 2 months, the myocardium is scarred.
