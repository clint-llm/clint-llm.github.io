In the early stages, steatorrhea may be unrecognized by many patients due to minimal or nonspecific presenting symptoms. Therefore, the exact prevalence and incidence of steatorrhea are challenging to estimate and often go underreported. Also, the epidemiology of steatorrhea depends on the epidemiology of various underlying causes, which is a topic of the discussion below.

In adults, chronic pancreatitis is the most common cause of EPI. Chronic pancreatitis has an annual incidence of approximately 4 per 100000 persons and a prevalence of about 42 per 100000 individuals in the U.S.

The prevalence of celiac disease is on the rise, and a recent study reported a global seroprevalence of 1.4%.

Based on a study from the Netherlands, PBC had an incidence of 1.1 per 100000 (male to female ratio was 1 to 6.3), and the point prevalence was 13.2 per 100000 individuals in 2008.
