Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine receptor modulator primarily used in the FDA-approved short-term treatment of insomnia aimed at patients with difficulty starting sleep. It improves measures of sleep latency and sleep duration and reduces the number of awakenings in patients with transient insomnia. It also improves sleep quality in patients with chronic insomnia as well and can act as a minor muscle relaxant. This activity reviews the indications of zolpidem, including pharmacology, adverse events, dosing, contraindications, and the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with insomnia.
