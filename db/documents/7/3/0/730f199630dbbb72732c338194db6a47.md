Traction splint is a useful emergency tool to align the femur fracture better, increase arterial blood flow, decrease pain and spasm, and reduce the risk of further injury from fractured bone fragments.

If the patient is not stable, do not waste time trying to apply traction splint at the scene. Splint the injured leg against the uninjured leg to expedite the transport.

Frequently re-assess neurovascular function of the extremity after the application of splint and during transport.
