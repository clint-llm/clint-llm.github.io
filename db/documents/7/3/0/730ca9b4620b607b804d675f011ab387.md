There is an ongoing debate about the pathophysiology of shrinking lung syndrome in SLE. Various theories have been suggested that have sought to explain the unique clinical features of this syndrome. Hypotheses have included reduced diaphragmatic muscle thickness, diaphragmatic dysfunction due to pleural adhesions, pleural inflammation chronically impairing deep inspiration reducing lung compliance, paralysis of the phrenic nerve, alterations in surfactant,Â and myositis.
