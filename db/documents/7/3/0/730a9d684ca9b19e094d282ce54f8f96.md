Surgery aims to excise as much tumor as possible and to relieve the obstruction of the CSF. However, care should be taken during surgery as the tumor is friable and can quickly disseminate. Following surgery, more than 40% of patients have residual neurological deficits. Besides cerebellar dysfunction, others may develop mutism, cranial nerve palsies, and hemiparesis. Some symptoms do reverse with time, but extensive rehabilitation is required. At least 50% will have permanent deficits.

In most patients, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is necessary for the relief of hydrocephalus. Some patients may obtain benefits from an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Besides central venous access for medications, an Ommaya reservoir for chemotherapy is often used. However, all these procedures have risks, and technical complications are common.
