Noninvasive laboratory and diagnostic imaging tests should be exhausted first in order to spare the patient the risks, discomfort, and expense of a renal biopsy.

Guidelines from several professional medical societies regarding when to perform renal biopsies are summarized below.

**Targeted Biopsies (for renal tumors)**

- The 2018 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines state, "the recommended abdominal imaging studies provide high diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, a needle biopsy is not always necessary before surgery.  In selected individuals, needle biopsy may be considered for small lesions to establish (the) diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and guide active surveillance strategies, cryosurgery, radiofrequency (sic), and ablation strategies... (or) if a central lesion or a homogeneous infiltration of renal parenchyma is observed on scans to rule out urothelial carcinoma or lymphoma, respectively."

- The 2018 Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) guidelines address some of the technical aspects of the renal biopsy but do not address clinical decision-making issues.

- The 2016 American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines state that biopsy can be considered when it is necessary to determine whether a mass is "hematologic, metastatic, inflammatory, or infectious" (Campbell 2016).

- The 2014 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines state that "owing to the high diagnostic accuracy of current imaging, a biopsy is not necessary for the setting of localized or locally advanced disease before surgical treatment in fit patients with a long life expectancy and a highly suspicious, contrast-enhancing renal mass on CT or MRI

- The 2013 American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines address both targeted and non-targeted biopsies. For targeted biopsies, the guidelines state when a person has a normal renal function, a biopsy is appropriate when the diagnosis is still indeterminate after all three of the following tests have been performed: CT without and with contrast, MRI without and with contrast, and US with duplex Doppler.  All of these tests assess for lesion vascularity.  A biopsy is more useful and appropriate than an MRI or CT without contrast. When a person has renal insufficiency (i.e., to a degree deemed too risky for intravenous (IV) contrast based on an assessment by a nephrologist), then a biopsy can be considered the third most appropriate test, after (1) US with duplex Doppler and (2) MRI without contrast have been performed (and before CT without contrast). The ACR guidelines also suggest that masses with intermediate levels of enhancement from 10 HU to 20 HU (Hounsfield units) may be appropriate for biopsy as the next step versus other options (e.g., surveillance) based on work by Heilbrun

Enhancement of some or all of a mass to a lesser degree than the aorta is the single most important indication may be malignant.  Pre-contrast and post-contrast CT or MRI (with or without contrast subtraction technology) is needed to ascertain with confidence whether a lesion enhances.  The differential for this type of mass in the absence of evidence of fat in the lesion is primarily renal cell carcinoma (RCC) vs. oncocytoma.  The Bosniak scale is a scale based on medical imaging appearance used to estimate the likelihood that a partially cystic renal lesion is a primary renal carcinoma.  A common approach is to only biopsy Bosniak category 2F and Bosniak category 3 lesions

Other imaging characteristics that encourage proceeding to renal mass biopsy are discussed in detail by Caoili

- Infiltrative mass that preserves a reniform shape in the absence of risk factors for urinary tract infection. This should raise suspicion for lymphoma or urothelial carcinoma over standard RCC.

- Multiple enhancing masses without macroscopic fat. This should raise suspicion for lymphoma or a hereditary cancer syndrome over standard RCC.

**Non-Targeted Biopsy for Differentiating Causes of AKI or CKD**

NTBs are performed to differentiate etiologies of acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a patient who is thought to have a chance for recoverable renal function, because one etiology may have a different treatment than another.  The 2013 ACR guidelines state that, for AKI, a biopsy is the next most appropriate radiologic test after performing US of both the kidneys and bladder.  For CKD, US of the kidneys and bladder should be performed first, but biopsy is then of higher or equivalent appropriateness to any other radiologic test

For NTBs, neither the American Society of Nephrology nor the National Kidney Foundation provides guidelines in any general or specific setting, such as AKI, CKD, or post-transplant

**Other Clinical Scenarios where a Biopsy Might be Appropriate**

- A tumor is likely to be oncocytoma or RCC in a patient who has comorbidities associated with high surgical risks.  Such risks can be estimated using the American College of Surgeons calculator (riskcalculator.facs.org/RiskCalculator).  A patient with high perioperative mortality risk and with a predicted life expectancy shorter than the estimated risk of the spread of RCC to a terminal state may wish to have a confirmed tissue diagnosis of malignancy before assuming the risks of a major surgery that may not add longevity or quality of life or before choosing an alternative strategy with less chance of cure in the management of known malignancy (such as percutaneous ablation or "active" surveillance).

- An unresectable renal tumor.  As no surgical specimen will be obtained, there is no histological diagnosis.  A medical or radiation oncologist will often decline to offer treatment without a tissue diagnosis in the medical record (although applying such a rule of practice to all patients is not endorsed by the NCCN

- Multiple tumors in the kidney and/or elsewhere in the body.  Multiple metastases to the kidney are much less common than metastases from the kidney or synchronous renal primary tumors.  In the setting of two or more renal lesions having imaging features compatible with RCC, the staging of cancer should be performed by biopsying the safest lesion outside the kidney that could provide a World Health Organization stage 4 RCC diagnosis thus providing histologic confirmation of extrarenal spread of disease.  If that extra-renal biopsy results in a diagnosis of cancer that is not of renal origin, then the renal tumor should be assessed "on its own merit."  If the tumor's imaging features are compatible with RCC, then a second biopsy of the renal lesion is not needed just to prove that the lesion is truly an RCC and not a metastasis from other cancer sites

- A tumor in the setting of urologist recommendation for active surveillance over urgent treatment.  Some institutions may require patients to undergo a renal biopsy as part of a non-operative surveillance program, using histological grading of RCC to better advise patients on the chances for potential tumor growth and metastasis.  At this point, this strategy is endorsed by the EAU

- A renal tumor in the setting of tumor ablation therapy. The AUA
