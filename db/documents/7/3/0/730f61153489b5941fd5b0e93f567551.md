Adult-onset Still disease is a very uncommon disease. Its annual incidence has been estimated to be 0.1 to 0.4 cases per 100,000 people in Europe. Females are affected slightly more than males.Â It has bimodal age distribution, the first peak between the ages of fifteen to twenty-five and the second between thirty-six to forty-six. However, about three-quarters of the patients report the onset of disease between sixteen and thirty-five years of age.
