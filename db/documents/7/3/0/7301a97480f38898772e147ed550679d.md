The main risk in trapped lung patients is multiple diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for a persistent pleural effusion. This can be prevented by clinical awareness of this condition. The patient should be counseled regarding the benign nature of trapped lung once underlying malignancy is excluded and the irreversible outcome of this pleural abnormality. Further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions should be avoided unless the radiographical appearance changes and patients should be educated to reduce the risk of undergoing an ill-advised intervention in the future.
