MEN4 occurs due to CDKN1B gene mutations. Organs affected by MEN4 are discussed below.

**Parathyroid Gland**

Primary hyperparathyroidism has been reported in up to 80%-90% of cases with MEN4.

**Pituitary Gland**

The second most common presentation is pituitary adenoma (nonfunctional and functional). It is proposed that 10% of patients with MEN4 have acromegaly, and 5% of patients with MEN4 have Cushing disease. These findings are similar to MEN1.

**Neuroendocrine Gastropancreatic Tumors**

The prevalence of gastrinomas and nonfunctional pancreatic tumors in MEN4 is approximately 25%. This is much lower than MEN1. So far, there are no case reports of insulinoma, VIPoma, glucagonoma, or ectopic ACTH secreting neuroendocrine tumors in MEN4.

**Others**

There have been reports of adrenal tumors, testicular cancer, cervical carcinoma, papillary thyroid cancer, colon cancer, carcinoid, and meningioma.
