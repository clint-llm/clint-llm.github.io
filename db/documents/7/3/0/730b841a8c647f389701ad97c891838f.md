Cases of HFMD are on the rise, and clinicians need to know how to make the diagnosis. Because many recent cases have involved the brain, a neurological consult may be necessary. An interprofessional team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, or PAs), specialists (neurologist, pediatrician, internist, infectious disease expert), nursing staff, and a pharmacist should be involved. Clinicians will diagnose and initiate therapy and decide which referrals may be necessary. Pharmacists can assist with medication management, perform medication reconciliation, and answer questions about the agents used. Nurses will coordinate activities with other interprofessional team members, help with patient examination, and counsel patients and/or parents. Everyone on the team must communicate openly with the rest of the care team to ensure the best care leading to optimal outcomes. [Level 5]

The outcomes for most patients with HFMD are excellent, with full recovery occurring within 7 to 21 days. [Level 1]
