Linitis plastica needs the coordination of an interprofessional team of gastroenterologists, oncologists, gastric surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, nutritionists, and endstage nursing care. This team should plan the best strategy for each patient on a one-to-one basis because this disease is uncommon with poor prognosis. Communication with the patient and caregivers is mandatory to help in deciding what is best for the patient.

A good diagnosis starts with the radiologist and gastroenterologist, deciding to refer or formulate a team according to the case. The team will decide the best plan that suits the individual patient. Surgical gastrectomy, either partial or total with a suitable margin, is decided by the surgeon in coordination with the oncologist. Postoperative management by a nutritionist and gastroenterologist to relieve the symptoms and improve the quality of life is advisable.Â The oncologist decides the best radioactive or chemotherapeutic plan postoperative or as a palliative measure from the beginning to the advanced stages. Nursing care and social workers help the patients in different stages of the disease, especially in the late stages.

The level of evidence for LP management is mainly derived from cohort and case series studies due to the rarity of cases and the individuality of the disease.
