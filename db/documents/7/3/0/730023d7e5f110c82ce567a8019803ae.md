Alpha-1 agonists are a class of medications used in the management of many disorders, including vasodilatory shock, hypotension, hypoperfusion, septic shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, heart failure decompensation, as well as other lower acuity conditions. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for alpha-1 agonists. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients in need of alpha-1 agonistic effects.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of selected alpha-1 adrenergic agonists.
- Describe the adverse effects of selected alpha-1 adrenergic agonists.
- Outline the appropriate monitoring of selected alpha-1 adrenergic agonists.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the effective use of alpha-1 adrenergic agonists and improve outcomes.
