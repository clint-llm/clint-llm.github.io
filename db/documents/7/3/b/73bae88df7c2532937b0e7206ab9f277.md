Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that is FDA approved to treat patients suffering from hypertension. Olmesartan can be combined with other antihypertensive medications or used alone. Olmesartan, like other ARBs, can be used as monotherapy for hypertension in the absence of comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular events, heart failure, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease. ARBs can be combined with a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker to achieving normotensive goals in high-risk patients, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk greater than or equal to 10% or stage 2 hypertension. Olmesartan should not be administered with other medications that interfere with the RAAS systems, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). ARBs have been a recommendation to help lower microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes mellitus.

ARBs can also lower cardiovascular events and mortality in ischemic heart disease in clinical practice. However, ARB medications are inferior when compared to the use of ACE inhibitors.
