The diagnosis of a mallet finger is usually a clinical diagnosis. However, to distinguish between mallet finger injuries and mallet fractures, providers should obtain a three-view radiograph of the affected finger. Referring to these radiographs, one will either see a bony avulsion of the distal phalanx as in a mallet fracture, or the radiograph will be normal as in a mallet finger, the latter is due only to a ligamentous injury. The most valuable radiograph is the true lateral radiograph of the affected finger. This can help determine the size of the fracture fragment, displacement of the fracture fragment, and subluxation of the distal phalanx.
