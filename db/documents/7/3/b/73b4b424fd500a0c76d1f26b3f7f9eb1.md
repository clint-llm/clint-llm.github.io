Piezogenic papules represent a fairly distinct entity. A physical examination easily illustrates PPP and typically does not result in diagnostic confusion. Having a patient stand to evaluate pedal papules or placing pressure on their palm to unveil lesions on the volar wrist usually confirms the condition.

Infantile pedal papules have been described under many different names, including pre-calcaneal congenital fibrolipomatous hamartomas, bilateral congenital adipose plantar nodules, benign anteromedial plantar nodules of childhood, congenital piezogenic-like pedal papules, bilateral congenital fatty heel pads, and pedal papules of the newborn. These many names can complicate the terminology; however, all are thought to represent the same physiology. It is essential to distinguish the entity from juvenile aponeurotic fibroma, which typically presents a fixed, solitary, firm subcutaneous nodule that occurs most often in young children or adolescents and is more common on wrists than ankles. If the clinician is concerned a patient has juvenile aponeurotic fibroma papules, plain radiograph imaging will show stippled calcifications.
