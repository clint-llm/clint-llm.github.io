The typical presentation ofÂ Bernard-Soulier syndrome starts at birth and continues throughout life. It is characterized by bleeding from different sites, epistaxis, cutaneous bleeding, hemorrhage post-trauma, e.g., brain hemorrhage after head trauma, prolonged bleeding after dental procedures, and heavy menstrual bleeding in females.

The patients with BSS who present in adulthood are usually those with mBSS. Such patients have less number of bleeding episodes due to preserved platelet numbers.

The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool (ISTH-BAT) is a useful assessment tool for assessing bleeding disorders. Its utility was tested in a small study, including patients with known inherited platelet disorders. The study demonstrated a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 90%, and a negative predictive value of 100% with the use of this assessment tool.
