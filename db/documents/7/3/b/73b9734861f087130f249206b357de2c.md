Pericoronitis symptoms usually begin locally in the posterior mandible, near erupting third molars. Patients initially report localized pain and swelling at the back of the mouth that can change to radiating pain to the surrounding structures. The symptoms usually worsen with function and over time.

It is also important to note that patient presentation may differ based on whether patients have chronic or acute pericoronitis. Acute pericoronitis is characterized by the sudden onset of more severe signs and symptoms of inflammation in the affected intraoral region. Chronic pericoronitis presents with a long history of milder symptoms.
