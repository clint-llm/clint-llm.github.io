The Boston criteria are commonly used when evaluating patients for Cerebral amyloid angiopathy. It is a combination of clinical, pathological, and radiographic criteria that are used to assess the probability of CAA. Definitive diagnoses can only be made through a postmortem examination of the brain. However, a “probable CAA” diagnosis can be made during life utilizing imaging or tissue sampling.

**Modified Boston Criteria**

- Definite CAA (postmortem) – postmortem examination demonstrating:

- Lobar, cortical-subcortical hemorrhage, or cortical hemorrhage

- Absence of another diagnostic lesion

- Severe CAA with vasculopathy

- Probable CAA (with pathology)- clinical data and pathologic tissue demonstrating:

- Lobar, cortical-subcortical hemorrhage, or cortical hemorrhage

- Pathological evidence of CAA

- Absence of another diagnostic lesion

- Probable CAA (with imaging) – clinical data and imaging demonstrating:

- Multiple hemorrhages restricted to the cortical, lobar, or cortical-subcortical regions or

- Single lobar, cortical, or cortical-subcortical hemorrhage and focal or disseminated superficial siderosis

- Absence of another diagnostic lesion

- Age ≥55 years

- Possible CAA (with imaging) - clinical data and imaging demonstrating:

- Single hemorrhage restricted to the cortical, lobar, or cortical-subcortical region. Or diffuse, superficial siderosis

- Absence of another diagnostic lesion

- Age ≥55 years

**Imaging**

Gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most important techniques used for diagnosis. Gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates regions of low-signal blooming artifact caused by iron depositions left by old hemorrhages. Another very useful technique is a susceptibility-weighted MRI (more sensitive than gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). Using these techniques, multiple areas of hemorrhage can be identified to help support the diagnosis of CAA.

**Pathology**

Brain biopsies are rarely utilized in the diagnosis of CAA, except when CAA-related inflammation is suspected. If a sample is obtained, it should be examined with beta-amyloid immunostain or Congo red stain. Using these techniques, the deposition of amyloid beta-peptide can be identified to help support the diagnosis of CAA.
