Children with Hurler syndrome are usually not born with signs but develop symptoms during the first year of life. Developmental delay may become apparent by the age of 1 to 2 years, with a maximum functional age of 2 to 4 years. The average age of mortality is 5 years, and nearly all patients die before 10 years of age.

- General appearance: Characteristic features include coarse facies, enlarged head with prominent frontal bones, widely placed eye sockets with protruding eyes, flat appearance of the nasal bridge, enlarged lips, and wide-open eyes. The neck is typically short and stiff. These characteristic features were formerly described traditionally in the medical literature by the term gargoylism.

- Neurological manifestations: Children have a progressive developmental delay before 2 years of age and lose previously acquired skills. GAGs are deposited in the meninges and spinal cord. This results in obstruction of CSF thereby causing high pressure communicating hydrocephalus and convulsions. Odontoid dysplasia and anterior C1-C2 subluxation occur frequently and can cause cord compression and sudden death.

- Respiratory manifestations: Patients often develop frequent ear, sinus, and pulmonary infections with thick secretions that lead to frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Soft tissue thickening in the nose, pharynx, tonsils, and adenoids along with abnormalities in the tracheal cartilage causes progressive airway obstruction and sleep apnea. In some patients, sleep apnea is unrecognized and can cause significant hypoxemia at night, leading to complications like pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.

- Cardiac manifestations: These include cardiomyopathy, endocardial fibroelastosis, valvular regurgitation, and heart failure. GAG deposition within the blood vessels causes diffuse narrowing of the coronary arteries. Some untreated patients develop irregular lesions of the aorta. Most patients with severe Hurler syndrome die from heart failure before the age of 10.

- Gastrointestinal manifestations: Swallowing might become difficult due to GAG deposition in the muscle tissue of the tongue, resulting in macroglossia which might impair speech. Patients also develop umbilical and inguinal hernias within several months of life, often one of the first clinical signs. Hepatosplenomegaly is also noted.

- Musculoskeletal system: Patients may be of normal height during infancy but stop growing by the age of 2 years. They may not reach a height of greater than 4 feet. Skeletal abnormalities occur by about 6 months but become more clinically obvious by 10 to 14 months. A rapidly enlarging head size due to craniosynostosis and hyperostosis of the skull is usually seen. They may experience debilitating spine and hip deformities, abnormal bone and cartilage development (particularly spine and hands), carpal tunnel syndrome, and joint stiffness. Abnormal curvature of the lower spine, giving a hunchback appearance called Gibbus (dorsal kyphosis) deformity, is common. Patients may develop progressive joint stiffness and contractures, which limit mobility and are painful. Cervical myelopathy is seen due to congenital vertebral anomalies and atlantoaxial subluxation. Vertebral bodies are characteristically hypoplastic and show anteroinferior beaking on radiological examination. Patients usually develop typical skeletal abnormalities, known as dysostosis multiplex.

- Ocular manifestations: Clouding of the cornea occurs due to structural alteration of the corneal stroma and derangement of collagen fibrils thereby leading to blindness. Retinal degeneration and optic nerve compression can also occur within the first year of life.

- Hearing manifestations: GAGs build up in tubes of the middle ear and further prevent them from draining properly, leading to recurrent ear infections. Patients usually develop combined conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.

- Integumentary manifestations: Hair is often coarse and more abundant than in normal children. Bluish birthmarks known as Mongolian spots are common.
