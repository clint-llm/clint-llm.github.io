The MCP joints play a critical role in the functionality of the human hand. The MCP joint of the thumb is structurally and functionally similar to the MCP joints of the other digits; however, there are differences and these will be noted when relevant. The thumb MCP joint is a hinge joint that allows up to 80 to 90 degrees of flexion with minimal extension, adduction, or abduction.

The shape of the MCP joint provides minimal intrinsic stability. The joint is primarily stabilized by ligaments, the joint capsule, and the surrounding musculotendinous balance.

The volar plate is a dense fibrocartilaginous thickening of the palmar aspect of the MCP joint capsule. The volar plate’s primary function is to prevent hyperextension of the joint.

A collateral ligament, comprised of a proper collateral ligament and an accessory collateral ligament, is present on both the radial and ulnar aspects of each MCP joint. The proper collateral ligaments are strong cord-like structures that act as the primary stabilizers of the MCP joint. The proper collateral ligaments originate from the lateral-dorsal aspect of the metacarpal head and transverse the joint to insert onto the volar margin of the adjacent proximal phalange. The accessory collateral ligaments originate more volar and proximal than the proper collateral ligament and fan outward in an oblique direction to insert onto the distal third of the volar plate.

The joint capsule surrounds the MCP joint blending with the palmar plate and the collateral ligaments. It functions to stabilize the joint dorsally and is taut in joint flexion.

Sagittal bands arise from the plantar plate and wrap around the MCP joint superficially creating a “lasso” around the underlying extensor muscle tendon. This structure allows the extensor muscle to extend the MCP joint despite minimal attachment to the proximal phalanx.
