Here are important points to take note of:

- Knowledge of trapped lung is crucial for physicians as many of these patients are subjected to repeated thoracentesis, managed with chest tubes, resulting in prolonged hospitalization.

- Trapped lung should be suspected in any patient with a chronic stable pleural effusion, particularly if there is a history of pneumonia, pneumothorax, hemothorax, thoracic surgery, or malignancy.

- Ultrasound is a rapid and cost-effective way of diagnosing pleural effusion.

- Once the diagnosis of a trapped lung is made, the need for pleural drainage must be assessed based on the clinical circumstances on a case-by-case basis.

- High pleural space elastance (change in pressure/change in volume) exceeding 14.5 cm HO/L is the hallmark of a trapped lung.

- Decortication of visceral pleura by VATS might allow reexpansion of the trapped lung to some degree and aid in the resolution of the trapped lung.
