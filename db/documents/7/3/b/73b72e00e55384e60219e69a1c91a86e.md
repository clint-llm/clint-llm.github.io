Rebreathers add complexity and potential for error over open circuit dive equipment, but they allow additional operational benefits to the diver, such as decreased gas utilization, increased bottom time, and stealthy excursions. In the underwater exploration world, unexpected events often add time to a dive, sometimes at the maximum depth of a dive. Traditionally, this unexpected time has resulted in the depletion of emergency gas supplies and resulted in both near misses and fatalities. A rebreather can substantially reduce the time pressure on the diver as it can literally extend dive time several hours
