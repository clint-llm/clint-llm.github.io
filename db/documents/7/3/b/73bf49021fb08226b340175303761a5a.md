The nasal septum is the midline supporting structure of the nose and nasal cavity. There are four major components of the nasal septum: the maxillary crest, the vomer, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, and the quadrangular cartilage. The septum rests atom the maxillary spine and columellar skin inferiorly, the nasal bones, nasal cartilages, and scroll dorsally, and the entry of the nasopharynx posteriorly, spanning the entire nasal cavity. The bony and cartilaginous components of the bone are covered with periosteum and perichondrium, respectively, and the entire septum is lined with mucosa. The mucosa of the nasal septum has a robust vascular supply. The mucosa consists of pseudostratified columnar epithelium.

The nasoseptal flap is a pedicled flap based on the nasoseptal artery, a branch of the posterior septal artery which originates from the sphenopalatine branch of the internal maxillary artery.

While the mucosa and perichondrium are elevated off of the bony and cartilaginous septum, the bare areas of the nasal septal cartilage and bone will re-mucosalize provided the contralateral side is intact. The superior most aspect of the nasal septum acts not only to moisten and line the nasal cavity but also to aid in olfaction. The superior-most 1 to 2 cm of nasal septal mucosa are olfactory epithelium and contain receptors and nerves of the first cranial nerve.
