Decelerations are temporary decreases in the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor. Hon and Quilligan first described three types of decelerations (early, variable, and late) in 1967Â based on the shape and timing of decelerations relative to uterine contractions.

Early deceleration is defined as a symmetrical decrease and return of fetal heart rate (FHR) that is associated with a uterine contraction. The decrease is gradual and defined by the onset of deceleration to a nadir of 30 seconds or longer, with the nadir occurring at the same time as the peak of the uterine contraction. In most instances, the onset, nadir, and recovery of the deceleration coincide with the onset, peak, and end of the contraction.
