Ketamine use continues both medically and recreationally. Practitioners use it in anesthesiology, acute and chronic pain medicine, psychiatry, and veterinary medicine. In patients who misuse ketamine, the likelihood of serious sequelae, including end-stage organ damage, increases significantly. It is incumbent upon healthcare practitioners, including nurse practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, to prevent acute complications from ketamine use and monitor and treat cognitive impairment, psychomimetic effects, and other associated adverse events associated with ketamine intoxication. Working with the clinicians, it is essential to educate patients and, in some cases, the families on the safe use of this medication.

In conclusion, ketamine toxicity and addiction pose significant risks to a small segment of the population, and given increasing utilization, the prevalence of these phenomena is expected to increase. As a schedule III controlled substance, the various formulations of ketamine are not as tightly regulated as most opioids, which, along with the low risk for fatal overdose, warrants increased attention by both regulatory bodies and practitioners on the front-line combating pain and depression.

Patients who need ketamine medically or who misuse the drug are best managed by an interprofessional team that can provide monitoring, counsel, and information regarding the drug. This team includes physicians, mid-level practitioners (i.e., NPs, PAs), pharmacists, and nurses. This interprofessional approach increases the chances of optimal patient care and outcomes. [Level 5]
