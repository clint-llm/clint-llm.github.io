Post-traumatic hand stiffness is a common presentation to healthcare professionals. These patients will present with a spectrum of different signs and symptoms that require a multidisciplinary team approach to achieve optimal outcomes. Following acute trauma, the patient will usually be seen assessed in the Emergency Room. Depending on the type and the severity of the injury sustained, different specialists' input will be required. Nurses play an important role in the Emergency Room, ensuring that the patients’ vitals are taken and analgesia given and taking a role in the management of acute injury to the hand with the reduction of fractures and splinting. Radiologists are required to facilitate the diagnosis of bony injuries. These professionals will then refer patients to Orthopaedic or Plastic specialist teams as appropriate.

Management of the stiff hand requires co-ordinated care between surgeons, specialist nurses, and hand therapists to aid in patient education and treatment adherence. Impairment of hand function can significantly impact a patient’s quality of life and ability to work; therefore, the psychological impact of such injuries needs to be recognized. A systematic review found that people with lower incomes and levels of education are more likely to take longer to return to work.
