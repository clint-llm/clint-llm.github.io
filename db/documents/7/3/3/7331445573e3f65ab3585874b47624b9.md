In appropriate situations, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is preventable. Patients should be educated about HAPE if they have been found to have pulmonary edema in the setting of a rapid increase in altitude, as these patients risk a 60% chance of recurrence with a rapid ascent to greater than 4500 meters. Salicylate toxicity is a consideration in those with chronic use, and opioid users should receive education about the adverse effects of chronic opioid use and the possible sequela of pulmonary edema.
