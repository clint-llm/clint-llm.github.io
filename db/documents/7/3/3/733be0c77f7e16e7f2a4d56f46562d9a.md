Percutaneous transcatheter left ventricular closure is usually an emergent intervention. Ideally, on or before the day of the procedure the patient should receive instructions to fast at least 6 to 8 hours before the procedure starting. Anticoagulation should also be held prior to the procedure. If the patient is on warfarin, it will need to be held, and the patient must reach an international normalized ratio (INR) of at least 1.7 or less prior to or the day of the procedure. Also, before performing the PTC, right heart catheterization and/or left heart catheterization should be done to assess the pressures inside the heart and in the lungs. Additionally, a left ventriculogram is performed to assess the function and structure of the left ventricular wall. An anesthesiologist evaluation is optimal to determine the success of intubation and extubation. One case of a PVC of LVP in a child is an excellent example of the importance of the pre-procedure cardiac imaging in providing vital information to allow detailed planning of a management strategy for an unusual left ventricular pseudoaneurysm.
