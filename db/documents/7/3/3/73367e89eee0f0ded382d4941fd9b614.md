Acknowledging that dipyridamole administration mediates an appropriate increase in perfusion, similar to that of exercise, the clinical significance of a dipyridamole nuclear stress test is highly dependent on the diagnostic values of the devices that monitor myocardial perfusion. A systematic review reported that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of single-photon emission computed tomography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 76% to 88%), 76% (95%CI: 70% to 82%) and 83% (95%CI: 77% to 89%), respectively.
