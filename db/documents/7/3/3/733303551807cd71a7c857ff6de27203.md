Pyramidal tract autopsy studies showed variabilities on many levels of its course, including the pyramidal decussation. In some cases, pyramidal decussation was absent, while in other cases, only partial decussation was present. Moreover, fibers from each hemisphere could cross at different levels, asÂ fibers from the left pyramid could decussate at a more cranial level and in higher numbers compared to its counterpart on the right side.
