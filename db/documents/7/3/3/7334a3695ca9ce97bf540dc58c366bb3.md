Due to the prevalence of receptors through which cannabis can act along the neurological and gastrointestinal organ systems to mediate vomiting, it seems paradoxical that a drug used as an antiemetic for a variety of conditions, including multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy-induced vomiting, and even cyclic vomiting syndrome could cause such distressing episodes of vomiting. The present hypothesis is that CHS may result from chronic overstimulation of endocannabinoid receptors, leading to derangements in the body’s intrinsic control of nausea and vomiting.

Probably, a crucial factor in the genesis of CHS is the composition of cannabis. Since the 1990s, there has been a progressive change in the composition of the plant, with increases in the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and a reduction of cannabidiol (CBD).
