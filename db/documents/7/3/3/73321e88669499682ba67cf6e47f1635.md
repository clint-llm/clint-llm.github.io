While the dysregulation of enkephalins has implications in the pathophysiology of various disease states, there is no widely available assay for either the diagnosis or prognosis of the associated disease entities which have been studied experimentally in both animal and human subjects. Historically immunoassay was regularly used to measure enkephalin levels in various tissues of interest quantitatively. Mass spectrographic techniques were later successfully developed and coupled to both capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography. Ozlap et al. describe the application of liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy for quantifying both leu-enkephalin and met-enkephalin in human plasma.
