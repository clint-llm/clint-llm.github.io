Varicose veins are caused by poorly functioning venous valves and decreased elasticity of the vein wall hindering flow and allowing the pooling of blood within the veins. These veins begin to pool and become engorged. Varicose veins affect up to 40% of adults and are more common in obese people and in multiparous women. Worsening varicose veins can present with pain and can contribute to decreased quality of life. Endovenous laser ablation is a minimally-invasive and well-tolerated procedure that can help to treat varicose veins and improve venous circulation.
