Patient length of stay is consistently demonstrated to decrease when an interprofessional team approach is used for rounding. On average, the length of stay is shown to decrease from 1.1 to 2.2 days per admission. Increased communication between providers and the inclusion of safety conversations in rounds leads to a reduction in adverse events and delays in the initiation of appropriate therapy, which translates into improved mortality rates. Other markers for morbidity, including weaning days, total days of mechanical ventilation, and prevention of complications such as stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, falls, skin breakdown, infection, and readmissions, also show significant improvement with the interprofessional approach.Â Staff satisfaction is also significantly improved with interprofessional rounds. This is based on satisfaction surveys, with one study showing satisfaction increasing from 86% to 95% among ICU staff. Furthermore, participants in interprofessional rounds have a greater understanding of patient care, more effective communication, and a better sense of teamwork than providers of traditional rounds.

The primary goal of healthcare providers within a hospital setting is to deliver standardized, evidence-based care and achieve maximum patient safety. Also, goals include decreased adverse events, increased patient satisfaction, decreased length of stay, and decreased mortality. This challenge has proven particularly difficult within intensive care units as many of the most severely ill patients with complex medical pathologies and the poorest prognoses are admitted to these wards. However, through the implementation of interprofessional rounds and by using a collaborative team-based approach, patient outcomes can be optimized.
