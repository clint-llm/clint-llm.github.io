The diagnosis and management of brain cavernous hemangioma are not always simple and is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, and a pathologist. The patient may first present to the primary care provider or nurse practitioner with CNS symptoms, depending on the location. The management of these lesions is best left to the neurosurgeon. Asymptomatic lesions can be observed but symptomatic lesions need some type of surgery. Depending on their location, complications from surgery are not uncommon. The prognosis for symptomatic patients who undergo surgery is guarded as a number of them are left with permanent neurological deficits.
