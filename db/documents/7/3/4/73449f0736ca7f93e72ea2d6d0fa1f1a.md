The facial and trigeminal nerves carry out the innervation of the face. Whereas the facial nerve provides the motor innervation to the facial expression muscles, the trigeminal nerve is mainly the source of sensory stimulation. Also, it supplies motor function to the mastication muscles. The sensory map of the face is further divided into the three main branches of the trigeminal nerve: ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular. The ophthalmic nerve provides sensory and parasympathetic innervation to the eye region, and the maxillary nerve innervates mainly below the eye extending to the upper lip. Finally, the third division of the trigeminal nerve, the mandibular nerve, supplies sensory innervation to the territory correlating with the mandibular bone. This nerve gives rise to a terminal branch: the mental nerve responsible for providing sensory innervation to the oral mucosa, lower lip, and the skin of the chin ventral to its foramen
