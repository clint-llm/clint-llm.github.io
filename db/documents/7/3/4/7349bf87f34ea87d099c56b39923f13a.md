The pain relieved by sympathetic block is classified as sympathetically mediated pain (SMP) that consists of abnormal connections between sympathetic and sensory nervous systems.

The therapeutic effects of SGB are due to the block in neural connections in its region of innervation, the improvement in the blood supply of the region, the reduction of adrenal hormones plasma concentration. SGB can be used in medical conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder or a cluster headache based on its sedative effect. SGB can be used as a diagnostic tool to confirm an SMP.
