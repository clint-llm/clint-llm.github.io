Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme that degrades circulating triglycerides in the bloodstream. These triglycerides are embedded in veryÂ low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and in chylomicrons that travel through the bloodstream. Lipoprotein lipase is an extracellular enzyme and is found on the vascular endothelial surface, anchored to capillary walls. It is predominantly in adipose tissue, muscle, and heart tissue but it is not present in the liver, as the liver has hepatic lipase. Lipoprotein functions to convert triglycerides to fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids liberated from the triglycerides are then used for storage in adipose tissue or for fuel in skeletal or cardiac muscle. Lipoprotein lipase requires apolipoprotein-CII, a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase, which is carried by a chylomicron as well as by very low-density lipoprotein and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), for activation. Lipoprotein lipase will shrink the chylomicrons by removing the fatty acids from triglycerides, and the fatty acids are transferred to adipocytes and skeletal muscle, while the chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
