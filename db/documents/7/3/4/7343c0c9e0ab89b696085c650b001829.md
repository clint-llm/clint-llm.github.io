Treatment is dependent on the severity and etiology of rupture, as well as the hemodynamic stability of the patient.

Non-operative treatment is attempted in 60% to 90% of patients with blunt traumatic splenic injuries out of a desire to preserve splenic function.

Interventional radiology may be available at some institutions as a means to perform arterial embolization for large or small vessel injuries with bleeding in stable trauma patients. This is also an option in patients who fail conservative management.

Exploratory laparotomy is, however, indicated if continuing hemodynamic instability or if the patient has required more than 4 units of blood during a 48-hour period. The initial choice in surgical management is to repair any capsular lacerations (splenorrhaphy). If extensive injury or uncontrolled hemorrhage is present, splenectomy is warranted. Post-splenectomy vaccinations are intended to address encapsulated organisms ( Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitides.). Children who have a splenectomy are generally recommended to take phenoxymethylpenicillin (Pen VK) until they are 5 years old, though the recommended duration of this prophylaxis varies. This is based on a prior study of sickle cell patients.
