The radial nerve bifurcates into deep and superficial branches along the lateral border of the cubital fossa, just distal to the elbow. The former, also called the posterior interosseous nerve, courses through the supinator muscle and supplies it as well as the extensor muscles of the wrist and digits. Thus, injury proximal to this bifurcation can be expected to manifest not merely as a radial nerve palsy but also as a radial nerve sensory derangement. The radial nerve appears to be vulnerable to entrapment at the level of the supinator muscle. Radial head entrapment can be proximal to the elbow at the head of the triceps muscle, in which case a deficit in elbow extension may accompany the wrist drop.
