Laboratory evaluation should be tailored according to the suspected substances ingested. Iron studies in patients with pica should be performed, especially in women who are pregnant, and children. Lead (in pica for paint and chalk) and zinc levels should be checked where appropriate.

Imaging studies are usually required when patients have abdominal symptoms. This may include plain abdominal x-rays, barium studies, and endoscopy. In many cases, serial studies are needed to ensure that the substance has passed.
