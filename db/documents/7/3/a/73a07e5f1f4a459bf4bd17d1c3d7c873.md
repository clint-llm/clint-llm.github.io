Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by uncontrolled hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and increased body ketone concentration. It is a life-threatening complication of diabetes and is usually seen in patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus. Rarely it may also occur in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. DKA is a state of a relative or absolute insulin deficiency that is worsened by hyperglycemia, dehydration, and acidosis. In most cases, the trigger is an infection, new-onset diabetes, or lack of compliance with treatment. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients suffering from this disorder in order to achieve the best outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Describe the management of a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Summarize the abnormal laboratory parameters in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among an interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by diabetic ketoacidosis.
