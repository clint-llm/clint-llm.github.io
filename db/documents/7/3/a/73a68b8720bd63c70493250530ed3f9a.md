# Continuing Education Activity

Bone age assessment can be of utmost importance in various complicated situations involving medical, surgical, forensic, and legal issues. Apart from the ability to assess the chronological age of a person, the evaluation of growth remaining in a person can be extremely beneficial to a clinician in different circumstances. Bone age can be visualized by several techniques including plain x-rays and various scans. This activity reviews the, techniques, indications and clinical relevance of assessing bone age and how the clinical team might effectively use the information attained.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in assessing bone age.
- Describe the indications for determining bone age.
- Review the clinical relevance of determining bone age.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in determining bone age and how it can lead to improved outcomes.

# Introduction

1. Visualization by hand & wrist plain film radiographs: Standard posteroanterior (PA) view of the hand and wrist; Effective radiation received during each exposure is between 0.0001-0.1 mSV.

Techniques:

A. Greulich and Pyle (GP) atlas

B. Tanner Whitehouse (TW2) Method

C. Gilsanz and Ratibin (GR) Atlas

D. Automated skeletal bone age assessment

- Stage 1: Pre-processing: Image normalized to grayscale, background removed and re-oriented

- Stage 2: Segmentation: Desired parts of image separated from the background

- Stage 3: Analysis: Selected regions of interest analyzed for bone age by TW2 method or GP atlas

Recently developed software computes bone age by both GP and TW2 methods, which has demonstrated validity across different ethnicities.

E. Capito-hamate planimetry [Choi et al. (2018)]

2. Visualization by ultrasound (US)

3. Visualization by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

4.  Visualization of elbow ossification

5. Visualization of humeral head ossification

- Stage 1 includes an incompletely ossified lateral epiphysis

- Stage 2 demonstrates increased ossification of the lateral epiphysis, with a lateral curved margin

- Stages 3 to 5 demonstrate collinearity between lateral margin of epiphysis and metaphysis; in stage 3, the lateral half of the physis is open without obvious fusion, in stage 4, the lateral half of physis is partly fused, and in stage 5, the lateral half of physis is completely fused

It has been demonstrated that peak height velocity (PHV) correlates between stages 2 and 3.

6. Visualization of the clavicle

7. Visualization of iliac bone

A. By pelvic radiographs: Risser sign - Based on the ossification of iliac crest apophysis. However, not a reliable or commonly used technique.

B. Non-ionizing Imaging: Ultrasonography as a technique to assess bone age using iliac crest apophysis ossification - has also been considered. However, this technique still requires validation.

8. Visualization of the femoral head

9. Modified Oxford Score

10. Calcaneal apophyseal ossification

- Stage 1 - Apophysis covers less than 50% of the metaphysis

- Stage 2 - Apophysis covers more than 50% of the metaphysis

- Stage 3 - Apophysis has extended fully over the plantar surface and continues to extend over the dorsal surface without evidence of fusion

- Stage 4 - Fusion of the apophysis to metaphysis begins

- Stage 5 - Fusion is complete

Calcaneal stages 0 to 2 corresponded to high chances of the contralateral slip in SCFE and stage 3  corresponds closely to PHV

11. Visualization of cervical maturation

13. Chondrocyte physiology: The thyroid hormone regulates the growth and maturation of bones by regulating cartilage proliferation, differentiation, and osteogenesis. It facilitates growth hormone action. Cartilage is made up of cells (chondroblasts and chondrocytes) and extracellular matrix (10% aggrecan, 75% water, collagen, and other constituents). Chondroblasts initially secrete the extracellular matrix, inside which they become trapped and mature into chondrocytes. The outermost layer of cartilage is a layer of dense irregular connective tissue called perichondrium, which is constituted by an inner layer of chondroblasts and an outer layer of fibroblasts. In growing cartilage, chondrocytes divide and develop into nests of 2 to 4 cells. These cells are situated in matrix-enclosed compartments called lacunae. The size of its lacuna is a good criterion in deciding whether a chondrocyte is young or old. The larger the lacuna, the older the chondrocyte and vice versa. Active, young chondrocytes are secretory and contain basophilic cytoplasm with the rich, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Older chondrocytes contain fat droplets.

# Indications

Bone age assessment is a requirement in the following:

- Endocrine/metabolic/pediatric conditions 
- Diagnosis and management of endocrine disorders 
- Evaluation of metabolic growth disorders (tall/short stature)
- Deceleration of maturity in various syndromic disorders; and
- Assessment of treatment response in various developmental disorders

- Bone malformations and skeletal dysplasias for medicolegal purposes in children and adults: estimation of chronological age when accurate birth records are not available, immigration and other lawsuits, competitive sports, etc.

- Computing the final height of normal, healthy children

- Management of orthopedic conditions in children and adolescents

- Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)

# Clinical Significance

Bone age assessment: Best imaging - based on age:

- Children less than 18 years:  Left hand and wrist radiograph

- 18-22 years: Medial end of the clavicle (CT versus MRI); sexual, dental, and hand maturity indicators are of not much use in this age group

Specific clinical significance of skeletal indicators in orthopedic surgery:

Scoliosis

- Phase 1 - 0 to 5 years

- Phase 2 - 5 to 10 years

- Phase 3 is beyond 10 years

The most rapid growth happens during phases 1 and 3. Curve acceleration phase (CAP) is a time of rapid change in curve magnitude, and patterns of curve progression have been described as low, moderate, and rapid. Sanders et al.[

Risk factors for curve progression (at presentation) include a curve of magnitude greater than 25° before skeletal maturity will continue to progress after skeletal maturity, greater than 50° thoracic curve will progress at the rate of 1 to 2° per year, and greater than 40° lumbar curve will progress at the rate of 1 to 2° per year. Other risk factors for curve progression are remaining skeletal growth, younger age (less than 12 years) at presentation, Tanner stage (less than 3 for females), Risser stage (0-1), and open triradiate cartilage. Peak growth velocity is considered the best predictor of curve progression. In females, growth spurt occurs just before menarche and before Risser 1. Also, if the curve is greater than 30° before peak height velocity, there is a strong likelihood of the need for surgery. The thoracic curve is more likely to progress than lumber. Double major curves are more likely to progress than single curves.

Limb length discrepancies

SCFE: The modified Oxford bone age score (16-18) has been described as the best predictor of contralateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis in patients with unilateral SCFE.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Bone age assessment can be of utmost importance in various complicated situations involving medical, surgical, forensic, and legal issues. Apart from the ability to assess the chronological age of a person, the evaluation of growth remaining in a person can be extremely beneficial to a clinician in different circumstances, as previously discussed. Although the role of hand X-ray in skeletal maturity estimation is well-known, evaluation of multiple other radiographs can be more beneficial in certain circumstances [e.g., Oxford hip score and calcaneal apophysis in slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)]. The evidence on this subject is still not extensive, and future research can pave the way for a better understanding of each of these skeletal assessment modalities. Future research can also help us with developing newer modalities, not involving significant radiation exposure for regular assessment of bone age in young children and adolescents. Also, more automated software to assess bone age can revolutionize this field substantially.

The radiologist plays a vital role in the assessment of bone age. However, patient management also involves an extensive inter-professional team of specialists, including family physicians, endocrinologists, orthopedists, or forensic experts. Nurses are also a vital part of the treating team as they can help coordinate the long-term management of these children.

Level of Evidence - The majority of the studies - are based on Level V (or level IV) evidence.
