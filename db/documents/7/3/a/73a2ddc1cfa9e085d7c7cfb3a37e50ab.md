**Treatment of Complications of Chronic Kidney Disease**

Patients with CKD have diminished ability to maintain a fluid balance after a rapid sodium load and becomes more apparent in stages IV and V of CKD. These patients respond to sodium restriction and a loop diuretic. The 2012 KDIGO guidelines recommend all CKD patients should be sodium restricted to less than 2 gm per day.

Hyperkalemia in CKD can occur specifically in oliguric patients and in whom where aldosterone secretion is diminished. Dietary intake of potassium, tissue breakdown and hypoaldosteronism could result in hyperkalemia. Drugs such as ACE inhibitors and nonselective beta-blockers could also result in hyperkalemia.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of advanced CKD due to the increased tendency of kidneys in CKD to retain H. Chronic metabolic acidosis in CKD would result in osteopenia, increased protein catabolism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. These patients should be treated with bicarbonate supplementation to target serum bicarbonate of equal to 23.

CKD is a significant risk factor for CVD and risk increases with increased severity of the CKD. Considerable evidence indicates a significant association between Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness and the incidence of CVD events in CKD patients. In CKD patients, EAT assessment could be a reliable parameter for cardiovascular risk assessment.

**Bone and Mineral Disorders**

Hyperphosphatemia is a frequent complication of CKD due to a decreased filtered load of phosphorous. This leads to increased secretion of a Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and causes secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism results in the normalization of phosphorous and calcium but at the expense of bone. This results in renal osteodystrophy. Therefore, phosphorus binders along with dietary restriction of phosphorus are used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Hypertension is a manifestation of volume expansion in CKD. Patients in CKD do not always have edema to suggest volume expansion. Therefore, all patients with CKD should have a loop diuretic added to control the blood pressure which needs to be titrated before considering an increase in antihypertensive therapy.

Anemia in CKD is usually normocytic normochromic. It is primarily due to reduced erythropoietin production from reduced functioning renal mass and also due to reduced red cell survival. Hemoglobin should be checked at least yearly in CKD 3, every 6 months in CKD IV and V, and every 3 months in dialysis patients. Erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA) in CKD patients should be considered when Hb is less than 10 and provided iron saturation is at least 25% and ferritin greater than 200 ng/mL. In dialysis patients, the goal Hb concentration is 10 to 11.5 gm/dl.

**Treatment of Complications of ESRD**

Malnutrition in ESRD is due to anorexia and poor protein intake. The diet in ESRD should provide at least 30 to 35 Kcal/kg per day. A low plasma albumin concentration is suggestive of malnutrition.

Uremic bleeding is a complication resulting from impaired platelet function. It results in prolonged bleeding time. Asymptomatic patients are not treated. However, correction of uremic platelet dysfunction is needed during active bleeding, need for a surgical procedure. Some interventions used are desmopressin (dDAVP), cryoprecipitate, estrogen, and initiation of dialysis.

Uremia can present as uremic pericarditis and is an indication for initiation of dialysis. Uremic pericarditis is treated with dialysis and responds well.

**Complications of Renal Transplantation**

Complications related to cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems.

Common complications include hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease from new-onset diabetes mellitus and renal failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias,
