**Short term**: Any buildup of fluid between the split-thickness skin graft and wound bed will jeopardize skin graft take, including seroma, hematoma, and infection. Shear or traction injury also disrupts skin graft healing. The graft can have incomplete (less than 100%) take or complete nontake.

**Long term:**Wound contracture and aesthetic issues, including pigmentary and texture differences between the skin-graft and donor site, are common.

**Skin graft take:**Split-thickness skin graft take is consistently reported at around 70 to 90%, even when accounting for a variety of recipient wound beds.
