Managing heart failure patients requires a multi-disciplinary and interprofessional team involving cardiologists, critical care and primary care clinicians (including NPs and PAs), registered nurses, pharmacists, social workers, physical therapists, and rehabilitation. Until 2022, treatment for patients with obstructive HCM was mainly directed to provide symptomatic relief with either pharmacologic treatment or interventional approaches such as septal reduction therapies. Mavacamten is a first-in-class molecule developed to directly target the underlying pathophysiology of obstructive HCM.

Interprofessional strategies will enhance patient outcomes. The prescribing clinician may wish to consult with a cardiology-specialized pharmacist to determine the appropriateness ofÂ mavacamten for a particular patient; potential drug-drug interactions can be addressed collaboratively at this time. Nursing will provide patient counseling and answer questions regarding the drug, and the pharmacist can reinforce these points when dispensing.

Any member of the interprofessional team who notices a change in the case needs to be able to reach out to other team members to ensure optimal patient care and to keep everyone involved in the patient's case on the same page, making notations in the patient's record as appropriate. Therapists must also report any changes in patient status so adjustments to the patient's regimen can be made if necessary; this interprofessional paradigm will result in better outcomes. [Level 5]

The use of mavacamten is associated with improving the NYHA symptomatic class and several hemodynamic and structural parameters. FDA's approval of mavacamten for utilization in patients with obstructive HCM and symptomatic heart failure permits a new therapeutic alternative for this population of heart failure patients.

Understanding the pharmacologic and cardiovascular impact of mavacamten is paramount for guiding, monitoring, and adjusting treatment in patients with obstructive HCM. In addition, several trials are currently evaluating the use of mavacamten in patients with non-obstructive HCM and in patients with obstructive HCM who met the criteria for interventional therapy to assess safety and efficacy.
