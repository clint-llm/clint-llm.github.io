There are no absolute contraindications for chest tube placement.

Relative contraindications include bleeding diathesis due to anticoagulation, coagulopathy, etc. Consideration and care should be taken amongst those patients who have previously had surgery performed on their thorax and/or an open cardiac procedure. Similarly, patients with a history of pleurodesis require additional evaluation to ensure that the chest tube will be placed in an area of the chest wall unlikely to have adhered to the lung parenchyma.
