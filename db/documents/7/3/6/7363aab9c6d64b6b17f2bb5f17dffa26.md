Knowledge of regional anatomy is essential for comprehending how the spread of the infection takes place. Ludwig angina typically initiates at the floor of the mouth and rapidly extends to the submandibular space.

The infection may eventually extend to the parapharyngeal space, retropharyngeal space, and superior mediastinum via the styloglossus muscle.

**Microbiology**

The disease is usually polymicrobial and involves oral flora, both aerobes and anaerobes. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Actinomyces are the most common organisms.Streptococcus anginosus progresses the disease more rapidly than other bacteria.Klebsiella pneumoniae.Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.
