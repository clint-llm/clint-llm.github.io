Required equipment includes:

**Skin Disinfectant**

- Usually alcohol, but other skin disinfectants may be used

**Local Anesthetic**

- Most commonly xylocaine, 0.5-2 %

- Buffering 1:9 with sodium bicarbonate significantly decreases the pain of injection

**Gauze**

**Biopsy Instrument (usually one of the following)**

- Biopsy punch

- #15 scalpel blade

- Flexible hand-held surgical blade or razor blade

- Small scissors for skin tags or other small, protuberant lesions, especially on thin skin

**Specimen Fixative**

Most often formalin, but specific tests such as direct immunofluorescence and viral or other cultures require other media.

**Hemostatic Agent**

- Aluminum chloride solution is most commonly used, but other agents such as Monsel's ferric subsulfate solution may be used.

**Sterile Ointment and Bandage Material**

- Sterile petrolatum is preferred as there is no significant difference in infection vs topical antibiotic, but much less chance of causing an allergic reaction.

- Non-stick surgical dressing and hypoallergenic tape
