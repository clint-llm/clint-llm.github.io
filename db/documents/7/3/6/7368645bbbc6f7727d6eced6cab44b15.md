The scan should possibly be performed according to international standards and by accredited sonographers who have completed appropriate training programs by scientific societies.

A sonologist, a physician with training and experience in this field, supervises and interprets the exams. It is the physician's responsibility to write a report based on the sonographer's data and, if necessary, personally scanning the patient to validate or change the differential diagnosis.
