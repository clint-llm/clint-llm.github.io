There are many types of adrenergic agents, and clinicians, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who prescribe these agents, should be aware of their side effects and contraindications. Management requires an interprofessional team approach to drug therapy with these drugs since they cover such a broad spectrum of indications and effects, both therapeutic and adverse. It is essential to consult with a pharmacist if there is any question about the use of an adrenergic agent; this can include drug-drug interactions, appropriate dosing based on the condition treated, and adverse event profile. Nurses can also access this resource as they will often administer the drugs inpatient and will need to know what signs to watch for in the event of an adverse reaction of any sort.

All interprofessional team embers must document any changes in patient status in the patient's medical record and communicate their findings to other team members so therapeutic adjustments can be made. An interprofessional team approach is vital to coordinate the care of patients taking these medications safely and effectively. [Level 5]
