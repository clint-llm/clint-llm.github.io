Kupffer cells (also known as stellate sinusoidal macrophages or Kupffer-Browicz cells) are macrophages found in the sinusoids of the liver. Kupffer cells make up 80% to 90% of all the macrophages in the entire human body.

Differentiation of Kupffer cells is regulated by macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSFs) found in the serum and liver, as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSFs).
