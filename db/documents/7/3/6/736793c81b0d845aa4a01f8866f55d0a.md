**CAMT**

Once pancytopenia develops, the prognosis of CAMT patients is poor. A study has shown 30% of CAMT patients die from bleeding complications, and another 20% die from complications related to HSCT.

**AAMT**

In AAMT, patients can achieve remission immediately after targeted therapy or develop a long relapsing and remitting course. However, more commonly, patients progress to aplastic anemia or require HSCT to achieve remission.
