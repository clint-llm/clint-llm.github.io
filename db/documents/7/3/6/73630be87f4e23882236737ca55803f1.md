The following is a non-exhaustive list of conditions in which there is an imbalance between bone modeling and remodeling.

**Osteoporosis**

The most common metabolic disorder of the skeleton is osteoporosis, a decrease in bone mass that increases the risk of bone fracture. The porous network of the trabecular bone beneath the cortical bone is particularly weakened in osteoporosis. This means that the bones of the wrist, hip, and spine, which possess more trabecular bone, are more susceptible to fractures when exposed to sufficient forces. A major culprit of this disease is a decrease in estrogen. Postmenopausal women and estrogen-deficient men have accelerated bone turnover, where even though bone formation occurs, it is outpaced by the bone resorption that is taking place. It is believed that this may be due to osteoblast dysfunction or loss of template bone from excessive resorption. It is speculated that the decrease in osteoblast function may be due to decreased synthesis or inhibition of local growth factors. Aging is also a risk factor for osteoporosis, where there is a decrease in the number of osteoblasts relative to the demand for bone formation. Bone resorption outpaces bone formation as the body ages.

**Hyperparathyroidism**

This disease process is comprised of primary, secondary, and tertiary causes. Primary hyperparathyroidism may be due to the development of an adenoma or hyperplasia of one or more parathyroid glands, which causes the production and release of excess PTH. The normal homeostatic system does not regulate the production and release of PTH from a parathyroid adenoma; the adenoma does not abide by feedback inhibition. Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency or chronic kidney disease is a state of hypocalcemia that leads to a secondary increase in PTH. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism results from longstanding secondary hyperparathyroidism, where the parathyroid glands have hypertrophied over time and now overproduce PTH, leading to hypercalcemia. Regarding bone remodeling, the mechanism of hyperparathyroidism was discussed in the prior "Mechanism" section.

**Paget Disease of Bone**

Paget disease is a condition of disorganized bone resorption patterns due to abnormal activation of osteoclasts. Along with this distorted resorption comes a strong, irregular osteoblastic response in the form of woven bone. Though bone turnover is present, it is abnormal, leading to architecture with unfavorable integrity and pathologic fractures.

**Osteopetrosis**

Osteopetrosis is a disease that involves the failure of osteoclasts to resorb the bone matrix appropriately, resulting in increased bone mass. Despite increased bone mass, bone integrity is weak due to the inability to resorb older portions of bone.
