The diagnosis and management of ACL are best by an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, orthopedic surgeon, sports physician, nurse practitioner, and a physical therapist. The initial treatment of ACL is RICE therapy. ACL injuries, depending upon their severity, can be managed nonoperatively or operatively. The patient with an anterior cruciate ligament injury should be referred to the orthopedic physician to discuss treatment options and a physical therapist (PT) for rehabilitation. Care coordination between PT and the treating clinician is often the task of a specialty-trained orthopedic nurse, who can also counsel the patient on their condition and treatment. The outcomes for patients with ACL injury are good, but the recovery may take at least 3 to 9 months of intense physical therapy.
