Emergency medicine, family medicine, and ENT providers are often presented with patients, both pediatric and adult, complaining of ear pain. Many of these patients will have otitis media or otitis externa and will receive antibiotic therapy. The scope of practice for the EM or FM practitioner stops at this point.

If the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of acute mastoiditis, they should proceed to an emergency department with ENT coverage as this patient will likely be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics, myringotomy, tympanostomy tube placement, and possible mastoidectomy. Patients who are presenting for frequent episodes of acute otitis media or chronic otitis media who are otherwise stable and no concern for mastoiditis can be safely referred by either EM or FM practitioner to an ENT provider on an outpatient basis for consultation in regards to risk and prevention of mastoiditis.
