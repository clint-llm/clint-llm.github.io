The neonatal EEG total number of electrodes is reduced, given the small head circumference.

The eye electrodes are placed 0.5 cm from the outer canthus. Calibration of montage is necessary to eliminate artifact with a recording speed of 15 mm/s (half from adults), a time constant of 0.3 seconds, 70 Hz low pass filter, and sensitivity of 7 µV/mm. EKG, EMG, and eye electrodes are set at sensitivities of 50 µV/mm, 50 µV/mm, and 7 µV/mm, respectively. These settings may be adjusted as needed and are meant to be guidance. Abnormal sharp spike and slow waves should disrupt the background and be sharply contoured. A recording of at least 2 to 3 hours is recommended to capture waves in the wake and the sleep stages.

The neonatal EEG voltage can be decreased by cooling therapy (head or body cooling) and some medications, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, morphine, and antiepileptic drugs.
