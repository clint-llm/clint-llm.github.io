Asthma is characterized by variable and often reversible airway obstruction with bronchial hyperreactivity. An estimated 8.4% of people in the US have asthma, while 4.3% of the global population is affected. Both the US and global prevalence of asthma continues to rise. Patients with asthma are at an elevated risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality due to bronchospasm and hypoxemia, and children are especially prone to perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE). Preoperative identification and optimization of patients with asthma before elective surgery are critical in preventing harm. A well-planned anesthetic is essential in providing safe and high-quality care for these patients in the perioperative environment. This activity examines the considerations for perioperative care and anesthesia in asthma patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the underlying pathophysiology of asthma.
- Describe the asthma triggers.
- Outline the risk factors shown to increase the incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE) in children.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in the pre- and postoperative management of asthma patients, leading to improved outcomes.
