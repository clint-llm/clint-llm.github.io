All patients with head injuries and post-craniotomy status should be strictly monitored for the development of pneumocephalus. Care of these patients requires the efforts of an interprofessional team that includes clinicians, surgeons, and nursing staff. Nurses should monitor the sensorium, be careful regarding patients' positioning, and give instructions to avoid a Valsalva maneuver. They should contact a clinician if there is a serious change. [Level 5] If the patient develops TP, which leads to a drop in sensorium,Â basic supportive care, including maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by definitive management, should be provided.
