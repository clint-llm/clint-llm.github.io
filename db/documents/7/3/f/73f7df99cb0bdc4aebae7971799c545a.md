Hypothermia takes place when the body dissipates more heat than it absorbs or creates, leaving the body unable to generate sufficient heat to maintain homeostasis and proper bodily function. While the underlying cause of accidental hypothermia is excessive cold stress and inadequate heat generation from the body (thermogenesis), other factors increase the risk of developing hypothermia. Functional central and peripheral nervous systems, along with proper behavioral adaptation, are important components.

Extremes of age, hypoglycemia, malnutrition, and endocrine disorder are examples of heat production inadequacy. Skin disorders (psoriasis and burns) and improper peripheral vasodilation from peripheral dysfunction (peripheral neuropathies and spinal cord injuries) exacerbate heat loss. Cerebrovascular accidents, neurodegenerative disorders, and drug abuse may disrupt the hypothalamic thermoregulation function. In addition to organic causes, impaired behavioral response to cold stress may result in hypothermia for individuals with dementia, drug abuse disorder, or psychiatric condition. Situational circumstances from lack of shelter or clothing may occur in the homeless.

Hypothermia may also be due to drugs like general anesthetics, beta-blockers, meperidine, clonidine, neuroleptics, and alcohol.
