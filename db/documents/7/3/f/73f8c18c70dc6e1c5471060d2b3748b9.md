Vitamin C deficiency is defined as a serum concentration of less than 11.4 umol/L, and prevalence varies across the world, with rates as low as 7.1% in the United States andÂ as high as 73.9% in north India. Risk factors for deficiency include alcohol intake, tobacco use, low-income, male gender, patients on hemodialysis, and those with overall poor nutritional status. Although vitamin C deficiency is common, even in industrialized countries, overt scurvy is rare. Infantile incidence is also uncommon as both breast milk and fortified formula are adequate sources.
