After establishing arsenic toxicity in the patient, and positively identifying the source of arsenic exposure, prevention of further exposure forms the mainstay of treatment. Mild to moderate disease have shown improvement in many such instances.

Treatment of arsenical keratosis is not mandatory, and the objective is to administer a supportive and symptomatic treatment that relieves the patient's discomfort. There are no universally accepted standard guidelines for the treatment of arsenical keratosis. Treatment should be tailored to the patient's needs, the severity of the disease, comorbidities, and tolerance for pain. Treatment options that have been tried over the years are as follows:

- Cryotherapy

- Curettage and electrodessication

- Carbon dioxide laser ablation

- Topical keratolytic agents- salicylic acid (5 to 10%), urea (10 to 20%)

- Imiquimod 5% cream

- Topical 5-fluorouracil

- Oral retinoids

- Surgical excision

Acitretin with topical keratolytic agents can be used to treat patients with extensive lesions. It can play the role of chemoprevention in CAT associated cancers.
