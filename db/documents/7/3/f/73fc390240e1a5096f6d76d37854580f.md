Skin tags or acrochordons should not be considered as an isolated entity as they are more likely to be seen in diabetic patients and individuals with metabolic syndrome. Also, in young females in the second and third decades of life, skin tags may be seen in the presence of polycystic ovarian syndrome; thus, it is important to investigate these patients for these comorbidities. Simply excising the skin tag may improve the cosmesis, but one may miss a metabolic disorder ifs one omits further investigations. Various studies have indicated the correlation of skin tags and metabolic diseases like DM type 2; hence, a complete workup and follow up treatment should be the norm.

Primary care clinicians should be fully aware that even though skin tags have no malignant potential, if they have any doubt about the lesion, they should order a referral to a dermatologist.

Removal of skin tags is a simple and non-eventful procedure when performed by trained individuals. However, the patient has to be encouraged to change his or her lifestyle. Otherwise, the lesions may recur in the future. A dermatology specialty-trained nurse can prove to be an invaluable asset in preparing the patient, assisting during the procedure, attending to the patient post-operatively, and providing patient counsel. The clinician or specialist and the nurse need to function as an interprofessional healthcare team to optimize patient outcomes in these cases. [Level V]
