While Ramsay Hunt syndrome is ideally managed pharmacologically by a primary care provider, specialist consultation with a physician with acute facial paralysis experience may be valuable. An otolaryngologist or facial plastic surgeon may be more familiar with the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome than a general practitioner and likely has easier access to audiometry and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. A neurologist is also helpful in evaluating cranial neuropathies, assisting with electrodiagnostic testing for patients with complete hemifacial paralysis, and may help treat chronic neuralgia. An ophthalmologist can evaluate the health of the cornea with slit lamp examination and fluorescein dye, and both the ophthalmologist and the otolaryngologist should be capable of placing an eyelid weight, if necessary. An internist or endocrinologist may be required to manage blood glucose levels or hypertension during prolonged high-dose steroid administration. Lastly, some patients will require consultation with a behavioral health specialist to assist with managing mood symptoms and anxiety that stem from facial dysfunction.
