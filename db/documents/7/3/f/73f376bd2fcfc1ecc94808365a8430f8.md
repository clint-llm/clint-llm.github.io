Echinococcosis is caused by infection from the parasite Echinococcus (a tapeworm). The life cycle of Echinococcus includes a definitive host (usually dogs) and an intermediate host (like sheep, goats, or swine). Humans are accidental hosts, and they do not play a part in the transmission. Adult tapeworm resides in the small intestine of the definitive host, where it lays eggs containing embryos (oncospheres). These eggs expelled via feces get ingested by the intermediate or incidental host. After being hatched from eggs, oncospheres migrate via blood or lymphatics after piercing the intestinal mucosa to the liver, lungs, or other visceral organs and form cysts. Protoscoleces develop within these cysts. The life cycle gets completed when the definitive host consumes the infected organs of the intermediate host.
