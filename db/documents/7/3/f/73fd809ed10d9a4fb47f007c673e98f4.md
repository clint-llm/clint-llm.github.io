A disruption in the balance between inhibition and excitation, or the glutamate-GABA equilibrium, results in pathologies due to injury (e.g., strokes, Huntingtonâ€™s disease), overexcitation (e.g., epilepsy, spastic disorders), or excessive inhibition (e.g., hypersomnia, benzodiazepine overdose).

Because GABA-agonists such as benzodiazepines depress CNS function, pharmacological management should consider any negative synergistic interactions with ethanol and opioid medications that can result in respiratory insufficiency and excessive somnolence/sedation.

Although benzodiazepines have indications for anxiety disorder, epilepsy, and alcohol withdrawal, they are also common drugs of abuse due to their euphoric effects or unintentional development of tolerance and dependence.
