One of the most common adverse effects of olanzapine is the potential for weight gain. Olanzapine causes an increase in appetite leading to hyperphagia with a consequence of weight gain.

Another adverse effect of olanzapine is the increased risk of metabolic effects. Olanzapine has a high potential to cause reduced insulin sensitivity, leading to impaired glucose tolerance, especially in a younger population.

Olanzapine's mechanism of action also lends itself to directly causing adverse reactions associated with the dopaminergic blockade. Patients have an increased risk of developing akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, the risk of developing these side effects is lesser than first-generation antipsychotics due to the lower affinity and rapid dissociation of olanzapine with the D2 receptors.

Hematological abnormalities such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are reported.****Post-marketing surveillance has also reported cases of hypothermia and edema due to olanzapine.

Samidorphan, a Î¼-opioid receptor antagonist, is approved to reduce olanzapine-associated weight gain.
