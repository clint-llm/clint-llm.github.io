Given that toxocariasis spreads via the fecal-oral route, patient education in hand hygiene is vital in risk factor modification. Also, patients should receive instruction on other risk factors such as exposure to pets and places where animal feces are present such as sandboxes. Common pitfalls amongst healthcare providers include failure to consider this diagnosis in children. The true disease burden is likely underestimated, and while failure to diagnose VLM may not carry acute complications, the chronic and economic burden of disease is likely profound.
