Wrist arthroscopy initially started as a diagnostic tool for intraarticular wrist pathology. With advances in equipment and technology, wrist arthroscopy can now provide significant therapeutic benefits. Management of peripheral avulsions of the TFCC can be successfully managed with arthroscopic repair with 74Â to 93% satisfactory results.

While the orthopedic wrist specialist is center stage for wrist arthroscopy procedures, it requires an interprofessional team to manage the case from end to end. The patient's family clinician can assist with general monitoring following the procedure. Orthopedic and OR nurses will assist during the procedure and provide post-surgical instructions. A physical therapist will direct rehabilitative exercise and report progress back to the managing clinician of their nurse. This approach will bring about the best possible results with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
