The exact cause of Schamberg disease is not known. It is caused by extravasation of blood vessels particularly capillaries which allow red blood cells to get deposited into the skin which then releases their iron from hemoglobin. This iron causes a rust color accounting for the orange or brown tint of the rash.

The exact cause of capillary inflammation is unknown and can be multifactorial. Potential contributors in the etiology can be:

- Gravitational dependency

- Alcohol intake

- Drugs such as acetaminophen, aspirin, adalin, amlodipine, carbromal, chlordiazepoxide, glipizide, glybuzole, hydralazine, meprobamate, nitroglycerin, persantin, reserpine, thiamine, interferon-alfa, injection medroxyprogesterone acetate, topical fluorouracil, and sildenafil

- Genetic causes, as cases are seen in family members

- Hepatitis B antigenemia

- Dysfunctional immune system

- Idiopathic
