Innervation of the wrist jointÂ comes from the:

- anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve

- posterior interosseous branch of the radial nerve

- the dorsal and the deep branches of the ulnar nerve

The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, the posterior interosseous nerve, the dorsal branch and the perforating branches of the ulnar nerve, and the superficial branch of the radial nerve innervate the wrist joint from the dorsum. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, the anterior interosseous nerve, and the main trunk and deep branch of the ulnar nerve innervate the wrist joint from the palmar side.
