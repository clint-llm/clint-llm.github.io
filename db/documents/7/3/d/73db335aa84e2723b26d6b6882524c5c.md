Lung carcinoids are a part of the neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that arise in the lungs. These NETs could show either a typical low-grade, well-differentiated, slow-growing tumor or they may present as atypical high-grade, poorly differentiated carcinomas. However, the NETs share the capacity to synthesize neuropeptides and the presence of submicroscopic cytoplasmic dense-core.
