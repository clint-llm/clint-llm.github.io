All patients must be assessed radiologically after birth, depending on their clinical status. Plain X-rays films show any associated skull defects, bone abnormalities, and deformities of the spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best diagnostic test to study the neural tissue abnormalities and assess any associated hydrocephalus. Ultrasonography to have a quick assessment of hydrocephalus can be helpful. Surgery should be on board to evaluate the need for emergent surgical repair.
