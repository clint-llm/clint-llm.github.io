Because endometriosis and endometriomas are part of a chronic condition that has the potential to be widespread in the body, an interprofessional team approach utilizing the expertise of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs) is essential. The treating clinician must make the diagnosis and decide the course of treatment, including the need for any referrals. Nurses are also critically important team members who can offer patient counsel, perform monitoring, take histories, and report any findings or concerns to the clinician. Since medications are an important part of treatment for patients with more mild forms of endometriosis that do not yet have a cystic component to their disease or do not want surgery, it is important to discuss these treatments with a pharmacist who can help determine the ideal duration and drug to provide these patients with the best relief.

When initially evaluating these patients, most often, a pelvic ultrasound is performed. It is crucial when looking at any adnexal masses to describe them appropriately. There are specific characteristics of endometriomas that raise suspicion when evaluating the images. Therefore, radiologists play an important role in diagnosis. This also helps answer the question of whether or not surgery is most appropriate for each patient. Radiologists can also help indicate whether or not other structures are involved, which is extremely important if surgery does occur.

Endometriosis can lead to multiple adhesions and endometriosis implants. These lesions can, at times, involve the bowel or the bladder. In severe disease, there may be bowel obstructions or ureteral involvement.

If patients do opt for surgical treatment, which is often the case for endometriomas, additional team members come together to provide appropriate care for the patient. Anesthesiologist evaluation of the patient for proper anesthesia is important to assist with a smooth surgery and good post-operative pain control. Nursing care in both the pre-operative and post-operative periods is important to give the patient the appropriate medications at the right time. Finally, pharmacy assistance for appropriate post-op pain control also has an important role in the ideal care of the patient.
