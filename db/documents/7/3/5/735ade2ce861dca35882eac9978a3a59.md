Fetal hemoglobin is of great significance in the pathophysiology of hemoglobinopathies. In alpha thalassemia, one or more of the four alpha-chain genes are deleted on chromosome 16, leading to decreased HbA production and/or abnormal hemoglobin production from beta or gamma chains. The severity is dependent upon the number (1 to 4) of deleted genes. Deletion of a single gene is largely asymptomatic, while the deletion of three genes presents with chronic microcytic anemia and hemolysis that may present with symptoms of fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, and pigmented gallstones. When all four genes are deleted, there is the production of abnormal hemoglobin composed of four gamma chains; the term for this is Hb Barts. Hb Barts is incompatible with life because the gamma chains have too great an affinity for oxygen, and therefore oxygen delivery is significantly impacted. Affected fetuses suffer from a condition known as hydrops fetalis, marked by accumulations of fluid throughout the body, causing ascites, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and scalp edema. This condition results in spontaneous abortion in nearly all cases.
