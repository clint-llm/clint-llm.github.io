Postoperative inflammation, secondary glaucoma, and cystoid macular edema are more common.Â Retinal vasculitis may be the result of severe intraocular inflammation. In addition, rubeosis iridis can be present preoperatively, leading to hyphema post-operatively. Severe complications include absolute glaucoma or phthisis.
