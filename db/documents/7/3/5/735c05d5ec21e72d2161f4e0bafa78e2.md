Bronchial carcinoid tumors (BCTs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors, potentially secreting biologically active chemical substances. They account for 1% to 2% of all lung tumors. BCTs were formerly known as bronchial adenomas, however, this terminology is no longer used as they are not glandular nor are they consistently benign. They are typically a slow-growing neoplasm with varying behavior, however, they can grow rapidly and overall be much more aggressive.
