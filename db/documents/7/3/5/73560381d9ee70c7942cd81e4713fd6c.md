Complications of lateral epicondylitis can include recurrence of the injury when normal activity is resumed, rupture of the tendons with repeated steroid injections, and failure to improve conservative treatment.

Postoperative complications can include the following:

- Failing to address concomitant pathology 

- Patients report inferior outcomes and lack of improvement if the primary cause of symptoms is not addressed; patients should be educated regarding the risks and benefits of surgery; the former include but are not limited to infection, blood loss, neurovascular injury, continued pain, stiffness, or continued or worsening overall dysfunction. 
- Radial nerve entrapment can be missed or not addressed clinically in up to 5% of patients being managed for lateral epicondylitis.

- Iatrogenic LUCL injury

- Occurs iatrogenically with increased risk if the surgical dissection extends beyond the radial head equator 
- Postoperative iatrogenic posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) can develop if the extension or LUCL compromise is significant.

- Iatrogenic neurovascular injury

- Radial nerve injury

- Heterotopic ossification

- Decrease risk via copious saline irrigation following decortication and debridement

- Infection
