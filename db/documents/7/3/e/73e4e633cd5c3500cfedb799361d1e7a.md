A definitive diagnosis of the herald patch can be difficult before the classic eruption of pityriasis rosea. Due to morphological similarities it shares with tinea corporis, a potassium hydroxide prep should be performed to rule this out as it is a simple and effective diagnostic test. If the potassium hydroxide prep is equivocal, a biopsy may be performed which may aid in differentiating the herald patch from tinea, erythema annulare centrifugum, or nummular eczema. When the full eruption of pityriasis roseaÂ finally presents, the palms and soles should be checked for involvement as the eruption can mimic secondary syphilis. If secondary syphilis cannot be ruled out, nontreponemal tests such as the rapid plasma reagin test should be performed with appropriate confirmatory tests if needed.
