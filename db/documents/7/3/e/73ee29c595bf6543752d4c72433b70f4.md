Skin changes during pregnancy may be physiological. However, some dermatoses are specific to pregnancy, while others are altered by pregnancy. These changes occur as a result of an interaction of multiple factors in the body during pregnancy. The dermatoses which are specific to pregnancy include gestational pemphigoid (also known as pemphigoid gestationis); pruritic and urticarial papules, and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP, also known as pruritic eruption of pregnancy and toxemic rash of pregnancy); intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Impetigo herpetiformis, atopic eruption of pregnancy: encompasses atopic eczema in pregnancy, prurigo of pregnancy, as well as pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy in earlier classifications. This activity reviews the evaluation of dermatoses of pregnancy and identifies the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.
