The favored therapy to eliminate the described skin lesions is the effective treatment of the underlying tumor. Paraneoplastic skin lesions as seen in Bazex syndrome do not respond to the classical dermatological therapy of inflammatory skin diseases. Improvement after the treatment with Vitamin D3, salicylic acid, and topic or systemic steroids have been reported. Reported topical treatments include topical corticosteroids, as clobetasol 0.05% or betamethasone 0.01%, salicylic acid 10% in vaseline, itraconazole, isosorbide dinitrate, fluconazole, cephalexin, keratolytic, neomycin, nystatin, zinc ointment, antibiotic, and emollients. Some authors suggest a treatment with oral dexamethasone 10 mg/day leading to a good response of the cutaneous lesions.

In the last decade, anecdotal reports indicate that the use of both systemic and topical retinoids may help ease the skin lesions. Early initiation of acitretin has been reported to be effective in the amelioration of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica in a patient with an incurable primary malignancy.

There are even reports indicating that supplementation of zinc may help ease the skin lesions.
