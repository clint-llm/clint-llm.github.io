Nuclear medicine scans are safe as radiopharmaceuticals contain a trace amount of the biological compound. Contraindications would relate to the appropriateness of the test ordered according to the latest guidelines and appropriateness use criteria. Proper quality control of radiopharmaceuticals injected should be performed. Adverse events are rare but may occur more so with WBC-based radiopharmaceuticals or antibody-based radiopharmaceuticals (though not as frequently used anymore). Additionally, proper workflows need to be in place for safe radiopharmaceutical administration, especially radiolabelled white blood cells.
