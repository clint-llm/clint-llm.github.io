The Romberg test assesses the integrity of the posterior column pathway, which carries vibratory sensations. The examiner asks the patient to close his/her eyes while standing. Â If the patient can not maintain his/her balance with eyes closed, the problem lies in the posterior column, and not in the cerebellum.
