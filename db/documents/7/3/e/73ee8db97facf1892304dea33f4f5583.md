Seizures are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a nurse practitioner, primary care provider, neurologist, pharmacist, and neurosurgeon. Once treated, these patients are often followed as outpatients by the primary care provider. It is vital that the nurse and primary care provider educate the patient on safety and compliance with treatment. Depending on the medication, drug levels may need to be obtained regularly. In addition, the pharmacist should keep track of the patient's medications to ensure that no drug interactions occur. The outlook for patients with seizures depends on the chronicity.
