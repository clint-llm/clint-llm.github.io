The exact etiology of akathisia is unknown, but it is thought to be due to antipsychotic agents blocking dopamine type-2 receptors in the brain.

The general belief is that there is an imbalance between cholinergic/dopaminergic or serotonergic/dopaminergic systems. The organ where this imbalance occurs is most likely the shell of the nucleus accumbens.
