Assisting patients with basic hygiene not only creates a personal connection between the health care provider and the patient but also is vital to maintaining the patientâ€™s health. It is the responsibility of the health care professional to balance the proper amount of grooming. Both too much grooming, as well as too little grooming, can have negative effects. There are various health care settings and a variety of patients; thus, it is necessary to determine how much assistance is necessary for each patient on a case by case scenario. Patients should be allowed to assist with their hygiene to the best of their ability. Assistance may be needed for tasks such as eliminating, shaving, brushing and styling hair, oral care, and bathing.
