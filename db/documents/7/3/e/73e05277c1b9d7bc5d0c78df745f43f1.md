The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) issued a guideline for routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures. They recommend against routine radiographic, cardiac, or laboratory testing before endoscopy for otherwise healthy patients, but recommend selective testing based on patient's and procedure's risk factors. They recommend a pregnancy test when appropriate, hemoglobin/hematocrit, and blood typing and screening in patients with anemia, bleeding, or when blood loss is expected during the procedure. Coagulation studies are also indicated in patients with bleeding or bleeding disorders, biliary diseases, or poor nutrition. A chest radiograph is only indicated if the patient has respiratory or cardiac symptoms. Other laboratory testing should be ordered based on the patient's medical history. As with other procedures that require sedation, patients need to be fasting before the procedure.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended prior to ERCP. However, it is recommended in patients with a liver transplant or biliary obstruction. Biliary flora, including enterococci and gram-negative organisms, should be covered, and antibiotics should be continued after ERCP if biliary drainage is incomplete.
