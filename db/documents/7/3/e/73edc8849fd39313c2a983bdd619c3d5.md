**Management**

Phenobarbital overdose is a healthcare emergency and requires teamwork from the entire healthcare spectrum to help the patient. It is imperative to implement the management of cardiac and respiratory status quickly.

Treatment of phenobarbital toxicity is supportive, comprising maintenance of airway function (through endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation), correction of bradycardia, and hypotension (with IV fluids and vasopressors, if necessary).
