It is of importance to differentiate inflammatory from noninflammatory arthritis. The most common form of non-inflammatory arthritis is osteoarthritis which usually has an insidious onset and gradually worsens. Typical joints involved in primary osteoarthritis include the knees, hips, lumbar spine, 1st metatarsophalangeal joints in the feet, proximal and distal interphalangeal joints in the hands, and 1st carpometacarpal joint in the wrist. Repetitive use or injuries can lead to the involvement of other joints as well, such as the shoulders, elbows, ankles, and wrists. It can be symmetric or non-symmetric. Bony hypertrophy changes can be palpable on the exam, especially in the hands and feet. The joint can be tender and swollen, but erythema or warmth is usually absent. Synovial fluid analysis reveals noninflammatory fluid. Radiographs can show characteristic osteoarthritic changes with loss of joint space and osteophytes. Erosions are rare, but central "gull-wing" erosions can be seen in erosive osteoarthritis of the hands involving the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.
