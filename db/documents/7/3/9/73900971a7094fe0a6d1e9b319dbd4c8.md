Oral contraceptive pills provide patients with the option to prevent pregnancy. If the patient has medical conditions that put them at increased risk for taking combined OC or progestinÂ  OC, the prescriber should inform patients of many alternatives to prevent pregnancy. OC's are a choice made by the patient and her clinician after adequate counseling of risks and benefits. There are significant non-contraceptive uses of hormonal contraceptives, and these should be considered when counseling the patient about her options. Many OC formulations can provide menstrual regularity, treating both menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. They can even be utilized to induce amenorrhea for lifestyle considerations.

The birth control pill is prescribed by many healthcare workers, including the physician assistant, nurse practitioner, physicians, obstetricians, internists, and gynecologists. Patients' health benefits can influence the choice of contraceptive pills, so pharmacists should guide prescribers to choose affordable options for individual patients. Nurses should inform the patient about the potential adverse reactions and monitor patient vitals at each visit.
