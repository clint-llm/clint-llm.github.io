The etiology of this dermatosis remains unknown despite an active search for a causative agent. However, there are many factors in favor of viral origin, such as the involvement of several children in a single family, serologic findings, upper respiratory tract or digestive prodromes, antibiotic inefficiency, and epidemics in the spring.

Virologic examination seems to support this assumption. However, more than one virus appears to be capable of evoking the disease.

Duarte et al. considered a relationship to infections with parainfluenza virus 2 or 3, adenovirus, human herpesvirus 6 or 7, and Epstein–Barr virus.

There is a report of asymmetric periflexural exanthem of childhood in a 3-year-old girl following an upper respiratory tract infection and the onset of axonal Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Other possible causes of APEC merited consideration by various authors including insect bites, bacterial infections, and contact dermatitis; however, these assumptions remain unproven. There is no documentation of interhuman transmission.
