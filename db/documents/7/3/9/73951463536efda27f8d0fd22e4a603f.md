MCV is an essential value for determining the type of anemia and risk of cardiovascular events, but it is not the only value on the CBC used. Some physicians do not pay as much attention to MCV, especially if a patient could have a cause of microcytic and macrocytic anemia together. It is crucial that clinicians treat patients based on history, physical examination, and multiple values outside of MCV to eventually inform their patients of their underlying etiologies and ensure proper treatment and management of their conditions.
