Treatment depends on the preservation of the extensor mechanism. Any injury causing impaired knee extension usually requires surgical repair and orthopedic consultation. The prognosis is favorable if the injury is diagnosed and treated early.

Treatment for partial extensor injuries may depend on the patient. Young, active patients would benefit from early surgical repair to regain function. Older patients with significant comorbidities may benefit from a trial of nonoperative management, which requires placing the patient in a knee immobilizer with instructions for a progressive range of motion and weight-bearing plan. Whether an operative or nonoperative course is trialed, patients should expect to return to full activity after 6 months of extensive rehabilitation.

Treatment for patellar fractures again depends on the preservation of the extensor mechanism and the type of fracture. Conservative treatment is appropriate for stable, non-displaced fractures with a preserved extensor mechanism. To test this, the fracture must remain stable when the knee is flexed up to 60 degrees. Comminuted fractures may be treated nonoperatively if they fall into this category. Vertically oriented fractures are more likely to be stable and heal, while horizontal or transversely oriented fractures are at higher risk of further displacement, non-union, and loss of extension. The patient should be placed in a knee immobilizer with a limitation of knee flexion. The degree of flexion and weight-bearing is increased in a stepwise fashion. Surgical repair is appropriate for unstable fractures or fractures that impair the extensor mechanism.

For patients with patellar dislocations, if the patella is still dislocated on examination, it may be reduced based on clinical diagnosis alone without imaging. However, if there is any concern for associated bony injuries, or the patient is elderly with a first-time dislocation, a plain film should be considered before reduction. If the patella is unable to be reduced, orthopedic surgery should be consulted. If the injury is successfully reduced on the initial evaluation, the patient can be placed in a knee immobilizer with instructions to follow up with orthopedic surgery or sports medicine in 1 to 2 weeks. In most cases, conservative management is trialed first. Patients with a medially dislocated patella may require surgery for reduction. Patients with chronic dislocation may benefit from operative repairs, such as MPFL reconstruction or graft, to aid in patellar stability.

As Osgood Schlatter disease and ICP are overuse tendinopathies, patients should be advised to rest from strenuous physical activity. Other recommendations include activity modification, ice packs, and NSAIDs. Physical therapy focuses on the strengthening of quadriceps, especially VMO, as well as core, glute, and hamstrings. Eccentric exercises are preferred for tendinopathies. Jumping biomechanics may need to be corrected in athletes if there is any genu varum or valgum.
