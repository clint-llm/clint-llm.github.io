Given the wide range of symptoms and a lack of clear diagnostic criteria, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) established an interprofessional task force to develop a consensus on recommendations and the clinical definition of refeeding syndrome. ASPEN proposed unifying diagnostic criteria to stratify patients based on 3 levels of severity (mild, moderate, severe):

- Mild - a decrease in any 1, 2, or 3 of serum phosphorus, potassium, and/or magnesium levels by 10% to 20%

- Moderate - a decrease in any 1, 2, or 3 of serum phosphorus, potassium, and/or magnesium levels by 20% to 30%

- Severe - a decrease in any 1, 2, or 3 of serum phosphorus, potassium, and/or magnesium levels by >30% and/or organ dysfunction resulting from a decrease in any of these and/or due to thiamine deficiency (severe), occurring within 5 days of a reintroduction of calories

Though ASPEN guidelines provide a reasonable working definition, it should be noted this definition has limitations in assessing nutritional status as the guideline only relies on laboratory changes rather than capturing a patient’s clinical presentation. Additionally, laboratory values such as albumin and prealbumin are often used in the assessment of nutrition, with prealbumin being a better assessment of short-term nutritional changes compared to albumin; the half-life of prealbumin is 2 to 3 days, while the half-life of albumin is around 20 days. These markers are unreliable as they are acute phase reactants.

Refeeding syndrome is a severe and potentially lethal condition that should be readily recognized to ensure vulnerable patients are appropriately diagnosed and managed to avoid reaching a critically ill state with electrolyte abnormalities that are seemingly refractory to correction - leading to a high risk of mortality. The heterogeneity of refeeding syndrome definitions and lack of robust scientific data are particularly harmful to high-risk patients requiring additional nutritional support. Accordingly, there is a need for further understanding of refeeding syndrome for improved diagnosis and prevention.
