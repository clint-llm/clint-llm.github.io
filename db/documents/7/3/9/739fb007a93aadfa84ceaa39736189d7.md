Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia, a history of stroke or myocardial infarction in the past year, or a history of hypersensitivity to romosozumab or any component of its formulation. Romosozumab should immediately be discontinued should a myocardial infarction or stroke occur during treatment.

Romosozumab is also not recommended in patients who have completed romosozumab therapy for 12 months, as its effects wane. Furthermore, while ongoing studies, romosozumab is not currently FDA-approved for use in premenopausal patients.
